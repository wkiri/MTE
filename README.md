# Mars Target Encyclopedia (MTE)

This project uses natural language processing to analyze scientific
publications for discoveries about named targets from the surface of
Mars.  It combines information from all publications into a concise
encyclopedia entry for each target that collects all known discoveries
that relate to the target.
