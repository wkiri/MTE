# Mars Target Encyclopedia (MTE)

This project uses natural language processing to analyze scientific
publications for discoveries about named targets from the surface of
Mars.  It combines information from all publications into a concise
encyclopedia entry for each target that collects all known discoveries
that relate to the target.

You can access the Mars Target Encyclopedia:
* The latest MTE database (.csv files): 
  https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mte/mte.htm 
  (currently contains information for the Mars Pathfinder, 
  Mars Phoenix Lander, and Mars Exploration Rover missions)
* PDS Analyst's Notebook (go to Search->Targets):
  https://an.rsl.wustl.edu/msl/mslbrowser/an3.aspx 
  (Mars Science Laboratory)

If you're interested in installing/running the MTE system to parse 
publications and generate new database content, see the MTE wiki:
