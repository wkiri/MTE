Supporting files:

1. Results from manual review of MER targets (using Mission Manager
reports) in 2019:
- MERA-closeout-targets.txt
- MERA-closeout-features.txt (TBD)
- MERB-closeout-targets.txt (TBD)
- MERB-closeout-features.txt (TBD)

2. Contact science targets from PDS (informed by #1):
(source: https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/mer/urn-nasa-pds-mer_cs_target_list/document/overview.txt)
- mera_cs_target_list.csv ; unique targets stored in Spirit-targets.txt
- merb_cs_target_list.csv ; unique targets stored in Opportunity-targets.txt
Column 4 of the .csv files yields 137 unique Spirit targets and 387
unique Opportunity targets.

3. We also used files from Scott VanBommel (4/14/2021) for additional
vetting of remote sensing targets (MI and Pancam tabs), which are not
included in this repository:
- SolSummary_A.xlsx
- SolSummary_B.xlsx
