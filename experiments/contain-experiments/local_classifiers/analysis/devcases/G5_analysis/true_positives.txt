sentence:The K - feldspar and illite clays identified in the Dillinger member by CheMin [ 10 ] are consistent with this enrichment in K. Overall the K abundance gradually increases between the lower Striated unit ( Liga and Square_Top members ) and the Rugged unit ( Dillinger and Mt. Remarkable members ) in the Kimberley formation .
