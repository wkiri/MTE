As compared to the large number of secondary resistance mutations noted in acquired imatinib resistance in CML , in the case of EGFR-TK , there are currently only several documented resistance point mutations to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ , ] , L747S [ ] and D761Y [ ] .	34	39	resistance or non-response
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation results in alteration of the topology of the ATP binding pocket not only interrupting the physicochemical binding of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , but also leading to much increased affinity of the EGFR protein to ATP resulting in resistance to EGFR-TKIs [ ] .	21	1	resistance or non-response
Median PFS and OS for the 217 patients who received erlotinib were 14 and 27 months , patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> had longer PFS than patients with exon 19 deletions and outcomes did not seem to differ whether erlotinib was given in the first or second-line setting . A combined survival analysis ( I-CAMP ) of seven prospective Japanese trials of 148 patients with EGFR mutations who received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> demonstrated a response rate of 76.4 % , median PFS of 9.7 months and overall survival of 24.3 months [ ] .	67	19	sensitivity
The WJTOG3405 study enrolled 177 chemotherapy-naïve patients aged 75 years or younger and diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer or postoperative recurrence harboring EGFR mutations- either exon 19 deletions <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ ] . Patients were randomly assigned to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or cisplatinum/docetaxel for 3-6 cycles .	41	31 32	sensitivity
H1975 cells , which also contain a second mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) linked to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance [ ] , responded poorly to either agent .	14	10	resistance or non-response
In particular , H1975 cells contain a second mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) reported to be linked to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance [ ] , but we found that these cells also responded poorly to cetuximab .	17	10	resistance or non-response
In this study , we used a group of cancer cell lines with either overexpressed or tyrosine kinase domain mutated ( ΔE746-A750 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) EGFR to assess their responsiveness to cetuximab <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment and to evaluate HIF-1α as novel molecular marker for the therapeutic responses of the cancer cells to EGFR targeted therapy .	32 33	22 23	sensitivity
Therefore , in this study we explored the retained antitumor activity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in resistant HCC827-GR5 and NCI-H1975 NSCLC cells , carrying MET amplification and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , respectively .	12	25	resistance or non-response
The 20-30 % of cell growth inhibition observed at 1μM might be ascribed to the presence of a small sub-population of previously <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cells that during the period of gefitinib deprivation might expand and subsequently arrested when re-exposed to the drug . The restoration of drug sensitivity after EGFRTKI withdrawal has been previously reported by Chmielecki et al. in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistant PC9 cells after multiple passages without the inhibitor [ ] .	22 23	60	resistance or non-response
The 20-30 % of cell growth inhibition observed at 1μM might be ascribed to the presence of a small sub-population of previously quiescent gefitinib-sensitive cells that during the period <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> deprivation might expand and subsequently arrested when re-exposed to the drug . The restoration of drug sensitivity after EGFRTKI withdrawal has been previously reported by Chmielecki et al. in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistant PC9 cells after multiple passages without the inhibitor [ ] .	29 30	60	resistance or non-response
Of note , the continuous exposure of H1975 cells , carrying the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> did not modify their migratory phenotype , possibly because of the low affinity of the mutated receptor for this drug .	16	12	resistance or non-response
However , the discovery of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations and the response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , deeply changed the management of advanced NSCLC in the last decade [ – ] . Small in-frame deletions in exon 19 and point mutations within exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) are the most common EGFR activating mutations both leading to sustained activity of the kinase .	26	58	sensitivity
The most commonly identified mechanism of resistance is an EGFR mutation at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , resulting in substitution of a threonine residue with methionine , which abrogates the ability of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib to inhibit EGFR [ , ] .	33	15	resistance or non-response
Since the first reports of an association between somatic mutations in EGFR exons 19 and 21 and response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , treatment of NSCLC has changed dramatically [ , ] . It has been shown that exon 19 deletions are more sensitive to erlotinib inhibition than the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , a finding demonstrated by kinetic analysis [ ] and also confirmed in clinical studies [ - ] .	19	47	sensitivity
Screening for such mutations in lung cancers identifies patients who will have a clinical responsiveness to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , . Since the existence of EGFR gene mutations ( exon 19 deletions or the exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) were reported as a predictive factor for sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs , several studies based their research on this conclusion , .	16	34	sensitivity
In studies where mutation types were reported individually the most common EGFR mutations were exon 19 deletions ( 53 % ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations ( 38 % ) . Characteristics of the studies included in the pooled analysis to evaluate the effects of single-agent erlotinib , single-agent <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC ( studies not included in the original analysis are highlighted )	47	22	sensitivity
Icotinib Ren et al. [ ] Ph I ; single-arm n = 7 : Chinese ; previously treated ; exon 19 deletion ( n = 3 ) ; <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( n = 4 ) Icotinib ( varied dose and schedule ) PFS : 141 days ( 4.6 months ) Sun et al.

However , a significant PFS benefit of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> compared with chemotherapy was reported in patients with established EGFR mutated-disease ( 9.5 months versus 6.3 months , respectively , HR = 0.48 , 95 % CI 0.36–0.64 P & lt ; 0.0001 ) [ ] . Obviously , clinical characteristics are not an appropriate surrogate for EGFR mutation testing . Furthermore , although common mutations , such as exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in exon 21 have been associated with response to EGFR TKIs , many other mutations are detected only occasionally , and correlations with response are not defined .	7	71	sensitivity
Furthermore , although common mutations , such as exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in exon 21 have been associated with response to EGFR TKIs , many other mutations are detected only occasionally , and correlations with response are not defined . A recent study screened 681 cases and found 18 rare mutations ; responses to EGFR TKIs were reported on a case by case basis and varied by mutation [ ] . For example , exon 20 and 21 mutations were more likely to confer resistance to erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , while exon 18 and 19 mutations were more often associated with improved efficacy outcome .	90	12	sensitivity
Exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations have shown similar in vitro sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] ; however , erlotinib and gefitinib have shown different clinical efficacy depending on whether exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations are present [ , ] .	13	4	sensitivity

All EGFR mutated patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib invariably develop acquired resistance to this kind of therapy , ( Figure ) . The most common and first identified mutation is the threonine-790 to methionine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) point mutation in exon 20 which represents approximately 50 % of all acquired resistance in NSCLC .	6	36	resistance or non-response
Neratinib ( HKI-272 ) , one of the three agents investigated , has n't shown good RR when tested on patients with known <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , therefore further development of this drug in lung cancer has been halted . Afatinib ( BIBW2992 ) is being investigated as part of the LUX-Lung program which aims to evaluate the use of TKI in second- or third-line treatment in patients who have acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib ( LUX-Lung 1 , 4 and 5 ) as well as the use of TKIs as a first-line treatment in patients with EGFR activating mutations ( LUX-Lung 2 , 3 and 6 ) .	72	23	resistance or non-response
The G719S mutation renders the tumor less sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , while erlotinib and the second-generation TKI afatinib have proven to be effective in tumors characterized by this substitution . Dacomitinib ( PF-00299804 ) is another irreversible TKI able to target the activity of all HER TKs and has shown activity in NSCLC cell lines harbouring the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation7 .	9	57	resistance or non-response
The magenta ball-stick ( located just above the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> molecule in the active site ) indicates the gatekeeper residue ( threonine790 ) that is commonly mutated to methionine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , resulting in reduced inhibitor binding and drug resistance .	8	29	resistance or non-response
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation renders the tumor less sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , while erlotinib and the second-generation TKI afatinib have proven to be effective in tumors characterized by this substitution .	9	1	sensitivity
Molecular studies on the receptors harbouring a known <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation demonstrated a decreased affinity of the tyrosine kinase for ATP and an increase in the affinity for the tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) . These are drugs studied to specifically target the pathways of oncogenesis mediated by the EGFR hyper-activation and causing little harm to non-tumoral cells . There is evidence supporting a different sensitivity of NSCLCs to the TKI <ANNO_TYPE_drug> depending on the presence of an exon 21 mutation or an exon 19 deletion , having deletions at exon 19 been associated with a better response .	71	8	sensitivity
This has been reported by several prospective trials of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib in EGFR mutated NSCLC , which showed RRs exceeding 70 % in tumors with exon 19 deletions or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , with PFS intervals of 6-14 months and OS times beyond 20-24 months- .	9	31	sensitivity
An experiment using cell lines transfected concurrently with activating mutations and a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation also proved that resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib is evident when this mutation is present [ – ] .	19	12	resistance or non-response
To address this issue , Inukai et al. proposed a clonal selection model of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant cells [ ] . They used a highly sensitive method , that is , a mutant enriched PCR assay to analyze clinical specimens from 280 sample cases who were not treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and they detected 9 cases ( 3.6 % ) with a 790M mutation .	48	14	resistance or non-response

Mutation was detected by direct sequencing in only one of the 9 cases ; therefore the fraction of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant cells may have been considerably small .	28	62	resistance or non-response
Inukai et al. hypothesized that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment may lead to the selection of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant cells and that even a small fraction of T790M positive tumor cells at the beginning of treatment could lead to clinical gefitinib resistance because of selective proliferation of T790M mutant cells .	5	13	resistance or non-response

Although rare , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations exist as major clones irrespective of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> administration in certain patients [ , ] .	11	3	resistance or non-response
Maheswaran et al. proposed that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> may initially arise because of these oncogenic characteristics and may rapidly emerge as a dominant allele after treatment [ ] . 2.2 . MET Gene Amplification In 2007 , a research group at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute reported that MET gene amplification is involved in acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	54	5	resistance or non-response
The authors established <ANNO_TYPE_drug> clones from a sensitive cell line with EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations ( HCC827 ) by exposing the cells to increasing concentrations of gefitinib . In these resistant cells , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations were not observed but MET gene amplification occurred .	3	34	resistance or non-response

Conversely , when the MET signal was suppressed in resistant cells that were dependent on MET amplification , sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was clearly restored . In the analysis of clinical specimens from 18 cases of acquired resistance , MET gene amplification was observed in 4 cases ( 22 % ) , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations were present in 10 of 18 cases , more than half as many as were expected .	20	52	resistance or non-response
However , the frequency of all such mutations appears to be low in comparison with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and further analysis of such cases is required in the future . 2.4.2 . IGF-1R Guix et al. established <ANNO_TYPE_drug> clones from a gefitinib-sensitive cell line of squamous cell lung carcinoma that amplified the wild-type EGFR gene ( A431 ) by exposing the cells to increasing concentrations of gefitinib [ ] .	37	16	resistance or non-response

Ercan et al. established a resistant cell line for an irreversible EGFR-TKI by subjecting a reversible EGFR-TKI resistant cell line with a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( established by long-term exposure of exon 19 deletion mutant PC9 cells to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) to long-term exposure to PF-00299804 [ ] .	37	22	resistance or non-response

Deletion mutations , mainly occurring around codons 746–750 in exon 19 , and the substitution of leucine with arginine at codon 858 in exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) comprise approximately 90 % of these mutations [ ] . These mutations are more prevalent in Asians , women , non smokers , and patients with adenocarcinoma , groups that match the highly <ANNO_TYPE_drug> clinical subset [ ] .	61	25 26	sensitivity
2. Acquired resistance mechanism 1 ) Secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of the EGFR gene Unfortunately , many of those patients who originally had responded eventually become insensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib therapy through acquired resistance .	27	7	resistance or non-response
Interestingly , it was discovered that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation does not confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib by preventing their binding as originally thought .	14	7	resistance or non-response
Although the resistant cell line HCG827GR does not have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , it was found to have MET amplification . MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is associated with the development of various human cancers . Therefore , EGFR-TKIs fail to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway dependent growth signal because the constitutive phosphorylation of HER3 by MET occurs independent of EGFR activation , which causes the cells to acquire resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	11	resistance or non-response
In cancer tissues from lung adenocarcinoma patients who showed resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , high expression levels of HGF were observed in the lung cancer cells that did not harbor the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or MET amplification .	11	30	resistance or non-response
Moreover , in all the 4 cases with MET amplification , a higher expression of HGF was observed after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment than before treatment . These results indicate that HGF accelerates the expansion of the tumor cells with MET amplification . The cells with MET amplification as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was present in a small proportion of the tumor cells before EGFR-TKI treatment and became dominant during treatment with EGFR-TKIs , suggesting that HGF may play an important role in this process .	19	48	resistance or non-response
To test this possibility , two types of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cells ( PC9 cells that endogenously express EGFR deletion mutant in exon19 of EGFR gene and HEK293T cells that exogenously express EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant ) were transfected with an expression vector encoding the oncogenic K-Ras G12V mutant .	8	31	sensitivity
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib represent the first generation of small EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) that selectively target the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR , blocking the downstream signaling of the receptor . The EGFR somatic mutations have emerged to be the most relevant predictor of response to these agents. , Thus , several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that the use of EGFR TKIs in patients with advanced treatment-naive NSCLC with EGFR mutations significantly improved the objective response rate ( ORR ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) compared with standard platinum based chemotherapy.– Unfortunately , all responders eventually develop resistance , most commonly because of the emergence of a gatekeeper mutation in the kinase domain , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR mutated NSCLC or amplification of mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor ( c-Met ) .	0	122	resistance or non-response
At present , the Genius study ( NCT01579630 ) is ongoing to compare the efficacy and safety of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> versus pemetrexed alone as maintenance therapy in patients EGFR mutation negative or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> single mutation who responded to pemetrexed/platinum as first-line therapy .	18	31	resistance or non-response
Otherwise , CO-1686 is a novel irreversible mutant-selective inhibitor of EGFR , able to target both the initial activating EGFR mutations as well as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary acquired resistance mutation . To investigate its use as a single agent , CO-1686 is being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients previously treated with first-line <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib ( NCT01526928 ) .	57	25	resistance or non-response
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> second mutation accounts for half of all resistances to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib [ ] .	11	1	resistance or non-response
However , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation may exist in only a small fraction of tumor cells before drug treatment , and the tumor cells harboring this mutation may be enriched over time during treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] .	34	3	resistance or non-response
The types of EGFR mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> responding patients worldwide are quite similar [ ] . Such mutations include multiple overlapping deletion mutations of exon 19 in 45 % of patients , point mutations in exon 21 in 40 % of patients ( predominantly <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , and point or insertion mutations in exons 18 to 21 in the remaining 15 % of patients [ ] .	6	44	sensitivity

Years have passed since mutations of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain were discovered in patients with NSCLC , and these patients had dramatic clinical responses to treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Mutations in the exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domains of EGFR , including in-frame deletions in exon 19 and a T-to-G substitution in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , have been found in a subset of lung adenocarcinoma ( - ) .	28	56	sensitivity
These 20 patients were treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as third-line therapy . Overall , EGFR mutations were found in 3 ( 15 % ) out of the 20 patients , including in-frame deletions within exon 19 ( n=2 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missence mutaion in exon 21 ( n=1 ) .	6	39	sensitivity
The secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation within the EGFR kinase domain is a major mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) in NSCLC [ ] . However , clinical response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has been demonstrated to be not correlated with EGFR levels , and several other molecular mechanisms are also important in predicting clinical response [ , ] .	34	2	resistance or non-response

Several researchers have identified somatic mutations in the EGFR gene and have discovered that these mutations were associated with a higher likelihood of clinical response to treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib [ - , ] . EGFR gene mutations were most frequently detected in a subpopulation of NSCLC patients with characteristics associated with a better treatment outcome : female sex , non smokers patients , Asian origin , adenocarcinoma histology . The more common EGFR mutations are an in frame deletion in exon 19 around codons 746 to 750 and a missense mutation leading to leucine to arginine substitution at codon 858 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 21 [ ] .	28	103	sensitivity

EGFR mutations were analysed in 10 of 27 patients by direct sequencing of paraffin embedded tumour samples extracted before initiation of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy .

The EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib have shown marked therapeutic effects against NSCLCs with EGFR activating mutations , such as exon 19 deletions and L858R point mutations [ ] .

In this study , we show that the combination of a selective MEK inhibitor and a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor is effective against tumor cell lines refractory to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by three different mechanisms : an EGFR gatekeeper <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , MET amplification , and KRAS/PIK3CA mutation .	26	35	resistance or non-response

While the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation represents a direct mechanism for drug resistance that occurs at the level of drug accessibility to the target , there are a number of indirect mechanisms that involve the increased expression or activation of alternative growth factor receptors to maintain signal flux , despite EGFR inhibition .

EGFR–TKIs such <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib attain a response rate of approximately 70 % and progression-free survival of 9–13 months , although subgroups of patients experience long lasting remission. , Use of EGFR–TKIs as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations improved progression-free survival with acceptable toxicity , compared with standard chemotherapy . EGFR–TKIs are currently considered a standard first-line treatment for this disease entity.– However , these tumors eventually develop resistance to EGFR–TKIs , possibly as a result of a secondary threonine–methionine substitution mutation at position 790 in exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , MET amplification , or hepatocyte growth factor overexpression in relapsed tumors .	2 3	94 95 96	resistance or non-response

The presence of mutations in the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients has been regarded as a predictive marker of good response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib . Nearly 90 % of these mutations occur as either multinucleotide in-frame deletions in exon 19 or as single missense mutations that result in substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 21 .	44	80	sensitivity

A number of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , lapatinib ) and antibodies ( eg , trastuzumab , cetuximab , panitumumab ) targeting the erbB family have been developed to treat breast , colorectal , lung , gastric and head and neck squamous cell cancers [ ] . Despite the improvements achieved in patients treated with reversible inhibitors of EGFR or EGFR and HER2 , primary and acquired resistances to these agents remain a clinical challenge .

Among the mechanisms by which cancer cells become resistant to reversible EGFR-TKIs are 1 ) gatekeeper mutations in EGFR , such as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> second mutation [ , ] ; 2 ) activation of bypass signaling caused by Met amplification [ ] , hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) overexpression [ ] , or Gas6-Axl activation [ ] ; 3 ) activation of downstream molecules ( PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutation ) [ , ] ; 4 ) small-cell lung cancer transformation [ ] ; and 5 ) epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [ ] . The gatekeeper EGFR-T790M mutation is the most frequent , occurring in half of tumors with acquired resistance to reversible EGFR-TKIs . The methionine residue at position 790 generates a bulkier side chain , which enhances the affinity of the EGFR tyrosine kinase pocket with ATP [ ] , decreasing the effective binding of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib to the tyrosine kinase pocket of EGFR [ ] .	144	23	resistance or non-response

<ANNO_TYPE_variant> and MET amplification account for approximately 60–70 % of all known causes of acquired resistance to gefitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ; these amplifications are not mutually exclusive and can be detected in the same resistant tumor or may occur independently in different metastatic sites in the same patient .	18 19	0	resistance or non-response
This was the case for both primary tumors and the cells that had acquired TKI resistance via the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . This finding might open a new , unexpected therapeutic avenue for the clinical management of EMT-driven , acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	42	19	resistance or non-response
Sequist et al that studied neratinib to overcome <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation reported responses in G719X EGFR mutation , supporting the need of genetic information on trials of targeted agents . According to Ramalingam et al , dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , with acceptable toxicity .	42	8	resistance or non-response
Consistent with the increased sensitivity to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> of patient tumors harboring the missense mutations or exon 19 deletions , anchorage independent growth of cells expressing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , G719S , or L747_E749del A750P was inhibited by 100 nM erlotinib ( A and B ) or gefitinib ( B and unpublished data ) , although the G719S mutant may be somewhat more resistant to gefitinib ( A and unpublished data ) , consistent with other in vitro studies [ ] .	8	27	sensitivity

Calculated IC50 values for gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and CL-387,785 against D770_N771insNPG were 2.6 μM , 2.5 μM , and 0.2 μM , respectively . CL-387,785 had an even greater effect on colony formation by cells expressing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR , completely inhibiting transformation at 0.003 μM ( unpublished data ) .	6	37	sensitivity
Insertion mutant autophosphorylation is less sensitive to inhibition by gefitinib than that of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , but CL-387,785 is more effective than gefitinib at inhibiting insertion mutant ( and L858R ) autophosphorylation . Discussion Treatment with the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has led to dramatic responses in many lung cancer patients , predominantly for those cancers in which EGFR mutations can be detected .	40	13	sensitivity
Transformation induced by expression of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , G719S , and L747_E749del A750P EGFR , but not EGF stimulated wild-type EGFR or D770_N771insNPG EGFR , was inhibited by 0.1 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	28 29	5	sensitivity

Transformation by cells expressing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR was inhibited by 0.1 μM gefitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , whereas transformation by cells expressing the insertion mutant was resistant to low concentrations of these inhibitors .	13 14	5	sensitivity
Tumors from patients with clinical responses to the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> have been shown to contain EGFR deletion mutations or substitution mutations [ , ,, ] , but no exon 20 insertion mutations have been reported in this group of clinical responders . Although exon 20 mutations were not widely reported at first , recently five large-scale studies that sequenced EGFR exons 18 through 21 reported a total of 18 exon 20 insertions out of 350 EGFR mutations identified in 1,108 non-small-cell lung cancers [ – ] . Patients who responded to gefitinib and subsequently relapsed were found to have <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutations , also in exon 20 [ , ] .	12	102	resistance or non-response
This compound was previously found to be active against EGFR containing the exon 20 point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , associated with resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	24	16	resistance or non-response
The most common activating mutations ( ~90 % ) are in-frame deletions in exon 19 of EGFR and a missense mutation at 858 in exon 21 of EGFR resulting in an arginine to leucine substitution ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] . Therapeutic agents targeting the EGFR signaling pathway , including two EGFR kinase inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , are clinically effective in treating lung cancer patients harboring these EGFR activating mutations [ – ] .	56	36	sensitivity
The data suggest that low BRCA1 level may neutralize the negative effects of the EGFR T790M mutation on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity and that high BRCA1 expression may lead to de novo EGFR TKI resistance potentially through increased DNA damage repair capacity [ ] . In addition to EGFR T790M , primary EGFR TKI resistance may also be due to other secondary mutations in EGFR ( e.g. , D761Y ) that occur in cis with an activating EGFR kinase domain mutation ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] .	18	82	sensitivity
In pretreated patients harboring a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , low expression of BRCA1 mRNA is correlated with a prolonged progression-free survival to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment .	21	5	resistance or non-response

Intriguingly , low expression of the NFκB inhibitor IκB was predictive of a poor clinical outcome in patients treated <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> without <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	19 20	22 23	resistance or non-response
Similar to the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , alteration of the drug contact residue T854 to a smaller hydrophobic alanine may increase the size of the selectivity pocket and negatively impact <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding .	30	4	resistance or non-response
Amplification of MET , a receptor tyrosine kinase , was detected in up to 20 % of lung cancer specimens that developed acquired resistance to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Although MET amplification can coexist with the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , approximately 60 % of MET amplification is independent of T790M mutation [ , ] .	27	37	resistance or non-response
Moreover , the second-generation irreversible EGFR inhibitors were shown in preclinical models to be more potent targeting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation than gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	22	17	resistance or non-response
Second-generation irreversible EGFR inhibitors , which bind irreversibly in the ATP binding pocket of EGFR through a covalent bond at C797 , were shown to be more potent inhibitors of the second-site <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib in pre-clinical models [ , ] ( ) .	35	32	resistance or non-response
However , in clinical studies , BIBW2992 did not prolong survival compared to placebo in NSCLC patients who have developed acquired resistance to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . Another agent in this class of next generation EGFR TKIs , PF-002999804 , inhibits all ERBB family members and has been shown to be effective against tumors harboring <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ , ] .	25	57	resistance or non-response
Moreover , dual inhibition of EGFR with an irreversible EGFR inhibitor ( afatinib ) and the EGFR neutralizing antibody cetuximab has recently shown promising activity in EGFR mutant lung cancers with acquired EGFR TKI resistance that harbor an EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] . Recently , a clinical trial was conducted to investigate whether there would be any additional clinical benefit with the addition of systemic chemotherapy to an EGFR TKI in lung cancer patients . In the subgroup of 66 patients with an EGFR mutation who received either single-agent <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or concurrent combination of chemotherapy and erlotinib , progression free survival was 15.7 and 17.2 months , respectively , in this trial .	90	39	resistance or non-response

The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation is not necessary for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance	8	1	resistance or non-response
Results of DNA Sanger sequencing of PCR products of exons 18–21 from H2170 and H358 parental and resistant cells showed no <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or D761Y resistance point mutations .	21 22	22 23	resistance or non-response
Resistant cells did not display either the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or D761Y mutations , suggesting the use of an alternative signaling mechanism to overcome <ANNO_TYPE_drug> susceptibility .	22	7	resistance or non-response
Thus , our results may apply to patients with acquired resistance to a combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and tivantinib , as our cells demonstrate decreased sensitivity to tivantinib . Previous studies have shown that an EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is the primary cause of resistance and many have focused on developing irreversible TKIs against EGFR that would prevent or maintain efficacy against the T790M mutation .	15	35	resistance or non-response
Targeting additional pathways other than EGFR in NSCLC patients has already been shown to be effective in clinical trials combining <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with tivantinib or MetMab , . Therefore , concurrent targeting of mTOR and Wnt pathways may further improve drug efficacy and prevent resistance . Furthermore , in the event that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation can be targeted by TKIs , additional pathways such as mTOR and Wnt may cause additional tumorigenicity even after downregulation of p-EGFR .	20	52	resistance or non-response
In studies where mutation types were reported individually the most common EGFR mutations were exon 19 deletions ( 53 % ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations ( 38 % ) . Characteristics of the studies included in the pooled analysis to evaluate the effects of single-agent <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , single-agent gefitinib or chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC ( studies not included in the original analysis are highlighted )	44	22	sensitivity
Furthermore , although common mutations , such as exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in exon 21 have been associated with response to EGFR TKIs , many other mutations are detected only occasionally , and correlations with response are not defined . A recent study screened 681 cases and found 18 rare mutations ; responses to EGFR TKIs were reported on a case by case basis and varied by mutation [ ] . For example , exon 20 and 21 mutations were more likely to confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib , while exon 18 and 19 mutations were more often associated with improved efficacy outcome .	88	12	sensitivity
Exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations have shown similar in vitro sensitivity to gefitinib [ ] ; however , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib have shown different clinical efficacy depending on whether exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations are present [ , ] .	19	4	sensitivity
EGFR TKIs ( gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and afatinib ) lead to responses in most patients with advanced NSCLCs harboring sensitizing EGFR activating mutations when given as first or further lines of treatment . It is important to note that the most predominant somatic mutations that were included in these trials were EGFR exon 19 deletions ( the most common is delE746_A750 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ; therefore , all current genomic based approvals for EGFR TKIs are limited to tumors with the aforementioned classic mutations .	5	64	sensitivity
One of the mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) was previously identified in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients and this mutation was found to increase sensitivity to EGFR inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	31	5	sensitivity
Appearance of the most frequent activating mutation – deletion of 15 nucleotides in codons 746-750 in exon 19 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution in exon 21 of the EGFR gene – is associated with permanent stimulation of the receptor , but they also lead to an increase in both efficiency of reversible EGFR TKI and effectiveness of radiotherapy . Activating mutations of the EGFR gene have been reported in only about 10 % of Caucasians patients with NSCLC , more often in non-smokers , women , and patients with adenocarcinoma . Therefore , the first studies on the efficacy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib in second-line treatment ( BR.21 , ISEL , INTEREST ) have shown that an objective response to EGFR TKI treatment occurs in less than 10 % of patients in the general population [ – ] .	99	19 20	sensitivity
In vitro studies demonstrated that the effective concentration of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in tumour cells harbouring both the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T790M mutations has to be 300 times higher to induce apoptosis than in cells only with an activating mutation in codon 858 [ , ] .	9	16	sensitivity
In case of occurrence of both <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T790M mutations , the concentration of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> should be three times higher in order to achieve a therapeutic effect .	14	6	sensitivity
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation leads to a substitution of threonine to methionine in the catalytic centre of EGFR tyrosine kinase , which is located in the binding pocket of TKI and ATP . Substitution of threonine at codon 790 into larger methionine probably results in blocking of the binding sites of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib aromatic residues with their point of action .	50	1	resistance or non-response

These patients were treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib . Activating mutations in EGFR were detected in cells obtained from primary tumour , circulating tumour cells in peripheral blood ( consistency of results – 92 % ) and in free circulating DNA ( consistency of results – 33 % ) . The authors also investigated presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in similar samples , and they detected cells harbouring that mutation in 10 patients ( n = 26 ; 38.5 % ) .	5	57	resistance or non-response
Presence of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution may be an indication for treatment with irreversible EGFR TKI , such as neratinib , keratinib and especially afatinib , which is currently in the third phase of clinical trials . The LUX-Lung 1 study has shown that afatinib induces an objective response and prolongation of progression-free survival ( PFS ) in NSCLC patients who have been previously treated with EGFR TKI for at least 12 weeks . The rationale for this type of study is the fact that afatinib has a different molecular structure when compared to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	94	2	resistance or non-response

Unfortunately , more than half of patients with MET gene amplification also presented the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the EGFR gene . Despite the lack of unequivocal efficacy , simultaneous inhibition of c-MET and EGFR function seems to be an attractive alternative therapeutic option in resistance to reversible EGFR TKI . There are ongoing second and third phase trials of the c-MET inhibitors tivantinib and PF-2341066 , used together with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients previously untreated with EGFR TKI or in case of progression after successful monotherapy with erlotinib [ , – ] .	69	14	resistance or non-response

Contrarily , a point mutation in the EGFR gene , which results in the substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , decreases the ability of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib to inhibit EGFR .	30	23	resistance or non-response
This alteration leads to increased affinity for ATP , which can then out-compete gefitinib and/or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for binding to the receptor . Irreversible inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase are currently in development that form permanent covalent bonds to the binding domain rather than having to compete with ATP for temporary interactions .

In the last decade , a series of RCTs have confirmed the non-inferior efficacy and relatively low toxicity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib in treatment naïve or previously treated NSCLC patients compared with the standard chemotherapy – . Meanwhile , pre planned or post-study biomarker analyses indicated that the presence of EGFR mutation , which mainly refers to deletions in exon 19 or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution in exon 21 , was the strongest predictor of efficacy for EGFR-TKIs .	19	63	sensitivity

Afatinib is considered as a second-generation TKI that binds irreversibly to EGFR as well as receptors carrying the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations , such as exon 19 deletion and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation , are found in a population of NSCLC , and are associated with a clinical response to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGF-TKIs ) , gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> – .	47	16	sensitivity
HGF induces resistance to irreversible EGFR-TKIs and mutant EGFR-selective TKIs , which were developed to overcome <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated EGFR-TKI resistance .

Both HGF and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutations are frequently detected in EGFR-TKI resistant tumors , where they contribute to resistance . Therefore , these observations illustrate the necessity of clinical trials with mTOR inhibitors in EGFR mutant lung cancer patients who become refractory to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	45	3	resistance or non-response
The Spanish Lung Cancer Group screened 2105 patients , to identify 350 patients ( 15 % ) with exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> of whom 250 patients went on to receive <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the first or second-line setting .	31	22	sensitivity
In the case of acquired resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in EGFR mutant tumors two major mechanisms have been identified .

Firstly , a secondary mutation , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation within exon 20 of EGFR , is responsible for about 50 % of instances of acquired resistance [ , ] .

T790M mutation in EGFR gene seems to be one of the most important genetic abnormalities involving the resistance for reversible epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases inhibitors ( EGFR-TKI ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib in NSCLC patients [ – ] .

Mechanism of achieving resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib remains unclear .

It is possible to conceive that an increase in the clinical doses of gefitinib or switching to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which is given at its maximal tolerated dose [ ] , may lead to beneficial clinical effects , possibly by increasing BIM expression , in patients with EGFR mutations who acquired L747S after exposure to gefitinib . The data presented here indicate that BIM is both a marker and an effector of TKI induced apoptosis in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells . Furthermore , we identified a novel acquired EGFR secondary mutation , L747S , and showed that both the L747S and the common T790M in cis to an activating EGFR mutation ( either <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or an exon 19 deletion ) cause resistance to EGFR TKI induced apoptosis and attenuate the up-regulation of BIM .	17	111	sensitivity

The clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) , such as gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , has been demonstrated in non–small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients in whom standard chemotherapy has failed. , Further studies have revealed that the presence of activating mutations in the EGFR kinase domain is strongly associated with the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-TKIs. , Randomized phase 3 trials have demonstrated that EGFR-TKIs significantly improve median progression-free survival ( PFS ) compared with platinum-doublet therapy in EGFR mutated patients.– However , not all mutations in the EGFR kinase domain are responsive to EGFR-TKI treatment . These phase 3 trials have shown that EGFR-TKIs are effective for patients with common EGFR mutations , such as an exon 19 deletion or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation , which account for more than 90 % of EGFR mutations .	18	128	sensitivity
A sixfold or 14-fold higher concentration of gefitinib was required to inhibit the growth of cells expressing G719X or L861Q , respectively , compared with cells expressing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .

The authors also examined the sensitivity of G719X and L861Q mutations to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and irreversible TKIs .	58	27	sensitivity
Because previous phase 3 trials that investigated <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or irreversible TKIs for NSCLC with EGFR mutations did not include uncommon EGFR mutations , further clinical studies may need to be performed. , , Another possible strategy for the treatment of uncommon EGFR mutations is the combination of EGFR-TKIs and cytotoxic agents . Our group has undertaken a randomized phase 3 trial to compare gefitinib plus carboplatin plus pemetrexed with gefitinib monotherapy for patients with NSCLC with an exon 19 deletion or an <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , G719X , or L861Q EGFR mutation ( NEJ009 ; University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry [ UMIN-CTR ] number , UMIN000006340 ) .	7	82	sensitivity

Furthermore , for the three dominant mutation types from our observed patients , namely <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , delE746_A750 and delL747_P753insS , we carry out a brief exploration in on the modeled mutant-inhibitor complex structures , with the WT-inhibitor system used for a comparison .	13	38	sensitivity
These systems each incorporate an EGFR kinase protein ( WT , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , delE746_A750 or delL747_P753insS ) and an inhibitor ( gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) .	23	11	sensitivity
For both inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , the binding free energies with these mutants scatter around that with the WT protein ( denoted by red lines ) . Especially , for mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> that is a common cause of lung cancer , the binding free energy of the mutant with an inhibitor ( marked with solid blue circles ) is lower than that of the WT protein .	5	32	sensitivity
Accordingly , parts ( c ) to ( g ) show the mutation types <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , delL747_P753insS , dulH773 , delE746_A750 , and T854A_L858R respectively . Parts ( h ) and ( i ) display the inhibitor binding pocket of mutant delE746_A750 with inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> respectively .	46	14	sensitivity
Diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) show the plots for trajectory ( frames ) vs. backbone RMSD ( Å ) in the MD simulation period ( 2 ns ) , with regard to the solvated WT-gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> systems respectively . Similarly , diagrams ( c ) ~ ( d ) , ( e ) ~ ( f ) and ( g ) ~ ( h ) present the plots for the systems involving <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , delE746_A750 and delL747_P753insS respectively .	39	76	sensitivity
Parts ( b ) and ( d ) present the distributions of total binding free energies of the mutants ( with WT protein included ) with two inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The red lines and solid blue circles show the binding free energy for the WT EGFR and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant respectively .	30	50	sensitivity
CO-1686 is a third-generation EGFR TKI , which may be more effective in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . NCT01526928 is an ongoing phase I/II trial that has enrolled patients who have failed prior chemotherapy and EGFR targeted therapy including <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , gefitinib , neratinib , afatinib , or dacomitinib .	38	15	resistance or non-response
EGFR mutations are divided into two groups of drug resistant and drug sensitive mutations ( the drugs are <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib ) . More than 90 % of mutations are drug sensitive , 45 % of which are in exon 19 and 40–45 % occur in exon 21 . Two of the most common mutations are Δ747-P753 that arises in exon 19 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and take place in exon 21 , .	18	62 63	sensitivity
Similar to gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> also inhibited the growth of H1819 and HCC827 cell lines ( IC50 5.0 and 0.010 micromol/L , respectively ) but did not affect the H1299 cells ( IC50 50.0 micromol/L ) . Amann et al. reported that IC50 of TKIs showed a more closely correlation with the inhibition of ERK and Akt phosphorylation and also pointed that inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity by means of gefitinib inhibits downstream STAT3 activity . In H3255 cells with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , Haura et al. found that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition by TKI leads to complete inhibition of pSTAT3 .	4	81	sensitivity
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> second mutation accounts for half of all resistances to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	13	1	resistance or non-response
However , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation may exist in only a small fraction of tumor cells before drug treatment , and the tumor cells harboring this mutation may be enriched over time during treatment with gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	36	3	resistance or non-response
Exon 19 deletion mutation and a mutation in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) are the two main types of EGFR mutation . Riely et al found that patients with the EGFR exon 19 mutation had a longer median survival time than those with the EGFR exon 21 mutation after receiving gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 34 versus 8 months , respectively ; P=0.01 , log-rank ) .	52	11	sensitivity
Patients had to have been treated with either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib in the study . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> had to have been evaluated in the primary lung-cancer tissue of patients before EGFR TKI treatment , without limitation to the detection methods .	8	15	resistance or non-response
Second-generation TKIs that irreversibly inhibit the EGFR TKI domain may offer the potential for overcoming the resistance of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib .	21	18	resistance or non-response
In particular , epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) , such as gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , have been developed as a novel treatment option for patients with non–small cell lung cancers ( NSCLCs ) that possess somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene – . Prospective clinical trials of EGFR-TKI treatment in NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations , such as delE746-A750 ( exon 19 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( exon 21 ) , have demonstrated high clinical response rates of approximately 80 % – .	18	79	sensitivity
All of the patients had the EGFR gene mutations in exon 19 ( delE746-A750 ) or exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , and had received or were receiving gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for treatment against advanced diseases at the blood sampling .	30	19	sensitivity
All of the patients had the EGFR gene mutations in exon 19 ( delE746-A750 ) or exon 21 ( L858R ) , and had received or were receiving gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for treatment against advanced diseases at the blood sampling . For analysis of EGFR gene mutations in exon 19 ( delE746-A750 ) or exon 21 ( L858R ) , the peptic nucleic acid locked nucleic acid ( PNA-LNA ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) clamp method was adopted , using protocols described previously . The EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was examined in cell-free DNA obtained from plasma of the patients , since no biopsy specimens for DNA analysis could be obtained because of difficult accessibility of tumors during or after EGFR-TKI-treatment .	30	88	resistance or non-response
At the same time , a secondary point mutation in exon 20 of EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is associated with acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors , including <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	27	15	resistance or non-response
For example , detecting the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in blood samples would be useful for patient selection for treatment with new EGFR-TKIs for lung cancers that are resistant to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	30	5	resistance or non-response
The majority of mutations that have been associated with sensitivity to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are located in exon 19 ( 45 % ) and exon 21 ( 40–45 % ) , although ~5 % are located in exon 18 and & lt ; 1 % in exon 20 [ ] . In addition , certain mutations in exon 20 , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , predict resistance to these TKIs [ ] .	13	62	resistance or non-response
Activating mutations such as exon 21 missense point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and in-frame deletions in exon 19 are the most commonly studied predictive biomarkers of response to EGFR-TKIs ( gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) , .	30	9	sensitivity
Activating mutations such as exon 21 missense point mutation L858R and in-frame deletions in exon 19 are the most commonly studied predictive biomarkers of response to EGFR-TKIs ( gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) , . Development of resistance to TKI is a thorny problem in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treatment . Despite the initial promising response to EGFR-TKIs in majority of NSCLC patients harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations , , most patients eventually relapse due to the emergence of acquired resistance such as the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or MET amplification , both accounting for about 70 % of the acquired resistance .	30	86	resistance or non-response
Approximately 50 % of EGFR mutations consist of deletions in exon 19 , whereas 35–45 % consist of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and 5 % consist of insertions in exon 20 or the L861Q mutation – . Gefitinib ( Iressa ) and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Tarceva ) are EGFR inhibitors that are used clinically for the treatment of advanced NSCLC , primarily that with EGFR mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains – .	41	18 19	sensitivity

Gefitinib ( Iressa ) and Erlotinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) are EGFR inhibitors that are used clinically for the treatment of advanced NSCLC , primarily that with EGFR mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains – .	43	18 19	sensitivity
Clinical responsiveness to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in NSCLC have been shown to correlate with somatic mutations in the EGFR gene , which result in increased sensitivity to inhibition of growth by the drugs [ , - ] . EGFR mutations have been found more frequently in non smoking East Asian women with adenocarcinoma with bronchioalvelar features [ , - ] . A protocol based on mutant enriched PCR followed by primer extension of the PCR products was used to detect EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in NSCLC [ ] .	5	81	resistance or non-response
Studies support that some of these activating mutations are not only reliable predictors of response to the small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> but also prognostic factors for survival [ - ] . Among numerous TK domain mutations , 85–90 % are exon 19 E746_A750 deletions or exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutations [ ] .	28	54 55	sensitivity
The studies that established the relationship between mutations in the EGFR gene and response to the small molecule EGFR TKIs gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were done using analysis of DNA extracted from the tumor [ ] . The recent availability of antibodies that are specific for the mutations most clearly associated with response to EGFR TKIs , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and E746_A750del , create the opportunity to exploit an alternative method to evaluate NSCLC for EGFR mutations to aid decisions with regard to EGFR TKI therapy [ ] .	22	56	sensitivity
It is well known that the efficacy of targeted therapies such as gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with NSCLC patients depends on the presence of EGFR activating mutations including in-frame deletion in exon 19 or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 [ – ] .	14	33	sensitivity

It is well known that the efficacy of targeted therapies such as gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with NSCLC patients depends on the presence of EGFR activating mutations including in-frame deletion in exon 19 or L858R in exon 21 [ – ] . However , many patients acquire resistance to EGFR-TKI , which occurs within 9.5 to 14 months [ – ] . A second EGFR mutation , substitution of threonine 790 with methionine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , was detected in approximately 50 % of the patients who had acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI [ ] .	14	73	resistance or non-response

However , all of the patients received systemic chemotherapy prior to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy , and the original lung tissue was obtained long before epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors were used . We describe a chemonaive patient with gefitinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma harboring <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	13	44	sensitivity
Gefitinib responsiveness results in large part from the drug 's effective inhibition of essential antiapoptotic signals transduced by the mutant receptor , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is the most commonly detected mutation [ ] . The T790M mutation is rarely found in tumors from patients not treated with either gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and could be discovered only in progressing tumors , in addition to a primary drug-sensitive mutation in EGFR .	49	23	sensitivity
A non-small-cell lung cancer cell line bearing both T790M and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations was approximately 100-fold less sensitive to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and did not show inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro [ ] .	20	10	sensitivity
The research article by Pao et al. [ ] provides important new information addressing three patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in progressing tumors containing a secondary mutation , leading to the substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 20 .	22	43	resistance or non-response

Pao et al. and Kobayashi et al. identified four cases with lung adenocarcinoma harboring pre existing mutations of EGFR as delL747–E749 plus A750P , delE746–A750 , or delL747–S752 , prior to the use of gefitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] . All of them had exposure to previous systemic chemotherapies and took a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor as the second- or third-line therapy , then all acquired a second mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in the following months after disease progression .	35 36	70	resistance or non-response
In particular , epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) , such as gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , demonstrated marked clinical activity against NSCLC harboring an activating EGFR mutation ( – ) . Additionally , some reports suggest that the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation may not be rare and may exist in a small population of in tumor cells before TKI treatment ( – ) .	17	42	resistance or non-response
Somatic mutation of EGFR defines a specific subclass of lung adenocarcinomas with sensitivity to treatment with the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ - ] . The two major classes of EGFR mutations are an <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation and small , in-frame deletions in exon 19 ; both types of mutation enhance the activity and oncogenicity of EGFR compared to the wild-type protein [ ] .	21	35	sensitivity
In addition , the presence of common activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene ( exon 19 deletion and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ) confers strong sensitivity to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which are selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR [ , ] .	38	29	sensitivity
This event is analogous to replacement of threonine 790 with methionine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> lung adenocarcinoma .	15	12	resistance or non-response

Our biological model of sensitive and resistant cells consisted of two NSCLC cell lines , HCC827 and H1975 , with different sensitivities to the EGFR inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ) The HCC827 cell line harbors a mutation in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain ( E746–A750 ) that renders these cells sensitive to EGFR TKI therapies , whereas the H1975 cells harbor both <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T790M mutations and are resistant to EGFR TKIs .	26	61 62	sensitivity
In this paper , we utilized mathematical modeling in conjunction with quantitative in vitro experiments to identify optimal combination treatment strategies using <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and paclitaxel to prevent or delay resistance to treatment in NSCLC cells . We used an integrative approach to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of a tumor , which are determined by the composition of , and interactions between , sensitive and resistant cells in the presence of treatment . Although several mechanisms of resistance to EGFR TKIs ( e.g. , MET amplification ) have been identified , we focused on addressing the penetrance of preexisting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> harboring resistant cells in NSCLC since this mechanism of resistance remains a major clinical problem .	22	98	resistance or non-response
Our biological model of sensitive and resistant cells consisted of two NSCLC cell lines , HCC827 and H1975 , with different sensitivities to the EGFR inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ) The HCC827 cell line harbors a mutation in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain ( E746–A750 ) that renders these cells sensitive to EGFR TKI therapies , whereas the H1975 cells harbor both the L858R <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations and are resistant to EGFR TKIs .	26	63 64	resistance or non-response
This behavior is consistent with clinical observations in which 100 % of patients who initially respond to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> develop acquired resistance , often mediated by a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	17	26	resistance or non-response
Somatic mutations included two different EGFR mutations : an activating mutation in a dominant tumor clone as well as a second <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation present in an <ANNO_TYPE_drug> subclone .	26	21	resistance or non-response
The mechanistic reasons behind the resistance to EGFR TKI are different , probably involving <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation and MET amplification . Recently , some irreversible EGFR-TKIs and MET inhibitors have shown antitumour activity in patients resistant to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in pre-clinical studies ( ; ; ; ; ) .	39	14	resistance or non-response
Deletion in exon 19 , which removes the conserved sequence LREA , and a single point mutation in exon 21 , which leads to the substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , are the most clinically relevant and extensively studied drug-sensitive mutations [ ] . Studies have shown that these mutations preferentially bind to first generation EGFR-TKIs , gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] .	65	34	sensitivity
In this study , we report that BMS-690514 has in vivo efficacy on a panel of NSLCC xenografts , including those with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations , conferring resistance to EGFR therapies such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or Gefitinib .	32	22	resistance or non-response

Further , they represented a SQCLC patient with a wild type EGFR who showed radiological response after treatment with both dasatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in their clinical trial . The patient was confirmed to have a new mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the DDR2 kinase domain .	22	38	response
Moreover , interactions between <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and MYO2 or MYH9 have been described , and a MYH9 inhibitor synergizes with EGFR inhibitors to induce apoptosis in cells carrying the drug-resistant mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	4	30	resistance or non-response
Kim and colleagues demonstrated that the combination of lapatinib with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> overcame gefitinib resistance due to the secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in NSCLC by inducing enhanced cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo [ ] .	10	18	response 
Furthermore , the association of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with afatinib has been shown to be effective to overcome <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated drug resistance [ ] .	5	16	response

Ba/F3 cells expressing the colon-cancer derived G724S mutant and the lung/colon cancer derived <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant showed sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with an IC50 value of ~ 0.3 μg/ml ( Figure	18	13	sensitivity

Given that colon cancer derived <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G724S mutants are sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , we sought to examine whether oncogenic potential of these mutants are dependent on the asymmetric dimerization like lung cancer derived L858R mutant .	12	5	sensitivity
To test the hypothesis that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G724S mutants is a function of their dimerization dependence , we generated G719S and G724S mutants with compound substitution mutations at the dimerization interface in the N-lobe or C-lobe that disrupt the asymmetric dimerization of EGFR [ ] .	5	8	sensitivity
Dimerization impairing cis mutations in EGFR , L704N and I941R , significantly reduced the ability of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G724S mutants to promote colony formation upon retroviral transduction ( Figure	17	18	sensitivity
Taken together , these data suggest that colon cancer derived <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G724S mutants acquire their oncogenic potentials following asymmetric dimerization , respectively , which are similar to lung-cancer derived L858R mutant [ ] .	10	11	sensitivity
Furthermore , these results are consistent with our model that EGFR variants that are dependent on dimerization can be inhibited by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Dimerization disruption has effects on the transforming activity of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G724S EGFR proteins .	21	32	sensitivity

Furthermore , these results are consistent with our model that EGFR variants that are dependent on dimerization can be inhibited by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Dimerization disruption has effects on the transforming activity of G719S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR proteins .	21	34	sensitivity

Given their resistance to lapatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , there appears to be little rationale for the use of these agents in non-small cell lung cancer containing L858R and Δ746–750 EGFR mutations whereas erlotinib’s clinical benefit in these cases is readily understood .

Because mutations in the KRAS gene result in activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway , only metastatic colorectal cancer patients with wild-type KRAS tumors qualify for anti-EGFR targeted therapies with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab [ ] .

Mutational analysis is helpful in detecting the development of secondary mutations in tumors that are responding poorly to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and in identifying the PDGFRA exon 18 codon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutation , which is associated with a good prognosis , but conversely confers resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , Exon 9 is reported to benefit from a high dose ( 800 mg/day ) of imatinib in some studies .	46	29	resistance or non-response

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> has been found to be effective not only for GIST with C-KIT mutations but also for GIST with PDGFRA mutations and for wild-type GISTs. , However , no adjuvant treatment is recommended in GISTs with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutation in the PDGFRA exon 18 , which are known to be unresponsive to imatinib and showed very favorable outcome after surgery .	0	37	resistance or non-response

Hence , Gleevac is shown to benefit virtually all patients with metastatic GIST regardless of the mutational status of the tumor ; however , patients with particular GIST mutations on exon 18 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) are resistant to Gleevac .

The 2 patients with mutations in PDGFRA had them in exon 18 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or exon 12 . The small series does not permit any conclusive considerations on the correlation of DMD involvement with KIT/PDGFRA kinase genotype . But as the clinical use of sunitinib and regorafenib after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> failure does not completely cover the molecular landscape of the progressing GIST , a novel approach that targets dystrophin deregulation may have relevance in GIST treatment .	47	12	resistance or non-response
T790M mutation occurs by substitution of the amino acid threonine by methionine in amino acid position 790 ( T790M ) on exon 20 and is similar to the KIT <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutation observed in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> gastrointestinal stromal tumor .	34	29	resistance 
The cause of refractoriness has been identified in ca. 15 % of mCRC patients as mutations in the BRAF gene , primarily <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution . Raf family proteins are downstream of Ras proteins in the signal transduction pathway originating at EGFR . It comes as no surprise , then , that activating mutations in the BRAF gene occurring in cancer cells have a similar clinical effect to KRAS gene mutations , making them refractory both to cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , , – ] .	78	22	resistance or non-response
Notably , the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention ( EGAPP ) Working Group ( EWG ) found insufficient evidence to recommend or discourage testing for mutations in BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , NRAS , or PIK3CA and/or loss of PTEN or AKT protein . Therefore , the EWG discourages the use of these tests for deciding whether to introduce anti-EGFR therapy with cetuximab or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> until more evidence supports improved clinical outcomes [ ] .	65	31	resistance or non-response
Multiple analyses have demonstrated that responses to either cetuximab or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> occur exclusively within the 60–70 % of patients without activating mutations in codon 12 and 13 of KRAS [ , , , ] . The activating <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutation is present in an additional 10 % of patients , and it may be predictive of a lack of response to anti-EGFR therapy [ ] in addition to a clear poor prognostic factor .	10	37	resistance or non-response

In addition , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> should be active in patients with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and in those with HER2 amplification , representing 60 % –70 % of the resistant population .	3	11	response 
Indeed , a recent preclinical study shows how in the presence of acquired MET amplification and HGF overexpression , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> monotherapy is unable to inhibit the growth of cells that were originally sensitive to first-generation EGFR TKIs . Eight patients enrolled in the study were known to harbor a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation on archival tissue collected at diagnosis , but authors provided no information on the outcome of these patients .	19	49	response 
The rationale of the combination lies in some preclinical work in which mice with EGFR mutated lung cancer and acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs showed tumor regression under treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and cetuximab . In the clinical trial , results from the first 96 evaluable patients showed impressive objective response rate ( ORR ) and disease control rate ( DCR ; 30 % and 75 % , respectively ) . Response to treatment was observed both in patients bearing a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or other mechanisms of resistance .	30	80	response 
In particular , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> should be used in patients with classical mutations in the EGFR gene ( exon 19 deletions and exon 21 point mutations ) and could be considered in the presence of G719X and L861Q mutations . Patients with exon 20 insertions and de novo <ANNO_TYPE_variant> should best be treated with chemotherapy or included in clinical trials with novel agents .	3	47	response 
Patients with exon 20 insertions and de novo <ANNO_TYPE_variant> should best be treated with chemotherapy or included in clinical trials with novel agents . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> also showed some activity in patients with EGFR mutations who are resistant to both chemotherapy and reversible TKIs , but the study that sought to address this question has several biases that reduce the strength of its results .	24	8	response 
Tumor sections from the combined treatment group exhibited lower levels of EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> expression accompanied by higher caspase-3 protein expression levels compared with sections from the control group ( , middle and lower panel ) . Tumor tissues were also evaluated for EGFR expression and downstream signaling . The results showed that the combination of cDzT and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> further suppressed total EGFR expression , the phosphorylation of EGFR in tumor tissues , and the levels of the phosphorylated forms of STAT3 , AKT , and ERK compared with the control group ( ) .	57	12	sensitivity
Combined therapy with DzT and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> synergistically inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors derived from cells harboring the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , suggesting that DzT may overcome T790M based TKI resistance in NSCLC .	5	19	response 
Synergistic antitumor effect of combined treatment with cDzT and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in vitro and in vivo cDzT could be used as single agent or as part of combination therapy with second generation TKIs to increase efficacy in the treatment of NSCLCs that harbor the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	9	44	response

In vitro studies showed that exposing EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines to a mutagen and culturing them in the presence of an EGFR-TKI , the resistant clones with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation maintained a persistent phosphorylation [ ] . Given this role of persistent EGFR signaling , many trials evaluated the intensification of EGFR inhibition through the use of drug molecules with additional activity against other receptors in the EGFR family , as the second-generation neratinib , dacomitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	78	29	response

Although <ANNO_TYPE_drug> combination showed promising results , current data do not justify its use outside clinical trials . Targeting a specific alteration of the EGFR downstreamingsignalling Recently , investigators have identified covalent pyrimidine EGFR inhibitors , which are 30–100 fold more potent than quinazoline based EGFR inhibitors against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells , and up to 100 fold less potent against wild type EGFR cells , as CO-1686 and AP26113 [ ] .	1	48 49	response

In vitro studies and some case reports have shown that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is effective ( cell apoptosis and disease stabilisation ) in cells harbouring the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in NSCLC patients [ , – ] .	10	24	response 
EGFR TKI , which are effective for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of the EGFR gene , may also prove to be effective in patients with mutations in exon 20 of the HER2 gene , but only if they have the ability to block the function of the tyrosine kinase associated with both EGFR and HER2 . A double reversible inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 receptors called lapatinib has not shown efficacy in this case . However , irreversible inhibitors , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and neratinib , which additionally have a likely inhibition effect on the HER4 tyrosine kinase , may be effective in the case of mutations in both genes .	81	8	response 
In vitro studies have shown that these drugs exhibit activity against cells with the wild-type or mutated ( with activating mutation ) form of the EGFR gene , as well as against cells which are resistant to them because of the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the EGFR gene and insertion- deletion changes in the HER2 gene . However , in the case of wild-type EGFR and mutations which cause resistance to drugs , the concentration of agents required to effectively induce apoptosis in tumour cells may exceed the tolerated dose level in therapy . Currently , it is known that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which is in the most advanced trials , is effective in some patients who have benefited from pre-treatment with reversible EGFR TKI .	102	44	response

An interesting aspect is that BCR/ABL TK inhibitors , when applied in combination , may produce antileukemic effects on CML cells exhibiting BCR/ABL <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , even if leukemic cells are resistant against single agents ( ; ) . Whether combinations of TK inhibitors will also induce long lasting remission in ( all ) patients with TK-inhibitor resistant CML , remains at present unknown . An important therapeutic consideration is prevention of occurrence ( selection ) of subclones carrying <ANNO_TYPE_drug> BCR/ABL mutants .	78	23	None
Both drugs are registered and approved for treatment of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CML . The decision to introduce such therapy should be based on a thorough investigation for BCR/ABL mutations , as treatment will fail when CML cells display the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	9	38	None

Our findings are consistent with these observations and suggest that nilotinib is highly active in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or -intolerant CML-CP/AP . We detected 5 BCR-ABL mutations ( M244V , F317L , N358D , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and E459K ) in 6 patients at baseline screening .	17	34	None
Thus , we sequenced the respective regions of PIK3CA ( database number ENST000000263967 ) in all <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cell lines .

PDGFR-beta was observed to be hyperphosphorylated in the cells from one B-Raf inhibitor-resistant line , but surprisingly the cells were not sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> which can target PDGFR-beta . Other studies have indicated that switching of Raf isoforms may confer resistance to B-Raf inhibitors . Switching from B-Raf to either Raf-1 or A-Raf was observed after incubation of melanoma cells containing the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the presence of the B-Raf inhibitor dabrafenib for prolonged periods of time in the recovered inhibitor-resistant cells .	23	63	None
Survival for CML-CP patients with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation treated with TKIs is estimated to be reduced by 50 % compared with patients without the T315I mutation ( median survival of 22 months vs. more than 10 years for TKI-responsive CML patients ; Nicolini et al. , 2009 ) . Additionally , omacetaxine has been shown to potentiate the effects of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and nilotinib by overcoming cytokine rescue of BCR-ABL–positive leukemic cells thought to be mediated primarily by interleukin-3 ( Allan , Holyoake , Craig , & amp ; Jorgensen , 2011 ; Klag et al. , 2012 ) , offering promising new options for combination therapies .	61	6	None

In our retrospective study , 26.7 % of patients , all with KRAS wild-type tumours , who had previously unresectable liver-only metastases , underwent surgical resection after systemic therapy , with R0 resection achieved in 38 patients ( 21.6 % ) ; one of those was patient with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Although it is difficult to make any comparison , because our patients were not selected according to specific systemic therapy , these results are comparable with those reported in previous studies claiming that 19 to 23 % patients treated with bevacizumab- and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based chemotherapy and with previously unresectable liver-only metastases underwent resection.– In a recently published clinical study BOXER , where the patients with unresectable liver-only metastases were treated with oxaliplatin , capecitabine and bevacizumab , R0 resection was achieved in 40 % of patients .	95	50	None

We further collected PBMCs from six Ph+ ALL patients at diagnosis ( Table S1 in File S1 ) , which due to the small overall sample size available were only used for experiments with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Although not included in later computations , this experiment provides an appreciation of the degree of similarity between target profiles from cell lines and Ph+ ALL patients .

We generated <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , M39L and M44L mutants of procaspase-3-D3A , respectively , and assayed the purified mutants for caspase-3 activity before and after PDT . Before PDT , the D3A-M27L and D3A-M39L mutants displayed activities comparable to that of procaspase-3-D3A . These observations suggest that oxidation of multiple Met residues could contribute to the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mediated oxidative regulation of caspase-3 activity .	55	2	None
To determine whether MED13/13L bound to FBW7 , immunoprecipitation assays were conducted which showed that MED13/13L co-precipitated with FBW7 after proteasomal inhibition either by its inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or by using dominant-negative-Cullin1 .

EGFR TKI , which are effective for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of the EGFR gene , may also prove to be effective in patients with mutations in exon 20 of the HER2 gene , but only if they have the ability to block the function of the tyrosine kinase associated with both EGFR and HER2 . A double reversible inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 receptors called <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has not shown efficacy in this case .	65	8	None
In addition , they showed that two dominant activating mutations in the PI3K catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PI3K-CA ) , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and H1047R , which are prevalent in breast cancer , also confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	36	21	None

To test whether GBM cells influence the p53 expression of astrocytes , conditioned medium from <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and U87MG cells were collected after 48 h , as described previously . Cerebral cortex astrocytes from newborn wild-type mice were then cultured in these serum-free conditioned media ( CM ) or in fresh serum-free culture medium ( control ; CTL ) , in the presence or absence of 1 μM of the DNA damaging <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( VP-16 ) for 24 h .	71 72	15	None
Validating the regulation of additional lncRNAs by <ANNO_TYPE_variant> as well as elucidating the role ( s ) such lncRNAs play in E2F1 mediated biological functions awaits future research . Clearly , further characterization of those potential lncRNAs will increase our understanding of how lncRNAs are integrated into the E2F-regulatory network . The biological function ( s ) of lncRNAs are only now beginning to be elucidated ; we show here that inhibition of ERIC expression augments E2F1 induced as well as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced apoptosis ( Figure , ) , suggesting that ERIC has an inhibitory effect on apoptosis in these settings .	81	7	None
We also observed that BC was able to sensitize A549 and H157 cells to sublethal doses of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , doxorubicin , or staurosporine again in an additive or synergistic manner ( Additional File , Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	17	35	None
In agreement with these observations , the quantitation ( B ) of an immunoblot analysis of endogenous caspase 9 in F9-overexpressing versus control cells after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or UV irradiation ( Supplementary Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) showed a more substantial increase in the former ( B ) .	25	32	None
All analyses were conducted using the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell line . This particular cell line was chosen because it is less sensitive to BCNU ( bis-chloroethylnitrosourea ; carmustine ) and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than the U87-MG cell line [ ] .	29	6	None

Interestingly , while the corresponding non replicating AdE1A12S , AdE1A1102 and AdE1A1108 also potently enhanced mitoxantrone- and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced cell killing , the AdE1A1104 mutant did not sensitize any cells . Binding of cellular factors to specific amino acid motifs in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> have previously been elegantly demonstrated by numerous researchers , therefore , we did not perform additional binding assays in this study ( reviewed in , ) .	17	41	None
In this study we screened a panel of replicating mutants with small E1A-deletions previously demonstrated to be defective in binding to pRb ( dl1108 , dl922–947 ) , p300 and p400 ( dl1101 ) , p300/CBP ( dl1104 ) , and p400 and p21 ( dl1102 ) , , , , , to explore whether the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gene regions that bind to these and other cellular factors are essential for sensitization to drugs currently used in the clinic for prostate cancer : mitoxantrone , a topoisomerase inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , a microtubule interfering drug .	89 90	56 57	None
Thus , based both on previous clinical reports , ,, and our experience of this case , through widely used methods , we inferred that the pretreatment <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was associated with shorter progression-free survival after EGFR–TKI therapy . Since 2000 , several large-scale clinical trials have been conducted to determine the standard chemotherapy regimen for the second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC that has relapsed or progressed after platinum based <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> monotherapy was the first US Food and Drug Administration approved chemotherapy regimen for this disease entity. , Furthermore , both pemetrexed and docetaxel were recommended as standard second-line treatments for advanced NSCLC since 2004 .	70 71	27	None

Very recently , sophisticated GEMM models of lung cancer were used to evaluate responsiveness to combined therapy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and the MEK inhibitor selumetinib ( AZD6244 ) , according to a co-clinical trial effort [ ] . Co-clinical trials aim to anticipate , in suitable GEMMs , the results of concomitant human clinical trials , as well as to provide a rationale in the elaboration of clinically relevant hypotheses , useful for design of corresponding studies in human cancer [ , ] . In this model , the KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> activating mutation was associated either to TP53 or LKB1 loss in lung epithelium , to parallel selected human NSCLC cases harboring both oncogene activation ( KRAS ) and oncosuppressor ( TP53 or LKB1 ) loss .	18	89	None
In this model , the KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> activating mutation was associated either to TP53 or LKB1 loss in lung epithelium , to parallel selected human NSCLC cases harboring both oncogene activation ( KRAS ) and oncosuppressor ( TP53 or LKB1 ) loss . The latter were obtained via nasal instillation of adenoviruses expressing CRE recombinase in the appropriate genetic models . The study showed that the combination therapy with selumetinib was more effective than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> alone in K-Ras and K-Ras/p53 mice , while K-Ras/Lkb1 mice where showing primary resistance to the combination therapy .	74	6	None
After this diagnosis , the patient received the three courses of first-line chemotherapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> plus carboplatin as stage IV ( T4N0M1 ) with lung-to-lung metastasis . Thus , the patient began to take gefitinib at 250 mg/day because EGFR gene analysis in this patient showed a deletion mutation in exon 19 and point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 by direct sequence method ( ) .	14	55	None
And pyridoxal has been discovered as a potent antagonist of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> purinergic receptor , which accelerates repair of the skin barrier and prevents epithelial hyperplasia .

In a cohort of 309 patients from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study ( AOCS ) , we found three common single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in ABCB1 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( rs1128503 ) , G2677T/A ( rs2032582 ) and C3435T ( rs1045642 ) ) were associated with significant differences in progression-free survival ( PFS ) for the subgroup of women with ≤ 1 cm residual disease who received paclitaxel and carboplatin first-line chemotherapy . In this subgroup of patients , PFS was significantly longer for individuals who carried the minor T/A alleles at the 2677G&gt;T/A compared with homozygote GG carriers ( HZ = 0.61 , 95 % CI 0.45–0.83 ; p = 0.002 ) . A similar effect was demonstrated in 281 patients from Scottish Randomised Trial in Ovarian Cancer 1 ( SCOTROC1 ) who had no residual disease after surgery and received carboplatin and paclitaxel or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> combination chemotherapy .	147	29	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> was purchased from Sigma , St. Louis , MO and Dasatinib was purchased from Santacruz biotechnology , ( Dallas , TX ) . Transfections Human PC3 cells were transiently transfected with either SiRNA-GSK-3 ( Santacruz biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) using oligofectamine ( Life technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) or cSrc constructs for CA-Src ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and DN-Src ( K259R ) , and Akt constructs for CA-Akt ( myr-Akt ) and DN-Akt ( Akt-K179M ) using lipofectamine 2000 ( Life technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) as transfection reagents according to the manufacturer 's protocol .	0	58	None
One of these trials has already been published ( ) , another ( comparing dose dense FE75C followed by paclitaxel vs FE75C followed by docetaxel in node positive patients ) has been submitted for presentation in the upcoming SABCS 2012 , whereas the two other studies ( one in node positive patients comparing dose dense docetaxel followed by FE75C vs docetaxel/cyclophosphamide and one in node negative patients comparing <ANNO_TYPE_drug> followed by epirubicin vs docetaxel plus epirubicin ) are not yet mature for final analysis . The remaining patients ( almost 40 % ) were treated out of protocol with FE75C or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> chemotherapy .	68	101	None
A randomised , open-label phase III trial ( INTEREST ) of gefitinib versus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in previously treated patients established non-inferior survival in patients treated with TKIs compared with chemotherapy , thus suggesting that gefitinib is a valid treatment for pre treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer . In contrast to the significant clinical and radiological responses seen in patients harbouring EGFR activating mutations , gefitinib and erlotinib have shown only limited activity in non-EGFR genotyped , or unselected , NSCLCs when given as first , second or subsequent lines of therapy. , . This has been reported by several prospective trials of gefitinib and erlotinib in EGFR mutated NSCLC , which showed RRs exceeding 70 % in tumors with exon 19 deletions or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , with PFS intervals of 6-14 months and OS times beyond 20-24 months- .	13	124	None
An EGFR mutation test with this specimen using the peptide nucleic acid ( PNA ) clamping method , revealed two mutations in exon 21 ( L858R/L861Q ) and exon 20 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( ) .

A non-redundant gene list was compiled from the following sources : genes previously seen to be regulated by sagopilone or paclitaxel ( Hammer et al. , ; Winsel et al. , ) , genes previously described as predictors for paclitaxel and/or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity ( Bergstralh and Ting , ; Potti et al. , ; Swanton et al. , ) , genes reported in CIN signatures ( Kim et al. , ) , and genes with the following gene ontology annotations : drug transport , drug metabolism , tubulin , SAC , cell cycle control , or microtubule associated proteins ( http : //www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA ) . The relative expression of 792 genes was analyzed in the three breast cancer cell lines MCF7 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and MDA-MB-435s and the lung cancer cell line A549 in the in-house Array Northern database based on results from by Affymetrix HGU133Plus2.0 arrays , and only genes with significant expression in at least two of the four cell lines were retained .	41	122	None
Furthermore , a high response rate ( 60 to 90 % ) to treatment with EGFR-TKIs has been observed in patients harboring mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR , with exon 19 deletions and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutations comprising about 90 % of all mutations [ , ] . Although the mechanism of lethal interstitial pneumonia as a side effect of EGFR-TKI is still unknown , EGFR-TKI can be striking in cancer reduction and quality of life improvement in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR gene mutations . Currently , EGFR-TKI is considered third-line chemotherapy for patients with inoperable and recurrent NSCLC after first-line platinum based combination chemotherapy and second-line chemotherapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ; however , in future the combination of cytotoxic agents and EGFR-TKI may become first- or second-line standard chemotherapy .	120	43	None
In a study of 62 patients with non-small cell lung cancer that were being treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and cisplatin , there was an association between the synonymous <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism in ERCC and median survival time and time to progression .	16	27	None
On the other hand , erlotinib could not inhibit EGFR phosphorylation in H1975 cells because the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR causes a conformation change at the ATP binding pocket , thus decreasing the affinity between erlotinib and EGFR . Since all of the erlotinib-resistant cell lines express EGFR , we examined the antitumor effect of combination therapy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with erlotinib or irinotecan .	58	16	None
Gefitinib is also approved as monotherapy for EGFR mutation positive NSCLC following failure of platinum- and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based chemotherapy . The second-generation irreversible EGFR TKI afatinib recently gained FDA approval as first-line therapy for EGFR mutation positive NSCLC in conjunction with Qiagen 's therascreen RGQ polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) diagnostic test . Another second-generation irreversible EGFR TKI , dacomitinib , demonstrated preclinical efficacy in NSCLC tumours harbouring the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutation , , which is present in ∼50 % of NSCLCs that have acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib , .	16	70	None

Although recent meta-analysis and a multi-center study reported no association between K-ras mutations and CRC patients’ prognosis could not be indicated , the largest study focused on this issue , the RASCAL collaborative study , showed there might be connections <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and poorer prognosis [ - ] . Similar relationship was also indicated by our preliminary research , which suggested that the presence of a K-ras mutation might lead to a lower CRC survival rate [ ] . Current clinical trials verified that K-ras gene mutations were related to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in mCRC ( metastatic colorectal cancer ) patients [ ] .	91	40 41	None
This was confirmed in vitro , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated cancer cells were resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , whereas G13D mutated and KRAS wild-type cancer cells were sensitive .	14	7	None
Analysis of the cell-free tumor DNA samples at PD in patient 1 and 2 showed the presence of the KRAS mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> while in patient 3 the G12D mutation was detected . Interestingly , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cell-free tumor DNA was positive for KRAS mutant alleles for patients 2 and 3 , but was not sufficient to test the mutational status of KRAS in patient 1 .	34	21	None
A recent study demonstrated that using a combination of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> reversed the drug resistance in NSCLC in T790M and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation lung cancer cell lines ( Wang et al. , ) .	11	21	None
Doody and colleagues studied the activity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with NSCLC lines bearing both wild-type EGFR and those with activating mutations in the intracellular kinase domain : not only those known to confer sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and delL747-T753insS ) but also the TKI-resistant mutation T790M .	7	38	None
The authors concluded that the FCGR3A <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism is a significant independent predictor of overall survival . However , a retrospective analysis published by Paez et al. concluded that FcgR genotype was not useful in predicting response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab ( an anti-EGFR mAb ) in patients with advanced colorectal cancer [ ] .	38	6	None
These findings may explain why the monoclonal antibody <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has little effect on lung cancer cells with activating mutations , but seems to inhibit other tumors ( such as colorectal carcinomas ) that overexpress wild-type EGFR . While all of the mutant forms tested demonstrated transforming activity , they showed marked differences in their responses to TKIs . As previously demonstrated [ , , ] , cells with the deletion mutant and the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> were inhibited by the TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib , while the exon 20 insertion mutation was resistant .	8	75	None
However , compared with WT tEGFR , the oncogenic mutant tEGFRs showed similar potencies regardless of EGF or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ligand . In contrast to the behavior of erlotinib , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and Δ746–750 tEGFR forms were highly resistant to lapatinib with apparent Kis in the range of 2–6 µM .	18	30	None
These observations are the basis for a number of ongoing clinical trials which are exploring the role of monoclonal antibodies against EGFR such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib in triple negative breast cancer . Many mutations in the EGFR gene have been reported in NSCLC but only a few have been validated , either from in vitro studies or from tumour responses in NSCLC patients , to be associated with responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase drugs [ , ] . These mutations are usually found in exons 18 , 19 , 20 and 21 , and include missense substitutions such as G719A/S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and deletions like E746 to A750 ( removal of amino acids Glucine-Leucine-Arginine-Glucine-Alanine ( ELREA ) ) which are associated with sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors [ , ] .	24	108	None
The presence of the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant has also been found to be associated with significantly improved progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) in 32 EGFR positive mCRC patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in combination with irinotecan [ ] .	36	5	None
Combinations of therapy such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> plus erlotinib and gefitinib plus everolimus have also been tried . The most promising drug thus far has been afatinib ( BIBW2992 ; Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma , Ingelheim , Germany ) , , an ErbB family blocker with reported in vitro and in vivo activity against EGFR mutant tumors harboring exon 19 deletions , exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations and the exon 20 T790M “resistance” mutations .	5	61	None
The fact that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment caused an upregulation of SphK1 expression in UD-SCC-5 cells strongly indicates a functional link between EGFR and SphK1 : It is known that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> can transactivate several RTKs , including EGFR [ ] and that the transactivation of EGFR involves S1P-3 , Src , and MMP [ ] .	3	28	None
Cells of the colorectal cancer line HT-29 have a mutated BRAF gene ( V600E ) and are relatively resistant to cytotoxicity by anti-EGFR antibody <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . We found that HT-29 cells also had a mutation in the PIK3CA gene ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	24	40	None

For example , breast cancer patients with amplification/overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 2 ( HER-2 ) are selectively sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and Lapatinib ( Stern , ) , melanomas harboring BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations to Vemurafenib ( Flaherty et al. , ) , non-small cells lung cancers ( NSCLC ) with mutated EGFR to Erlotinib and Gefitinib ( Pallis et al. , ) , and KIT and PDGFRA mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST ) to Imatinib ( Antonescu , ) .	24	35	None
This is exemplified by the emergence of resistance mechanisms such as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutation in NSCLC [ ] .

The kinase domains of wild-type human c-Abl ( residues 229–512 ) and wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> human c-Src ( residues 254–536 ) were expressed in E.coli BL21 ( DE3 ) ( Invitrogen ) and purified by affinity , ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography as previously described . Extensive previous work has demonstrated that Abl expressed in bacteria is correctly folded and retains catalytic activity , , , . Samples of the Abl : bosutinib and Abl : bosutinib isomer complexes were prepared by mixing Abl kinase domain ( in sample buffer : 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT ) with a three-fold excess of bosutinib ( Tocris Bioscience ) or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> isomer ( LC Labs ) in DMSO and performing buffer exchange with sample buffer to remove the DMSO and unbound drug .	117	13 14	None
While <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , like the three currently approved inhibitors of BCR-Abl , is inactive against the common <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , our results suggest that the related 4-anilinoquinazolines are not affected by this mutation , and might yield an effective remedy for this form of BCR-Abl .	1	17	None
In an in vitro study of the effect of imatinib resistance mutations on inhibition by dasatinib , nilotinib and bosutinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was not affected by either the Q252H or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations , consistent with the lack of interactions between bosutinib and the P-loop .	21	30	None

Studies comparing dasatinib , nilotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to imatinib in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML are underway.– , If durable cytogenetic response rates are significantly improved with the use of these medications in the front line setting , it is possible that a smaller percentage of patients will ultimately develop treatment resistance . Lastly , new small molecule non-ATP-competitive inhibitors designed to address the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation are under development .	6	64	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> is based on a quinolone scaffold and is related to AstraZeneca quinazoline template and it also had the ability of inhibiting mutation of T3151 [ ] .

In our case , a favorable prognosis was expected because of solitary metastasis and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation [ ] . We tried to treat our patient with second-line chemotherapy [ <ANNO_TYPE_drug> + pemetrexed + bevacizumab ( AUC 6 + 500 mg/m2 + 15 mg/kg ) ] and its maintenance chemotherapy ( pemetrexed + bevacizumab ) .	30	14	None
Of note , according to our case , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> + pemetrexed + bevacizumab and its maintenance chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated for solitary breast metastasis from a lung adenocarcinoma which is resistant to gefitinib and possesses the secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the EGFR gene .	8	39	None
Furthermore , the biopsy of the breast metastasis revealed the second mutation of resistance to gefitinib in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .

Resistance mechanisms to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are multiple , and include ALK-dominant mechanisms such as resistance mutations and copy number gain , and ALK non-dominant mechanisms through the outgrowth of clones containing a separate activated oncogene . In contrast to the EGFR setting , where the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation predominates , the spectrum of ALK resistance mutations is broad .	3	44	None
We also detected KRAS mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or G12A ) in two SLC34A2-ROS1–positive patients , with coexistence of ROS1 rearrangement and KRAS mutation not having been previously described . Further studies are warranted to investigate whether the overlap between these oncogenes is clinically relevant and might affect the choice of optimal therapy . We have previously shown that inhibition of MET signaling either with the small-molecule MET and ALK inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or by RNA interference targeted to MET mRNA resulted in marked antitumor effects in MET amplification–positive NSCLC cell lines both in vitro and in vivo ( 21 ) .	70	6	None
Patients with EGFR mutations have shown a positive response to therapy with erlotinib , although many of these patients relapse later , frequently due to a secondary EGFR mutation , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .

Some studies have suggested that low ERCC1 expression is associated with increased chemotherapeutic sensitivity and thus considered a predictive marker for patients with colorectal cancer receiving combination oxaliplatin and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> chemotherapy , while other studies indicated that genetic variants in ERCC2 were associated with the increased risk of early relapse in colorectal cancer . Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , as important genetic biomarkers , have been reported to be related with altered gene expression and protein activity . Several SNPs of ERCC1 and ERCC2 have been identified , of which ERCC1 rs11615 and rs3212986 SNPs ( Asn118Asn and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) have some effects on ERCC1 mRNA expression , whereas ERCC2 rs1799793 ( Asp312Asn ) and rs13181 ( Lys751Gln ) SNPs are associated with suboptimal DNA repair capacity .	29	100	None

Thus , the patient began to take gefitinib at 250 mg/day because EGFR gene analysis in this patient showed a deletion mutation in exon 19 and point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 by direct sequence method ( ) . The tumor size of right middle lobe and lower lobe was decreasing , and the metastatic nodules of both upper lobes had nearly disappeared . Although gefitinib was discontinued because the disease had progressed , the patient with a good performance status received 2 courses of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and 4 sequential courses of gemcitabine/vinorelbine chemotherapy ( ) .	85	28	None
Thus far , results have been promising in this latter trial , with disease control reported in the first 26 patients , including 36 % with partial responses and four out of 13 responses in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated patients . Patient focused perspectives Preliminary results from LUX-Lung 3 comparing afatinib versus cisplatin and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as first-line treatment in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma demonstrate a statistically significant delay in onset of cough ( HR 0.60 ) and dyspnea ( HR 0.68 ) with afatinib treatment .	52	35	None
Later tumor analysis revealed arginine-for-leucine substitution at amino acid 858 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the EGFR kinase domain . Combination chemotherapy consisting of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , carboplatin , and bevacizumab was administered at the same dosage and schedule as .	23	11	None
In addition , there were no statistical differences in the response rates among patients with classical mutations , exon 19 deletion and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations , and non-classical mutations .

The LUX-LUNG 3 study [ ] , a multicenter , randomized , open-label phase III study compared afatinib with cisplatin plus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients with lung adenocarcinoma , stage IIIb/IV harboring EGFR mutations [ , ] . Among the 1,269 screened patients , 345 resulted eligible and were randomized in a two-to-one fashion to afatinib 40 mg daily or chemotherapy up to a maximum of six cycles ( without any maintenance therapy ) . As expected , patients were mainly East Asian , never-smokers and women ; EGFR mutations were predominantly exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutations .	21	95	None
For example , large phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that ADC is a strong predictive factor for improved outcome following treatment with the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with cisplatin compared with SQC [ ] . In addition , the presence of common activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene ( exon 19 deletion and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ) confers strong sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib , which are selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR [ , ] .	26	64	None
In patients with metastatic melanoma featuring BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) have shown response rates of more than 50 % [ ] .	23	7	None
The discovery of activating mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the BRAF kinase encouraged the development of compounds to inhibit aberrant BRAF activity [ ] . Vemurafenib ( also known as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , RG7204 , or RO5185426 ) marketed as Zelboraf is a BRAF enzyme inhibitor developed by Plexxikon ( Berkeley , CA , USA , now part of the Daiichi Sankyo Group ) and Roche [ ] .	30	6	None
Specifically , in colorectal cancer , more than 95 % of the B-Raf mutations that have been found in colorectal cancer are <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations [ , ] .

The first selective BRAF inhibitor to enter clinical trials was vemurafenib ( also designated <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , PLX4720 , and RG7204 ) . Vemurafenib was developed alongside a companion real-time polymerase chain reaction based assay ( cobas® 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test ; Roche Molecular Diagnostics , Inc , Pleasanton , CA ) designed to detect the BRAFV600E mutation . This test is highly sensitive and specific for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutation but is less so for other V600 BRAF mutations ( eg , V600K , V600R , V600D , or the 1799_1800TG & gt ; AA V600E mutation ) .–	14	68	None
The best validated targeted drugs in melanoma are the selective BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , Zelboraf™ ) and dabrafenib ( GSK2118436 , Tafinlar™ ) as well as the LGX818 ( Novartis ) compound that appears to have the highest affinity for the catalytic domain of the kinase . All of them are relatively selective for their intended target <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF , with little cross-reactivity for wild-type BRAF and CRAF .	14	59	None
This consists of BRAF mutational analysis at <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and MLH1 promoter methylation , both of which are associated with sporadic CRC [ , ] .

A number of effective EGFR-specific therapeutic compounds against NSCLC , with EGFR activating mutations ( exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutations ) , have been developed and approved for clinical use . These include both small molecule ( i.e. Erlotinib and Gefitinib ) and antibody ( i.e. Cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) inhibitors .	50	19	None
Forty-five patients were treated with cetuximab , five with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The genotypic frequencies of FcgRIIIA and FcgRIIa detected within the analyzed population were 36 % VV , 54 % VF ,10 % FF and 36 % HH , 56 % HR , 8 % RR , respectively . The χ2 test showed that there were no significant differences in the genotype frequencies ( p=0.109 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ; p=0.183 for FcgRIIa ) between patients and healthy controls .	9	65 66	None
In 2009 the FDa updated the registration labels for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and cetuximab , specifying that they are approved for the treatment of CRC tumors expressing wild-type KRaS . This was indeed a milestone in the way toward the development of personalized EGFR targeted therapies . another case of successful use of a biomarker has been the assessment of activating EGFR mutations in NSCLC ( for example , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , which predicts response to STKIs .	9	67	None
FDA approved EGFR targeted inhibitors include the low-molecular-weight ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors , such as gefitinib and erlotinib , and humanized monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain , notably cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . Although high-level expression of EGFR ligands and/or increased EGFR gene copy numbers may be predictive markers for antitumor response by cetuximab in colon cancer [ - ] , and patients with RAS driven cancers are known not to benefit from cetuximab treatment , a clear molecular explanation of cancer response to cetuximab has remained elusive . Genomic studies identify <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant in colorectal carcinomas	31	94	None
The study included a correlated serological and histopathological substudy in order to characterize the tumor microenvironment and pre- and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> immunological modifications . Ipilimumab’s mechanism of action and pattern of time response , with typically rare objective responses and long-term disease stabilization , make it less effective for neoadjuvant use , where a higher response rate and rapid tumor shrinking are critical . In this sense , BRAF inhibitors seem to be ideal candidates because of their prompt , repeatedly confirmed response in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma .	19	83	None

However , the decision about starting treatment with a B-RAF inhibitor is based on the individual clinical scenario , and many patients whose tumors harbor <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations may initiate treatment with other therapies such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or IL-2 .	35	25	None
His tumor was found to harbor the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , and he was started on vemurafenib 720 mg orally twice daily , with weekly monitoring due to his ongoing hemodialysis . Restaging PET/CT scan in July 2012 showed a partial response to therapy with a decrease in size of some of the lesions , as well as a reduced standardized uptake value . He was started on immunotherapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and received four doses of ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg over 12 weeks .	70	8	None
In 2011 , two agents , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4 to promote antitumor immunity ) and vemurafenib ( a potent inhibitor of mutated <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF ) were approved in Europe and the US for the treatment of metastatic melanoma .	6	29	None
Although the discovery of BRAF gene mutation and the advancement of immunotherapy in melanoma have led to the development of highly effective targeted therapy such as vemurafenib , dabrafenib , and trametinib and durable immunotherapy such as interleukin-2 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , the efficacy of these treatments in metastatic mucosal melanoma is not clear due to limited number of these patients included in clinical trials . Recently , several clinical trials reported promising results with targeting of CKIT mutation in mucosal melanoma [ - ] . CKIT mutations are reported in 21 % of mucosal melanoma , and only patients with mucosal melanoma harboring a special subset of CKIT mutations such as L576P and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 11 and 13 may have a clinical benefit from c-KIT inhibitors [ ] .	39	113	None
Patients with KIT exon 9 mutant tumors achieve a better response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , than those with exon 11 mutations .

LRRK2-IN-1 treatment resulted in the relocalization of the wild-type , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and R1441C to more fibrillar-like structures similar to what was reported previously , . Interestingly , the localization of kinase dead D1994A was not affected by LRRK2-IN-1 ( ) . Similar localization results were observed for HEK293T , SH-SY5Y cells and primary human astrocytes and for treatment with other LRRK2 inhibitors such as H-1152 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( data not shown ) .	66	10	None
These inhibitors—imatinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , nilotinib , and dasatanib—were developed for different cancers ( chronic myeloid leukemia , gastrointestinal stromal tumors ) and different kinases , but they showed activity against KIT .

Whether the survival difference between BRAF WT and mutant patients is only due to the fact that BRAF mutational status has prognostic value or if BRAF mutational status may also be predictive for a combination treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and temozolomide can not be concluded definitively from our data set , but should be prospectively studied . If the 2 most frequent BRAF mutations , V600E and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , are the alterations with predictive value in melanoma patients , techniques identical or similar to method 1 described in this paper may be the detection system of choice .	37	66	None
Of these , the everolimus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> combination is the only one where both drugs are tolerated at full dose , has promising activity , and has now reached randomized phase II testing compared to the established IFN-bevacizumab regimen in the first-line setting ( RECORD-2 study ) .

It is also possible to speculate that low levels of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients with hypogonadism induced by hyperprolactinemia may contribute to the development of pituitary adenomas and resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> agonist treatment .	10	29	None
Moreover , some studies suggest that alterations in the proportion of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D2S isoform expression could be involved in D2R agonist resistance , , . In addition , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitize anterior pituitary cells to different proapoptotic stimuli , , and we have observed that CAB induces apoptosis of lactotropes only when cells are cultured in the presence of E2 , making it plausible that the hormonal milieu could affect the action of D2R agonists in patients with prolactinomas .	29	11	None

One of the most critical mechanisms for acquired resistance is the gatekeeper EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutation , which is found in approximately 49 % –63 % of patients who have developed resistance to EGFR inhibitors. , Preliminary studies also indicate that the T790M mutation may play a crucial role in primary resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors because of clonal evolution in tumor cells with preexisting T790M mutations . Different strategies have been pursued in the management of progressive disease after treatment with first-generation EGFR TKIs , including monotherapies such as dasatinib and neratinib , as well as the rational combinations of cetuximab plus erlotinib and of erlotinib/gefitinib plus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	108	13	None
Rapamycin and rapalogs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , temsirolimus ) can slow the proliferation of cancer cell lines and have achieved some success in specific malignancies [ , ] . Unfortunately , however , their overall efficacy as cancer therapeutics has been limited . The major drawbacks of rapalogs are : 1 ) <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is exquisitely inhibited , yet the control of 4EBP and mRNA translation is far less sensitive [ , ] ; 2 ) TORC2 activity is not acutely blocked ( though it can be suppressed upon sustained exposure [ ] ) ; 3 ) the loss of a feedback inhibition pathway mediated by S6K results in amplified PI3K signaling , with potential to amplify RAS , MAPK , and TORC2 itself [ - ] .	4	51	None
In the case of combined treatment this doxorubicin induced Akt phosphorylation may not be overcome by everolimus at the concentration used and may counteract the antitumor activity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , as suggested by the higher expression of phospho Akt of the combination group compared to the everolimus treated one . In the chondrosarcoma model the activity of the mTOR pathway in response to the different treatments was monitored by following activation levels of 4EBP1 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> as potential surrogate markers of tumor response .	28	75	None
