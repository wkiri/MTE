Two patients with classic activating mutations exhibited de novo <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance and had concurrent genetic anomalies usually associated with acquired TKI resistance , specifically the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutation and MET amplification .	9	25	resistance or non-response
The point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> of the EGFR gene and MET amplification are known to be involved in the majority of cases of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	25	3	resistance or non-response
The most common mutations are exon 19 deletions and exon 21 point mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , which can be found in approximately 10 % –20 % of NSCLC patients , more frequently in never smokers , women , Asians and with adenocarcinoma.– These alterations in structure of the self phosphorylating domain enhance EGFR activation and also favor binding of TKIs to their site of action . Patients who harbor these mutations experience response rates higher than 65 % and median survival of 20–30 months , as demonstrated in several retrospective studies.– Such results led investigators to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as a first-line therapy in EGFR mutated patients in prospective trials .	97 98	14	sensitivity
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> has shown measurable efficacy at early stage of treatment , but patients become insensitive to this drug after 6 to 9 months , which finally leads to treatment failure [ ] . Several resistance mechanisms , such as EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation that leads to a higher ATP binding capacity , and MET amplification resulting in an aberrantly activated alternative pathway that bypasses the inhibited EGF receptors , had been discovered .	0	40	resistance or non-response
First , a secondary mutation in exon 20 , leading to a substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the kinase domain , is reported in 2 of 5 patients with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] .	39	21	resistance or non-response
The appearance of a second mutation represents a mechanism of resistance : in fact the authors demonstrate that the insertion of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> into test cells renders them resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in vitro .	29	21	resistance or non-response
Preliminary data were recently published that show that this agent has clinical activity in 2 patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations and acquired <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance [ ] . Finally , a recent retrospective analysis of IDEAL trial specimens does not find any <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in the tumours analysed [ ] .	24	43	resistance or non-response
Mutations in the EGFR TK domain are found mostly in subjects who respond to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , as reported in the first three studies conducted in 2004 [ – ] . The same mutations are more frequent in women , in adenocarcinoma , in non-smokers and in Japanese subjects , all with a statistical significance [ ] . These were clustered in exons 18 , 19 and 21 and were either small in-frame deletion ( 746–750 , adjacent to K745 : ELREA aminoacids ) or heterozygous missense mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> adjacent to the DFG motif in the COOH-terminal lobe in the activation loop of the kinase ) around the ATP binding pocket .	14	88 89	sensitivity

Pooled data from these three studies show that 25 of 31 ( 81 % ) patients with partial response or marked clinical improvement have an EGFR mutation , vs. none of 29 specimens from refractory patients ( p=0.0001 ) . Several other studies investigate the role of these mutations in the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR TK inhibitors , demonstrating a statistically significant correlation between the response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib and the presence of the biological data , but this correspondence is not always 100 % [ – ] ( Table ) .	124	31 32	sensitivity
A specific mutation ( del746–750 ) is found to be superior to other <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) mutations for the prediction of response <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	22 23	13 14	sensitivity
Finally , a recent study shows not only that EGFR mutations are statistically associated with Asian ethnicity and never-smoker status , but also that patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions have significantly longer median survival than patients with EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( 34 vs. 8 months , p=0.01 ) after treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] .	52	39	sensitivity
Three cell lines also had a second mutation , either <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance associated mutation in exon 20 ( n = 2 ) or homozygous deletion of the PTEN gene . Contradictory data are available for the gender for the patient from whom the PC-9 cell line was originated – the surgeon informed us that the patient was female while the distributing institution states that it was from a male ( personal communication from Dr. Harubumi Kato , Tokyo Medical University , Japan ) . Cell lines considered resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( IC50 & gt ; 1 µM ) are indicated in red .	89	10	resistance or non-response
Seven of these cell lines were sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The three resistant lines had a second mutation : either the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance associated mutation in exon 20 ( n = 2 ) or a homozygous deletion of the PTEN gene and absence of its protein ( authors ' unpublished observations ) .	8	21	resistance or non-response
Of the remaining EGFR mutant cell lines , two had <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( one intermediate and one resistant ) and one had a homozygous deletion of PTEN ( resistant ) . KRAS mutant and wild type cell lines were all resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	42	10	resistance or non-response
The resistant cell line category was the largest and included two mEGFR cell lines , one having the secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and the other having homozygous deletion of PTEN gene . The remaining resistant lines included all of the wild type lines and all lines having KRAS , BRAF , HER2 , HER4 and PIK3CA mutations . Using univariate tests , we analyzed the association between <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity and mutational status or CNGs of the various EGFR pathway genes and found a significant correlation between gefitinib sensitivity with EGFR mutation ( p = 0.002 ) and EGFR copy number gains ( p = 0.001 ) .	66	19	resistance or non-response

Depending on the previously determined in vitro threshold for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and the bimodal curve we classified our NSCLC cell lines into 3 categories : sensitive , intermediate and resistant . We had nine sensitive cell lines which included seven of the 10 EGFR mutant cell lines , one cell line with EGFR CNG and one with HER2 CNG . Of the remaining 3 EGFR mutant cell lines , two had the resistance associated secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	9	74	resistance or non-response
21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> T790M 2.8 25.0 26 shows the clinico-pathologic and molecular data for the 10 NSCLC cell lines , which harbor EGFR mutations . These cell lines are arranged in decreasing order of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity .	33	1	sensitivity

When investigating the relevance of these features to our own population of lung cancer patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , our study detected all of these features occurring both independently and coincidentally in microdissected tumour cells . Tumours from four of thirty-eight patients contained a form of the exon 19 L747-A750 deletion and one tumour harboured the exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation .	17	58	sensitivity
Tumours from four of thirty-eight patients contained a form of the exon 19 L747-A750 deletion and one tumour harboured the exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation .

Pietanza et al. [ ] Phase II XL647 41 patients with relapsed or recurrent advanced NSCLC who progressed after ≥ 12 weeks of stable disease or response to erlotinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and/or those patients with a documented <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> Objective RR The objective RR was 3 % , 67 % of the patients harbored T790M had progression of disease , while14 % of those without this mutation , 11 patients ( 28 % ) had a dose reduction due to toxicity .	29 30	37 38	resistance or non-response
Specifically , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> concentrations were increased stepwise from 1 to 100 nM when cells resumed growth kinetics that were similar to untreated parental cells . Acquired resistance by genetic alterations , such as the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or amplified MET , were caused by the stepwise escalation method of EGFR-TKI exposure after prolonged treatment , .	2	35	resistance or non-response
This type of resistant cell with stem cell features was observed only after exposure to high concentrations of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , whereas the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or MET amplification were found after the stepwise escalation method .	18	23	resistance or non-response
At the molecular level , most patients with partial or complete responses to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib harbored specific mutations in the gene that encodes EGFR , located on chromosome 7p12 [ ] . Exon 19 mutations , characterized by in-frame deletions of amino-acids 747–750 , account for 45 % of mutations , exon 21 mutations , resulting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitutions , account for 40–45 % of mutations , and the remaining 10 % of mutations involve exon 18 and 20 [ - ] .	13	57 58	sensitivity
Erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> belong to the first generation of TKIs and have reversible binding features . The principal predictive factor for response to such drugs is the presence of somatic “activating” mutations in the EGFR gene that cause an aberrant and constitutive activation of the receptor at the membrane level , resulting in a growth advantage of tumor cells through the activation of Ras/MAPK , PI3K/Akt , and STAT signaling pathways . In about 50 % of cases , a secondary mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is supposed to be responsible for resistance. , Other mechanisms involve MET gene amplification ( 5 % –20 % ) ,	2	83	resistance or non-response
Compared to erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , afatinib shows lower EC50 values and greater potency against wild type ( afatinib vs erlotinib vs gefitinib : 60 nM vs 110 nM vs 157 nM ) and L858R mutated EGFR ( afatinib vs erlotinib vs gefitinib : 0.7 nM vs 40 nM vs 5 nM ) .

Eight patients enrolled in the study were known to harbor a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation on archival tissue collected at diagnosis , but authors provided no information on the outcome of these patients . It is likely that better selection on the basis of EGFR mutational status and acquired resistance mechanism would have translated into positive results also for the principal end point ( OS ) .

In br.21 , when only exon 19 deletion and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations were considered , the difference in response rate as compared with wild-type EGFR or other mutations was significant ( 27 % vs. 7 % , p = 0.035 ) . The subset analysis of tumour samples from the intact 1 and 2 trials evaluating the addition of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to standard first-line chemotherapies demonstrated that patients whose tumours had an EGFR mutation had a higher response to chemotherapy plus gefitinib than did those without a mutation ( n = 170 : 72 % vs. 55 % , p = 0.2 ) .	58	9	sensitivity

Somatic mutations in the EGFR gene have been identified as a major determinant of the clinical response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , in patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Most of the EGFR mutations occur in exons 19 to 21 , which encode the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor . Deletions in exon 19 ( such as delE746-A750 ) and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in exon 21 are the commonest mutations found in NSCLC , accounting for about 90 % of all EGFR mutations .	30	78	sensitivity
Log-rank test revealed that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment significantly prolonged PFS ( A ) , but not OS ( B ) , in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations . Significant differences in PFS ( C ) , but not in OS ( D ) , between patients with and without EGFR mutations were also apparent for mutations in both EGFR exon 19 ( E746-A750del ) and exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	4	67	sensitivity
To examine whether IgG titers against each of the 60 different peptides were associated with EGFR mutation status , their median values were compared among patients with EGFR mutations ( delE746-A750 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and the wild-type EGFR using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test . PFS was calculated from the date of initiation of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment until either the date of disease progression or the date of last contact .	53	32	sensitivity
Thirty-eight patients ( 90 % ) had adenocarcinoma , 34 ( 81 % ) had a good performance status ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 ) , and 15 ( 36 % ) received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as first-line chemotherapy . With regard to the type of EGFR mutation , 8 patients ( 19 % ) had deletions in exon 19 , 13 ( 31 % ) had the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutation in exon 21 , and 21 ( 50 % ) had the wild-type EGFR .	34	67	sensitivity
The cell line H1975 has a sensitizing L858R kinase domain mutation in exon 21 , but also a second mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , in cis , in the kinase domain ) rendering them resistant to the reversible TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib [ ] .	38	21	resistance or non-response

Ramalingam et al. [ ] used a combination of cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for patients with advanced/metastatic lung cancer who were previously treated with platinum based chemotherapy . It was concluded that dual inhibition is feasible and safe , and may have modest activity in advanced/metastatic NSCLC . The combination of afatinib and cetuximab can even overcome resistance due to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation both preclinically [ ] as well as clinically [ ] .	11	60	resistance or non-response
The cell line H1975 has a sensitizing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> kinase domain mutation in exon 21 , but also a second mutation ( T790M , in cis , in the kinase domain ) rendering them resistant to the reversible TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib [ ] .	38	7	sensitivity

The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation leads to a substitution of threonine to methionine in the catalytic centre of EGFR tyrosine kinase , which is located in the binding pocket of TKI and ATP . Substitution of threonine at codon 790 into larger methionine probably results in blocking of the binding sites of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> aromatic residues with their point of action .	52	1	resistance or non-response
Substitution of threonine at codon 790 into larger methionine probably results in blocking of the binding sites of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> aromatic residues with their point of action . In vitro studies demonstrated that the effective concentration of erlotinib in tumour cells harbouring both the L858R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations has to be 300 times higher to induce apoptosis than in cells only with an activating mutation in codon 858 [ , ] .	20	47	resistance or non-response
These patients were treated with erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Activating mutations in EGFR were detected in cells obtained from primary tumour , circulating tumour cells in peripheral blood ( consistency of results – 92 % ) and in free circulating DNA ( consistency of results – 33 % ) . The authors also investigated presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in similar samples , and they detected cells harbouring that mutation in 10 patients ( n = 26 ; 38.5 % ) .	7	57	resistance or non-response
Presence of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution may be an indication for treatment with irreversible EGFR TKI , such as neratinib , keratinib and especially afatinib , which is currently in the third phase of clinical trials . The LUX-Lung 1 study has shown that afatinib induces an objective response and prolongation of progression-free survival ( PFS ) in NSCLC patients who have been previously treated with EGFR TKI for at least 12 weeks . The rationale for this type of study is the fact that afatinib has a different molecular structure when compared to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib .	92	2	resistance or non-response
Inhibition of phosphorylation by EGFR tyrosine kinase in tumour cells after afatinib exposure remains active for 48 hours ( after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> only 8 hours ) , and phosphorylation activity of the kinase after that time ranges from 50 to 70 % of the primary activity . In vitro studies and some case reports have shown that afatinib is effective ( cell apoptosis and disease stabilisation ) in cells harbouring the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in NSCLC patients [ , – ] .	20	70	resistance or non-response
Appearance of the most frequent activating mutation – deletion of 15 nucleotides in codons 746-750 in exon 19 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution in exon 21 of the EGFR gene – is associated with permanent stimulation of the receptor , but they also lead to an increase in both efficiency of reversible EGFR TKI and effectiveness of radiotherapy . Activating mutations of the EGFR gene have been reported in only about 10 % of Caucasians patients with NSCLC , more often in non-smokers , women , and patients with adenocarcinoma . Therefore , the first studies on the efficacy of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in second-line treatment ( BR.21 , ISEL , INTEREST ) have shown that an objective response to EGFR TKI treatment occurs in less than 10 % of patients in the general population [ – ] .	101	19 20	sensitivity
Substitution of threonine at codon 790 into larger methionine probably results in blocking of the binding sites of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> aromatic residues with their point of action .

These results suggest that the addition of CX-4945 to EGFR-TKI may overcome <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance through the increased activity of EGFR-TKI to suppress EGFR signals by the down-regulation of EGFR . 10.1371/journal.pone.0114000.g004Addition of CX-4945 to EGFR-TKIs substantially suppressed the EGFR signaling pathway in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , PC-9 cells .	43	12	resistance or non-response

Since the introduction of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , patients with metastatic EGFR positive lung cancer can be offered a therapeutic alternative that has proven its superiority over standard platinum based chemotherapy , . In the EURTAC study , in which erlotinib was compared with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC , erlotinib demonstrated a significant improvement in the overall response rate ( ORR ) and median progression free survival ( PFS ) .

Whereas reversible EGFR TKIs compete with ATP in the kinase domain of EGFR , 2nd generation EGFR TKIs , also compete for ATP binding but then covalently bind at the edge of the ATP binding cleft on Cys773 of EGFR via the Michael mechanism ( addition of nucleophile to an α , β unsaturated carbonyl ) .

Lazzara and colleagues found that SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation was not induced in response to EGF in the H3255 cells , which harbor the missense <ANNO_TYPE_variant> exon 21 mutation , suggesting that SHP2 activity may be less efficiently promoted by EGFR L858R and the STAT3 pathway may be more active . The main problem is that STAT3 activation is not abrogated by single EGFR TKI treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , afatinib or dacomitinib , - .	66	24	sensitivity

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( OSI-774 , Tarceva ; OSI Pharmaceuticals/Genentech , New York , NY , USA ) , is an oral small-molecule inhibitor that binds to the kinase domain of EGFR and was approved for the treatment of NSCLC in 2004 .

In addition , previous reports showed the presence of signaling cross-activation between MET and EGFR in both A549 and H1975 cells , and both the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of EGFR and c-Met amplification are known mechanisms of acquired gefitinib ( TKI ) resistance in lung cancer . As c-Met has a critical role in NSCLC , co-treatment with a c-Met inhibitor plus a reversible or irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitor ( i.e. , to achieve dual c-Met /EGFR inhibition ) may represent an alternative strategy to circumvent T790M-EGFR mediated resistance in lung cancer .

Both focus on the two predominant EGFR mutations , the deletion in exon 19 and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation , and they will look at the T790M point mutation as a potential predictor of response to combination treatment . The T790M mutation is known to mediate secondary resistance to EGFR TKIs [ ] , yet there is evidence that it can be detected even before treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib when a high sensitivity method of detection is applied [ ] .	67	16	sensitivity

More than 50 % of lung adenocarcinomas (LAD) from East Asian non-smokers harbor EGFR mutations , and these tumors have been termed oncogene addicted to reflect their dependence on EGFR mediated pro-survival signaling and their high susceptibility to apoptosis induced by EGFR-TKIs ( e.g. gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) ( ) . The most frequently occurring mutations in the EGFR gene ( in-frame deletion in exon 19 at codons 746–750 or a single-base <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 ) predict an improved clinical response to first-line oral EGFR-TKIs compared with standard platinum based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) ( , ) .	46	72 73	sensitivity

EGFR TKIs ( such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib ) are selective inhibitors of EGFR 's kinase domain that work by competing with ATP for binding at the ATP binding site , thereby preventing autophosphorylation and activation . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation affects the gatekeeper residue in the catalytic kinase domain and confers drug resistance by increasing EGFR 's affinity for ATP – thus reducing the potency of the ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors .	5	38	resistance or non-response
A second therapeutic strategy thus adds various drugs or antibodies capable of inhibiting c-MET ( e.g. crizotinib , foretinib , ARQ 197 , MetMAb ) to first- ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) or second- ( PF-00299804 ) generation EGFR-TKIs , , . c-MET is a proto-oncogene that encodes a protein known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) that possesses tyrosine-kinase activity .

In 2004 , EGFR gene mutations were firstly identified : classical activating EGFR mutations are localized in exon 19 , mainly consisting of an in-frame deletion ( 45-50 % ) , and in exon 21 , consisting of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation ( 40-45 % ) , even if there are less common mutations localized in other exons [ – ] . Since their identification , it was clear that EGFR mutations , more frequently observed in never smokers , adenocarcinoma histology , women and Asiatic patients , outline a distinct subgroup of NSCLC . During the last years , six phase III trials ( Table ) established that patients harboring activating EGFR mutations benefit more from a first line treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib , than from standard chemotherapy , at least in terms of response rate ( RR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) and quality of life [ – ] .	133	39	sensitivity
The firstly described and the most common event responsible for resistance is the acquisition of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutation , which is found in ≈ 50 % of patients progressing after an initial response <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib [ , ] .	34 35	16	resistance or non-response
In vitro studies showed that exposing EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines to a mutagen and culturing them in the presence of an EGFR-TKI , the resistant clones with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation maintained a persistent phosphorylation [ ] . Given this role of persistent EGFR signaling , many trials evaluated the intensification of EGFR inhibition through the use of drug molecules with additional activity against other receptors in the EGFR family , as the second-generation neratinib , dacomitinib and afatinib [ ] . These inhibitors are mainly different from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib for two features : each forms a covalent and irreversible attachment to the EGFR kinase domain , and each also inhibits other members of the ERBB family ( Figure ) .	88	29	resistance or non-response
The lack of efficacy could probably be related to the high concentrations of neratinib required in preclinical studies to inhibit EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and the limitations of clinical dosing .

The occurrence of these secondary mutations spurred development of second and third generation irreversible TKIs which bind covalently to the cysteinyl-797 residue in the pocket of the EGFR-kinase domain and overcome resistance driven by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] .

Unfortunately , upon treatment of these patients with gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , two major mechanisms of resistance have been observed .

First , we generated the PC9-ER cell line by culturing PC9 lung cancer cells , which express the transforming EGFR delE745-A750 allele , in the presence of escalating doses of the EGFR inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ) . Screening of a cDNA library generated from PC9-ER in Ba/F3 cells resulted in multiple full-length clones that harbored EGFR with both delE745-A750 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( ) and were sensitive to the mutant-selective EGFR inhibitor WZ4002 ( LD99 & lt ; 1 µM ) .	33	60	resistance or non-response

The subsequent EGFR mutation analysis revealed a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation of exon 21 and a Q787Q point mutation of exon 20 . Therefore , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was administered orally at a dose of 150 mg daily as the second-line therapy .	24	7	sensitivity
Somatic activating mutations of the EGFR gene have been identified as a major determinant of the clinical response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) such as gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients with NSCLC . Most of these mutations occur in exons 19 to 21 , which encode the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor , the most common being deletions in exon 19 ( such as delE746-A750 ) and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in exon 21 .	30	72	sensitivity

Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are found in many advanced lung cancer patients who respond positively to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors , gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , . However , many of these patients eventually relapse and develop resistance to these EGFR inhibitors .

Conversely , the presence of EGFR activating mutations is highly predictive of response to treatment with gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] .

The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR is structurally analogous to drug resistance mutations in other kinases such as BCR-ABL ( T315I ) , c-KIT ( T670I ) and platelet derived growth factor receptor-α ( PDGFRα ) ( T674I ) [ ] . Furthermore , acquired resistance may be mediated by activation of redundant signaling pathways able to bypass the blockade of single proteins involved in cancer cells proliferation , survival , or migration . Having again the EGFR inhibitors as a paradigm , this is the case of K-Ras mutations leading to constitutive activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway and mediating both intrinsic or acquired resistance to the anti-EGFR mAb <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in colorectal cancers [ ] .	109	1	response 
In the colorectal cancer setting , preclinical in vitro models of resistance to the anti-EGFR mAbs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab include cell lines showing mutations of the K-Ras gene , most frequently in codon 12 of exon 2 , such as SW480 , LS174T , HCT116 , LoVo cells . These mutations produce a single amino acid change resulting in mutant Ras proteins that are insensitive to GAP function and constitutively active , with consequent activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling [ ] . Furthermore , several colorectal cancer cell lines ( VAC0432 , SNU-C5 , HT29 , KM20 , WiDr ) are considered valuable models of resistance to the B- Raf ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) inhibitor vemurafenib [ ] because of the high levels of EGFR expression .	16	111	resistance or non-response

A number of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) ( e.g. , gefitinib , erlotinib , lapatinib ) and antibodies ( eg , trastuzumab , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , panitumumab ) targeting the erbB family have been developed to treat breast , colorectal , lung , gastric and head and neck squamous cell cancers [ ] . Despite the improvements achieved in patients treated with reversible inhibitors of EGFR or EGFR and HER2 , primary and acquired resistances to these agents remain a clinical challenge . This is exemplified by the development of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , through emergence of a secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutation in non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) [ ] , which occurs in 50 % of the patients with lung adenocarcinoma [ ] .	26	107	response

Beyond that , it recently became evident that we need to predict therapeutic response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in mCRC not only by KRAS mutational status , but also by NRAS mutational status [ ] , highlighting the increasing importance of mutations in downstream or interacting pathways . As depicted above , it becomes also clear that combined approaches , like the inhibition of the EGFR/BRAF-axis in BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated colorectal cancers [ ] , could be used to overcome primary resistance in histological subtypes .	15	66	resistance or non-response
It has been reported that the use of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was associated with longer overall and progression-free survival among patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated tumors than patients with other KRAS mutated tumors .	8	24	resistance or non-response
Other examples of useful biomarkers are KRAS mutation testing to predict benefit from monoclonal antibodies against EGFR , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab , in metastatic colon cancer [ ] and BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation analysis in metastatic melanoma in order to predict responsiveness to BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib [ ] .	18	30	resistance or non-response
Indeed , there are three currently approved antibodies in clinical use : herceptin ( an anti-HER2 approved to treat breast cancer overexpressing HER2 ) , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and panitumumab ( anti-EGFR approved for treating metastatic colorectal cancer ) [ ] . Furthermore , there are three small-molecule inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase domain ( TKIs ) that interfere with the binding of ATP , also approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer ( i.e. , gefitinib , erlotinib , and lapatinib ) [ ] . These therapeutic molecules are limited by the development of resistance mutations such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR , which necessitates the screening of new inhibitors .	25	98	response 
Patients who had progressed on erlotinib or gefitinib were given afatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , a monoclonal antibody against EGFR . Approximately 94 % of patients , regardless of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation status , had a partial response or stable disease .	12	28	response 
However , acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> can occur because of point mutations in the ATP binding site ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D842V ) [ - ] .	5	20	resistance
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα is a “gatekeeper” mutation : substitution of the gatekeeper threonine ( T674 ) with a bulky amino acid ( I ) blocks access <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , such as nilotinib and dasatinib , to a hydrophobic pocket inside the ATP binding site [ ] .	25 26	0	resistance
To search for novel TKIs to overcome <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance , midostaurin , EXEL-0862 and sorafenib have been investigated both in vitro and in vivo in cells harboring <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα [ , , ] .	7	27	resistance
Independently , Metzgeroth et al. reported limited clinical activity of sorafenib and nilotinib in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive CEL patients [ ] . Therefore , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CEL remains a therapeutic challenge .	24	14	resistance
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutation does not perturb the overall protein structure of PDGFRα , except that the large aliphatic side chain causes a steric hindrance that prevents the binding <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> but not ponatinib ( data not shown ) .	29 30	1	resistance
To examine whether ponatinib is active against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα , we exposed BaF3-T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα cells to ponatinib , sorafenib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( the latter two serving as positive and negative controls , respectively ) ; levels of phosphorylated and total PDGFRα were measured by immunoblotting .	19 20	7	resistance
The phosphorylation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα was altered by sorafenib but <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Figure 1A ) , which is consistent with a previous report [ ] .	10 11	3	resistance
In contrast to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , 300 nM ponatinib inhibited phosphorylation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα to a similar degree as 1000 nM sorafenib ( Figure A ) .	3	11	resistance
Treatment for 24 h with ponatinib reduced the phosphorylation of Stat3 , Stat5 , Akt and Erk1/2 in cells expressing WT or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> PDGFRα at 0.3-30 nM ( Figure D ) and over time ( Figure E ) . Ponatinib inhibits growth of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and -sensitive CEL cells bearing PDGFRα	43	22	resistance
The in vivo antineoplastic activity of ponatinib as a single agent against <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα expressing cells was evaluated in the nude mouse xenograft model .	12	13	resistance
Ponatinib potently abrogates the growth of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> neoplastic cells expressing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα in nude mouse xenografts .	6	10	resistance
Our molecular docking analysis revealed that ponatinib could target native or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα in the DFG-out ( inactive ) binding mode , similar to ponatinib docking in T315I Bcr-Abl . This characteristic of ponatinib may be related to its imidazo [ 1,2b ] pyridazine core that occupies the pocket for adenine in the enzyme , whereas the methylphenyl group occupies the hydrophobic pocket behind the gatekeeper residue of the enzyme [ ] . Encouraged by the in silico simulation results , we evaluated the efficacy of ponatinib against <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CEL cells both in vitro and in vivo .	88	11	resistance
Given the FDA approval of oral ponatinib in patients with refractory CML and Ph + ALL resistant to the first- and second-generation of TKIs [ ] , our findings warrant a clinical trial of ponatinib in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CEL and other malignant disorders harboring <ANNO_TYPE_variant> PDGFRα .	36	43	resistance
However , acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> can occur because of point mutations in the ATP binding site ( e.g. , T674I and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ - ] .	5	22	resistance or non-response
The activity of crenolanib has been compared with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in a panel of mutated PDGFRα expressing cell lines [ ] . Crenolanib displayed strong anti-proliferative activity in BaF3 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and EOL-1 cell lines with PDGFRα dependent growth .	8	28	resistance or non-response

Given the limited sample size , the extent of tumor shrinkage could not be correlated either to mutational status or to other clinical features , such as tumor site , initial tumor size , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> duration , and extent of pathologic response . In light of these results the presence of a less sensitive mutation like Exon 9 or of a wild-type KIT/PDGFRα mutational status should not be considered per se a contraindication to a preoperative treatment , the only exception being those point mutations with known complete resistance ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in Exon 18 on PDGRα gene ) .	34	90 91	resistance or non-response
To explore potential target genes or mechanisms underlying <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in wild-type GISTs , we integrated CGH and expression profiling in 32 gastric GISTs , including four wild-type GISTs and one imatinib-resistant PDGFRA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant GIST .	8	33	resistance or non-response

These observations were validated in clinical samples by qRT-PCR : CN gain of GSTT1 was detected in 90 % of wild-type and 100 % of PDGFRA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> GISTs , and all cases with GSTT1 CN gain showed disease progression during <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy .	40	26	resistance or non-response
In addition to upregulation of IGF1R and VEGF , frequent CN gain and increased mRNA expression of GSTT1 as well as significant overexpression of ZNF subfamily members were observed in wild-type/PDGFRA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> GISTs compared to KIT-mutant GISTs . CN gain of GSTT1 was closely associated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance .	46	31	resistance or non-response
A low tumor mitotic count , gastric location , and patient allocation to the 3-year adjuvant <ANNO_TYPE_drug> arm were strongly associated with favorable RFS in univariable survival analyses ( each P & lt ; .001 ; ; ) .

For this reason , we hypothesized that in the AIO KRK-0104 trial primary tumor location in the left colon might have a favorable prognostic effect in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors , but not in patients with KRAS mutant tumors when receiving <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based first-line therapy . In fact , OS and PFS differed significantly when comparing left- to right sided tumors .

This mutation results in elevated basal kinase activity , the activation of the ERK pathway and cellular transformation [ ] .

In the colorectal cancer setting , preclinical in vitro models of resistance to the anti-EGFR mAbs cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> include cell lines showing mutations of the K-Ras gene , most frequently in codon 12 of exon 2 , such as SW480 , LS174T , HCT116 , LoVo cells . These mutations produce a single amino acid change resulting in mutant Ras proteins that are insensitive to GAP function and constitutively active , with consequent activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling [ ] . Furthermore , several colorectal cancer cell lines ( VAC0432 , SNU-C5 , HT29 , KM20 , WiDr ) are considered valuable models of resistance to the B- Raf ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) inhibitor vemurafenib [ ] because of the high levels of EGFR expression .	18	111	resistance or non-response

Targeting the oncogenic fusion protein echinoderm microtubule associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( EML4-ALK ) with TKIs such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has also been shown to be negatively affected by the development of secondary gate keeper residue mutations such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and the emergence of fusion negative tumors that render the disease insensitive to the drug .	19	39	 resistance

The <ANNO_TYPE_drug> EGFR [ T790M-L858R ] mutation was also tested .	38	19 20	sensitivity
T790M is a secondary mutation which endows <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> lesion .	7	11	sensitivity
Taken together , the results described above suggest that the jgIs6 transgenic strain expressing the chimeric LET-23 : : hEGFR-TK [ <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ] protein display characteristics that are consistent with over-activation of the EGFR pathway in the Muv mutants . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib inhibit the Muv phenotype of jgIs6	40	21	sensitivity
To determine whether the jgIs6 transgenic strain expressing the chimeric LET-23 : : hEGFR-TK [ <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ] protein could be used in a large-scale screen for human EGFR-TK inhibitors , we tested the effects of the drugs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib .	37	15	sensitivity
Assuming similar levels of transgenic expression , the observed difference in activity is likely due to a decrease in drug sensitivity conferred by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . 10.1371/journal.pone.0042441.g002The Muv phenotype of jgIs6 and jgIs25 reflects similar responses as human cancers have against the anti-cancer drugs , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and elrotinib .	46	24	sensitivity

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> effectively suppressed the Muv phenotype of transgenic strains expressing EGFR mutations such as EGFR [ <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ] ( jgIs6 ) , and was ineffective on gefitinib-resistant mutations , such as EGFR [ T790M-L858R ] ( jgIs25 ) .	0	16	sensitivity
Gefitinib effectively suppressed the Muv phenotype of transgenic strains expressing EGFR mutations such as EGFR [ <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ] ( jgIs6 ) , and was ineffective on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mutations , such as EGFR [ T790M-L858R ] ( jgIs25 ) .	26	16	sensitivity
In vivo PET imaging was performed in 18 mice ( 6 per tumor pair ) before and after treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . MicroPET images demonstrated that highest accumulation level of morpholino- [ 124I ] IPQA was observed in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> tumor xenograft at 24 hours after radiotracer administration .	20	38	sensitivity
Pretreatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 100 mg/kg 1 h before administration of morpholino- [ 124I ] IPQA ) results in 53 % and 38 % decrease in the accumulation of radiotracer in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and E746-A750 del tumors , respectively ( Figures - right panels , ) .	2	31	sensitivity
The locations of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutations are shown within the activating loop of the tyrosine kinase , whereas the in-frame deletion , E746-A750 del , is present within another loop which flanks the ATP cleft [ ] . Those mutations are predicted to alter the position of these amino acids relative to that of phosphorylation status of the cells and the sensitivity of inhibitor ( i.e. , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) .	68	4	sensitivity

Predominant accumulations of morpholino- [ 124I ] IPQA in EGFR expressing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and E746-A750 del carcinoma tumor xenografts reflect the high level of phosphorylated EGFR expression and activity in those tumor cells , which are known to be responsive to therapy with small molecular inhibitors of EGFR ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) [ ] .	50	11	sensitivity
H1299 EGFR tumor had lower morpholino- [ 124I ] IPQA accumulation and produced similar images before and after treatment with EGFR inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Iressa ) .

As a breakthrough of NSCLC treatment management in 2004 , Lynch et al. [ ] first reported that specific mutations in EGFR gene in NSCLC patients were correlated with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . These findings were confirmed by Pao et al. in the tumor cells from the patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation but not for L747-S752 del EGFR mutant [ ] .	36	54	sensitivity
These findings were confirmed by Pao et al. in the tumor cells from the patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation but not for L747-S752 del EGFR mutant [ ] .

The authors also concluded that the affinity for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was 20-fold higher than that for wild type , which could be explained by its tighter binding to active conformation of the tyrosine kinase domain .	12	9	sensitivity
Also , it could be expected to predict the efficacy in the treatment of the subgroup with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Tracy et al. suggested that targeted agents developed to inhibit AKT pathway may be therapeutically more effective than those designed to inhibit the ERK 1/2 pathway in patients whose tumors contain EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> if the AKT pathway is consistently active [ ] .	17	51	sensitivity
Further study could be the mono/combinations of chemotherapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or inhibitors of the AKT pathway which should be tested in vitro in cell lines and in vivo in tumor xenografts with EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations to determine whether these may be additive or synergistic .	9	33	sensitivity

To assess the effect of anti-ErbB3 monoclonals as sensitizers to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , we focused on MPEDCC Pe e/10 , which has high expression of ErbB3/ high resistance to the drug ( IC50=9,3 μM ) and PC9ZD resistant cell line which contains the Del exon and harbors <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( IC50 = 14,4 μM ) .	10	46 47	resistance or non-response

Therapy of NSCLC with first generation small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , is severely limited by two main factors : first , the poor sensitivity to TKIs of tumor cells expressing wild type forms of the receptor [ - ] ; second the emergence of drug resistance in virtually all tumors bearing EGFR mutations initially sensitive for the presence of either exon 19 deletions or exon 21 mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ - , ] .	12	72	sensitivity

The amino acid change does not appear to diminish the catalytic activity of EGFR , but based upon crystal structure analyses , it is predicted to impair binding of either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib to the EGFR ATP binding pocket .

For example , although somatic <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in patients who never received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib are rare , they can occasionally be found in tumors with primary drug resistance .	12	5	resistance or non-response
Mutations that lead to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 in the EGFR kinase domain have been found in about 50 % of tumors from patients with acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitors , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib – . EGFRT790M alleles also have been detected in a minority of tumors with primary resistance to these drugs . Although such mutations are predominantly somatic , a family with a germline <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation has also been described .	36	71	resistance or non-response
These cells harbor EGFRL858R+T790M and are resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in vitro .

The most common mechanism of acquired resistance to erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is emergence of the “gatekeeper” mutation in EGFR itself , which likely indicates the “addiction” of lung cancer to EGFR signaling . A single amino acid change , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 20 of the EGFR gene , is found in about 50 % to 60 % of patients developing resistance [ ] .	10	39	resistance or non-response

EGFR TKIs ( such as erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) are selective inhibitors of EGFR 's kinase domain , that work by competing with ATP at the ATP binding site , thereby preventing autophosphorylation and activation . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation affects the gatekeeper residue in the catalytic-kinase domain and confers drug resistance by increasing EGFR 's affinity for ATP – thus reducing the potency of the ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors [ ] .	7	37	resistance or non-response
The novel inhibitor CO-1686 showed promising results in NSCLC patients with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutation that were previously treated with the first-line EGFR inhibitor ( erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) ( NCT01526928 ) .	27	12	resistance or non-response
Eighty-five percent of all EGFR activating mutations are exon 19 in-frame deletions or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and they tend to be sensitive to currently approved EGFR inhibitors ( reviewed in [ ] ) . Class III mutations ( exon 20 ) are generally insensitive to EGFR inhibitors with exception of A763_Y764insFQEA [ ] . Patients with AC and “large cell” histology NSCLC should be tested at diagnosis for EGFR mutations , as those who exhibit such mutations benefit from EGFR inhibitors ( e.g. , erlotinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , or afatinib ) in the first-line setting .	84 85	13	sensitivity
However , FDA withdrew approval for use of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in new patients due to lack of evidence that it extends life . In May 2013 FDA approved a companion diagnostic test for erlotinib ( Cobas ) that detects exon 19 deletions or exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitutions .	8	44	sensitivity
Finally , another important issue that needs to be addressed is the phenomenon of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Although the majority of patients with EGFR mutations respond to this drug and have a prolonged PFS , inevitably , all patients will experience progression of the disease . In this regard , it has been shown that approximately 50 % of the patients who progress following initial response to an EGFR TKI do have the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations , whereas 25 % of the patients show amplification of the gene that encodes for the MET receptor .	17	75	resistance or non-response
In both cases , this event seems to be due to selection of tumor cells that harbor the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or that have amplification of MET at the diagnosis.– Because new agents that are able to block the activation of the T790M mutant EGFR or of MET will soon be available for clinical use , it will be important to develop techniques for the molecular monitoring of NSCLC patients who are treated <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	72 73	18	resistance or non-response
Randomized clinical trials have shown patient responses to the TKIs Erlotinib ( Tarceva , OSI Pharmaceutical ) or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Iressa , Astrazeneca ) as first-line treatment in approximately two thirds of patients with EGFR mutated tumors with rates far superior to those obtained with conventional platinum based chemotherapy [ - ] . EGFR mutations have become “critical” biomarkers to appropriately select patients for TKIs treatment , and guidelines for molecular diagnosis have been outlined by professional organizations both in Europe and in the United States [ , ] . Most - 80-90 % - of the EGFR mutations are either small exon 19 deletions or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 21 , but other TKIs sensitive EGFR mutations can occur in exons 12 , 19 , 20 , 21 .	18	107	sensitivity

The remarkable association between certain EGFR mutations , especially exon 19 deletions or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 21 and clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and Erlotinib , is well established [ - , -, ] .	37	13	sensitivity
These agents are irreversible inhibitors and covalently bind to Cys-797 of the EGFR ATP binding domain , and they seem to overcome resistance introduced by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation that is seen with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib .	32	26	resistance or non-response
Interestingly , it has also been found to be effective in treating patients with de novo <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations .

More recently , a combination of afatinib and cetuximab , allowing for a complete EGFR blockade , has shown clinical benefit with a 36 % partial response ( PR ) rate overall and a 29 % PR rate in confirmed <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations .	13	90	resistance or non-response

Recent analyses ( ) of phase II and III trials for EGFR-TKI , in which patients were not selected based on their mutation status , have suggested that EGFR mutations are correlated with response to therapy but are not correlated with overall survival ( OS ) . Furthermore , EGFR gene amplification/copy number ( ; ) or overexpression ( ) has been shown to be a more useful prognostic marker of response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment .	109	29 30	sensitivity

EGFR M+ NSCLC cells ( HCC-827 , PC-9 ) were markedly more sensitive to growth inhibition by an EGFR TKI ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) as well as the AKT inhibitor MK2206 , compared with EGFR wild-type cells ( A549 ) and EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells ( H1975 ) ( Table ) .	21	41	resistance or non-response
For example , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of the EGFR gene retains the ability of the receptor to activate the downstream pathway but simultaneously decreases binding of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib to the receptor and thus leads to drug resistance .	26	4	resistance or non-response
In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene are targeted by recently introduced small molecule inhibitors , erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The most common mutations , found in & gt ; 90 % of cases , are either a deletion present in exon 19 or the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 .	34	63	sensitivity
Deletion of exon 19 and the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR are associated with elevated phosphorylated AKT and sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	25	8	sensitivity
Somatic mutations of the EGFR gene , most commonly <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( exon 21 ) and short in-frame deletions in exon 19 , have recently been identified as catalytic domain mutation hotspots ( ) . These mutations confer enhanced sensitivity towards the anilinoquinazoline kinase inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ; ) .	46	9	sensitivity
We recently identified a novel EGFR kinase domain somatic mutation , E884K ( Glu884Lys , exon 22 ) in a patient with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , in combination with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( L858R+E884K ) ( ) . The patient initially received carboplatin/paclitaxel and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and then developed brain metastasis on maintenance erlotinib .	49	35	sensitivity
We recently identified a novel EGFR kinase domain somatic mutation , E884K ( Glu884Lys , exon 22 ) in a patient with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , in combination with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( L858R+E884K ) ( ) . The patient initially received carboplatin/paclitaxel and erlotinib and then developed brain metastasis on maintenance <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	57	35	sensitivity
The E884K mutation represents the first mutation reported to show an apparent differential response to the two EGFR kinase inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib , while <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was known to be sensitizing to both .	20	25	sensitivity
Further biochemical analysis in our current study indicates that the double mutant EGFR ( L858R+E884K ) responds differently to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . We now show that E884K works in concert with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and in a dominant fashion , to mediate differential sensitivity to kinase inhibitors via altered phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3 and were correlated with differential cellular cytotoxicity and induction of the apoptotic marker cleaved-PARP ( Asp214 ) by EGFR inhibitors .	21	32	sensitivity
To test this hypothesis , EGFR expression constructs engineered with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> (LR) or dual mutations of L858R+E884K ( LR+EK ) were stably transfected into COS-7 cells . Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib in the presence of EGF stimulation ( ) .	35	10	sensitivity
Compared to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> alone , the L858R+E884K dual mutant was less sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR .	13	2	sensitivity
E884K in-cis with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> decreased <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition of AKT and STAT3 phosphorylation but increased inhibition by gefitinib .	5	3	sensitivity
Similarly , there was an opposite effect of the E884K mutation over <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in-cis in inducing cellular cytotoxicity by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib ( ) .	19	12	sensitivity
Finally , we mapped the locations of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and E884K mutations onto the three-dimensional structure of the EGFR kinase domain complexed with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and with lapatinib [ PDB accession codes 1M17 ( ) and 1XKK ( ) ] ( ) .	23	8	sensitivity
COS-7 cells transfected to express the indicated mutant EGFR receptors were inhibited using either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib in vitro with increasing concentrations . Similar to E884K , R958D modulated the sensitizing effect of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> differentially to reversible EGFR inhibitors when in-cis ( with L858R ) .	14	33	sensitivity
R958D mutation , when in-cis with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , decreased the sensitivity of the mutant receptor to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition , while increasing the sensitivity to gefitinib in a dominant fashion ( ) .	16	6	sensitivity
Our biochemical studies here now show that E884K mutation in-cis with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> differentially altered inhibitor sensitivity when compared to L858R alone , through differential inhibition of the pro-survival AKT and STAT3 signaling pathways associated with altered induction of cleaved-PARP ( Asp214 ) . This is also shown to occur in an inhibitor-specific manner within the class of various ERBB family small molecule inhibitors , including reversible single EGFR or dual inhibitors ( gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , lapatinib , 4557W , GW583340 , and AG1478 ) and irreversible EGFR inhibitor ( CL-387,785 ) .	74	11	sensitivity

Moreover , the E884K alone and L858R+E884K double mutant EGFR remained sensitive to EGF , and the E884K mutation cooperates with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> when in-cis to enhance the mutational effects on downstream phosphoprotein activation .	31	71	sensitivity
E884K mutation of EGFR worked in concert with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> to differentially alter sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib ( A ) Stable COS-7 transfects expressing the L858R and double mutant L858R+E884K variants of EGFR were used in the experiment .	17	8	sensitivity
The E884K mutation negatively modulated the effect of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition in a dominant fashion but enhanced sensitivity of the mutant receptor to gefitinib inhibition .	10	8	sensitivity

( D ) COS-7 cells with stable transduced expression of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or L858R+E884K mutant EGFR were tested in cellular cytotoxicity assay in vitro under drug treatment with either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib at indicated concentrations .	28	10	sensitivity
E884K mutation , when in-cis with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , significantly decreased the sensitivity of cell viability inhibition by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> compared with L858R alone ;	17	6	sensitivity
In the case of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , E884K was desensitizing to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , leading to lower cytotoxicity ( 56.3 ±2.68 % increased viable cells after inhibition at 5 μM , P=0.0004 ) compared with L858R alone .	4	10	sensitivity
Disruption of the conserved Glu ( E ) 884-Arg ( R ) 958 salt bridge by a R958D substitution differentially altered <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant receptor sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors ( A ) Stable COS-7 transfects expressing the sensitizing L858R and double mutant L858R+R958D variants of EGFR were cultured in 0.5 % BSA containing serum-free media for 16 hours , and then incubated with increasing concentrations of either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib , in the presence of EGF stimulation ( 100 ng/ml ) .	66	21	sensitivity
R958D mutation modulated the effect of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> on inhibitor sensitivity resulting in desensitization of the mutant receptor to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition but modestly enhanced sensitivity to gefitinib inhibition .	18	6	sensitivity
( B ) Densitometric quantitation of the p-EGFR [ Y1068 ] levels showing that R958D mutation differentially altered <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant receptor sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( more resistant ) and gefitinib ( more sensitive ) .	23	18	sensitivity
These mutations confer enhanced sensitivity towards the anilinoquinazoline kinase inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ; ) . A mutation conferring resistance to these two kinase inhibitors , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( exon 20 ) , has also been found in the EGFR kinase domain and can account for about half of the cases of acquired resistance ( ) .	12	27	resistance or non-response
Such alterations include deletions in exon 19 and point mutations in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . For example , although somatic T790M mutations in patients who never received gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are rare , they can occasionally be found in tumors with primary drug resistance .	31	14	sensitivity
Both mutants are associated with sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , . Here , to facilitate comparisons , we used the same tet-inducible system to develop mouse lung tumor models that express the EGFRT790M mutant . We first generated a double mutant EGFR allele encoding the T790M mutation associated with EGFR kinase inhibitor resistance together with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation associated with drug sensitivity ( ) .	7	55	sensitivity
While drug-sensitive <ANNO_TYPE_variant> bearing lungs showed degenerating tumor after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ) , EGFRL858R+T790M bearing tumors contained virtually all viable cells with no treatment effect ( and ) .	9	2	sensitivity
Furthermore , while <ANNO_TYPE_variant> treated tumor cells demonstrated a dramatic decrease in phospho-EGFR staining ( ) , the treated C/L858R+T790M tumor cells continued to display reactivity with phospho-EGFR antibody . Consistent with this , immunoblotting analyses indicated that lysates made from lungs of drug treated C/L858R+T790M animals continued to display reactivity with phospho-EGFR-specific antibodies ( ) . In total , none of the eight <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treated animals displayed evidence of significant response to the kinase inhibitor .	64	3	sensitivity
Point mutations in the kinase domain of mutant epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFRs ) are associated with acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitors , gefitinib ( Iressa ) and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Tarceva ) in human lung adenocarcinoma – . The most common ( & gt ; 90 % ) second-site mutation involves a C→T change at nucleotide 2369 in exon 20 , which results in substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	30	74 75	resistance or non-response

The amino acid change does not appear to diminish the catalytic activity of EGFR , but based upon crystal structure analyses , it is predicted to impair binding of either gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to the EGFR ATP binding pocket .	70	34 35	resistance or non-response
The amino acid change does not appear to diminish the catalytic activity of EGFR , but based upon crystal structure analyses , it is predicted to impair binding of either gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to the EGFR ATP binding pocket . Although identified in the context of drug resistance , emerging data suggest that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> change may potentiate oncogenic activity , either by itself or in association with alterations in the EGFR kinase domain already known to confer gain-of-function properties – .	32	54	resistance or non-response
For example , although somatic <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in patients who never received gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are rare , they can occasionally be found in tumors with primary drug resistance .	14	5	resistance or non-response
We further tested whether <ANNO_TYPE_variant> expressing lung tumors would respond to the kinase inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , or an hsp90 inhibitor , 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) .	15	4	resistance or non-response
Both mutants are associated with sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , . Here , to facilitate comparisons , we used the same tet-inducible system to develop mouse lung tumor models that express the EGFRT790M mutant .

Finally , as expected , tumors did not respond to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ; none of five animals treated for 7 to 30 days with 50 mg/kg/d showed any tumor response ( and ) . Others have reported that in a family with multiple cases of lung adenocarcinoma associated with germline transmission of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , four of six tumors analyzed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing showed a secondary somatic activating EGFR mutation , arising in cis with the germline T790M mutation .	10	52	resistance or non-response
Mutations that lead to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 in the EGFR kinase domain have been found in about 50 % of tumors from patients with acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitors , gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> – . EGFRT790M alleles also have been detected in a minority of tumors with primary resistance to these drugs . Although such mutations are predominantly somatic , a family with a germline <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation has also been described .	38	71	resistance or non-response
These cells harbor EGFRL858R+T790M and are resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in vitro . In the future , we hope to find agents that can induce sustained tumor responses in these lung tumor bearing animals . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance to EGFR inhibitors remains a significant clinical problem .	8	34	resistance or non-response

Eighty-five percent of all EGFR activating mutations are exon 19 in-frame deletions or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and they tend to be sensitive to currently approved EGFR inhibitors ( reviewed in [ ] ) . Class III mutations ( exon 20 ) are generally insensitive to EGFR inhibitors with exception of A763_Y764insFQEA [ ] . Patients with AC and “large cell” histology NSCLC should be tested at diagnosis for EGFR mutations , as those who exhibit such mutations benefit from EGFR inhibitors ( e.g. <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , gefitinib , or afatinib ) in the first-line setting .	82 83	13	sensitivity

The most common mechanism of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib is emergence of the “gatekeeper” mutation in EGFR itself , which likely indicates the “addiction” of lung cancer to EGFR signaling .

EGFR TKIs ( such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib ) are selective inhibitors of EGFR 's kinase domain , that work by competing with ATP at the ATP binding site , thereby preventing autophosphorylation and activation . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation affects the gatekeeper residue in the catalytic-kinase domain and confers drug resistance by increasing EGFR 's affinity for ATP – thus reducing the potency of the ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors [ ] .	5	37	resistance or non-response
HER2 amplification and EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) were mutually exclusive in this setting . Afatinib ( second-generation EGFR inhibitor ) and cetuximab ( anti-EGFR antibody ) significantly inhibit HER2 phosphorylation in vitro , suggesting that tumors acquiring resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> should be tested for HER2 status and potentially treated with a pan-EGFR TKI inhibitor such as afatinib [ ] .	39	5	resistance or non-response

However , treatment with these reversible TKIs produces objective responses in a rather small subset of patients , possibly corresponding to individuals with activating mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain , such as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , . Despite positive initial response , these patients almost invariably develop acquired secondary resistance , such as substitution of threonine 790 with methionine ( T790M ) , to these reversible inhibitors and relapse after several months , , , which accounts for about half of all cases of resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , .	90	35	sensitivity

Some classify this mutation as resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib , nilotinib , and bosutinib , whereas O’Hare et al report this mutation to be sensitive ( IC50 48 nM for nilotinib and 1.8 nM for dasatinib ) to second-generation TKIs . The mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> located in the adenosine triphosphate binding region is associated with resistance to dasatinib , and these patients may respond positively to nilotinib. , ,	7	44	None

In addition , ponatinib has proven efficacy in mouse models of CML and was also found to be effective in a small cohort of patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in two recent clinical trials [ , , ] ( phase 1 : NCT00660920 ; phase 2 : NCT01207440 ; http : //www.clinicaltrials.gov ) . Surprisingly , although ponatinib represents a promising molecule for patients with BCR-ABL mutations , its mechanism of action has not been extensively studied , more particularly in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CML cells with no BCR-ABL mutation .	80	26	None
Our results indicate that ponatinib is effective on all CML cell lines in vitro , whatever the mode of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Interestingly , in our hands the cells carrying the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation seems less sensitive to the effect of ponatinib that the one carrying the T315I mutation .	21	32	None
K562 , Lama and JURLMK-1 cells <ANNO_TYPE_drug> have been described earlier [ , ] . The BaF3 p210 BCR ABL WT , T31I and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells were kindly provided by Pr. FX Mahon and have been described previously [ ] .	6	24	None
Cell lines were incubated for 48h with increasing concentrations of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib or ponatinib and cell viability was assessed using the XTT assay . We first investigated the effect of these ITKs on the viability of murine Ba/F3 cells , carrying wild type ( WT ) BCR-ABL , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or G250E-BCR-ABL mutation .	10	49	None
As shown in Figure , BaF3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL were highly sensitive to imatinib , dasatinib and ponatinib , whereas BaF3-T315I-BCR-ABL and BaF3-G250E-BCR-ABL cells were resistant to both <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and dasatinib . By contrast , ponatinib induced loss of cell viability in BaF3 cells carrying the T315I or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , in agreement with previous results from the literature [ , ] .	29	49	None
The relative degree of imatinib resistance , defined by in vitro drug inhibition of kinase activity tends to be mutant specific with some mutations conferring only low-level resistance that may respond to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> dose escalation ( e.g. , M351T ) and others conferring high-level resistance to imatinib and other TKIs ( e.g. , T315I , G250E , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , thus implying imatinib “failure” and the need for a change in therapy.

Four patients ( three <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant , two of whom carried the known imatinib-resistance mutation , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) achieved a major cytogenetic response , which corresponded with 1- or 2-log reductions in BCR-ABL transcript levels , and an overall 32 % median reduction in BCR-ABL transcripts after 4 weeks of treatment .	4	16	None
Human CML cell lines ( KBM5 , KBM5-T315I and K562 ) , and a pair of murine myeloid cells 32D stably transfected with either the wild-type or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> human Bcr-Abl were exposed to escalating concentrations of pristimerin for 72 h , followed by the MTS assay . Cell viability of all 5 lines of CML cells was inhibited , with IC50 values of 199 nM , 135 nM , 450 nM , 242 nM and 387 nM , respectively ( Figure ) . These data suggest similar sensitivities of imatinib-sensitive and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CML cells to pristimerin .	91	27	None
Using this insight , new small-molecule inhibitors have been identified that retain activity against the majority of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> BCR-ABL mutants [ , ] . For example , in CML , a commonly found mutation is a C→T single nucleotide change that replaces threonine with isoleucine at position 315 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the ABL kinase domain [ , , ] .	17	48 49	None
Based upon analogous studies in other diseases with another kinase inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , a single amino acid substitution from threonine to methionine at position 790 in the wild-type EGFR kinase domain was predicted to lead to drug resistance , even before the association of exon 19 and 21 mutations of EGFR with drug responsiveness in NSCLC was reported . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was shown in vitro in the context of wild-type EGFR to confer resistance to gefitinib [ ] and a related quinazoline inhibitor , PD153035 [ ] .	12	61	None
Analysis of earlier passages of H1975 cells for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation would be informative in this regard . Recently , new small-molecule inhibitors have been identified that retain activity against the majority of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> BCR-ABL mutants .	33	9	None
Since tumor specimens from three additional patients with acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not demonstrate the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , this specific lesion does not account for all mechanisms of acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib . Given the paradigm established with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , other drug-resistance mutations in EGFR , either within or outside the tyrosine kinase domain , are likely to exist .	44	19	None
The present study identified that the DAPK1 gene is significantly methylated ( including possible hydroxymethylation ) in CML patients and this is correlated with mutations that result in resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Notably , one in two of the patients exhibiting both <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and M351T mutations demonstrated DNA methylation in the DAPK1 promoter region compared with non-resistant patients ; however , none of the patients with T315I alone demonstrated DAPK1 methylation .	30	42	None
These mutations include T315I ( in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding domain of BCR-ABL ) , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( in the catalytic domain ) and E255K ( in the ATP binding domain ) ( , ) .	7	14	None
The findings of the present study indicate that the E255K mutation is not involved in the association between <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance and DAPK1 methylation , instead , M351T is the major mutation in this association . M351T ( which occurs in the catalytic domain of BCR-ABL ) may be more emphasized than mutations in other domains as it increases the catalytic function of kinases . However , it should be noted that some other mutations in BCR-ABL that were not examined in the present study ( such as Y253H , F317L and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( ) require investigation to achieve a broader comparison .	18	91	None
Ponatinib ( AP24534 ) was developed to interact with the inactive ABL conformation at multiple sites and with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , providing high affinity and efficacy . Therefore , it also works against other <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mutations. ( )	35	19	None
Overcoming both losses of an active-site hydrogen bond and the steric hindrance caused by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation were the main focus during the design process of ponatinib . While still binding to the kinase active site of BCR-ABL , the overall design of the ponatinib molecule was still based on the ATP-mimetic template provided by the previous TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , nilotinib , and dasatinib .	58	15	None
Additionally , the Evaluation of Ponatinib versus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( EPIC ) trial , a Phase III trial investigating the use of ponatinib versus imatinib for first-line use , was halted following this decision . The FDA and ARIAD Pharmaceuticals , Inc. “mutually agreed the trial should be terminated” due to the now understood increased cardiovascular risks associated with ponatinib . Ponatinib has since been put back on the market for a narrowed patient population : treatment of adults with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> positive CML ( any phase ) and Ph+ALL , and treatment of adult patients for whom no other TKI therapy is indicated .	7	83	None

Our calculations show that it is advantageous to combine such a future generation drug ( call it drug “K” ) with two drugs that can not act on <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , say , Imatinib ( I ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( D ) .	38 39	28 29	None
At low ( 5 nm ) and medium ( 10–25 nm ) concentrations <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , certain mutations arose <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , F317V , V299L ) that did not also confer resistance to imatinib or nilotinib , suggesting that dasatinib could be used as first-line therapy , with imatinib or nilotinib used later if necessary .	13 14	19 20	None
Conversely , nilotinib seems to be more active against F317L than does <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , , The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is highly resistant to all three TKIs , but fortunately only represents about 15 % of all clinically detected BCR-ABL1 mutations .	12	16	None
In addition to the presence of the T790M variation , L747S , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and G796A variations were identified in NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ; the G796A variant is especially known to cause strong resistance to EGFR-TKIs .	26	12	None
Romano et al. [ ] report that differential co-regulator recruitment explains the opposite transcriptional effect observed at a number of ER-regulated genes in response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in breast cancer ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and endometrial cancer ( ECC1 ) cells .	25	30	None
Moreover , they demonstrate that the transcriptional response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and ECC1 cells can be , in fact , be inverted by over expressing either co-activator SRC-1 or co-repressor SMRT .	9	11	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> , E255K , and F359V were deemed less sensitive , but not inherently resistant , as was the T315I identified in three patients receiving <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	25	0	None

These patients may respond to investigational agents , such as AP24534 or omacetaxine , and should pursue allogeneic stem cell transplantation.– There has been some concern about selecting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> with the increased use of second-generation TKIs . To date , this has not been demonstrated . Other mutations that have varying degrees of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> include G250E , F359V , L248V , Q252H , Y253F , E279K , F317L , L384M , H396P , and H396R .	56	28 29	None

The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation classification is controversial . Some classify this mutation as resistant to imatinib , dasatinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and bosutinib , whereas O’Hare et al report this mutation to be sensitive ( IC50 48 nM for nilotinib and 1.8 nM for dasatinib ) to second-generation TKIs .	18	1	None

As such , imatinib , dasatinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are unable to block the ABL kinase activity of Thr315 point mutations . This highly resistant variation present in the gatekeeper region of the ATP binding site in the ABL kinase domain of BCR-ABL fusion protein accounts for 15 % –20 % of clinically observed mutations . In contrast , ponatinib was designed to avoid binding with the side chain of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in native BCR-ABL , and instead forms beneficial van der Waals interactions with the isoleucine side chain of the T315I mutant .	8	70	None

Furthermore , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( like imatinib and dasatinib ) do not overcome the T315I-Bcr-Abl mutation , which may drive the majority of acquired resistance cases to these compounds . Strategies to override resistance mediated by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation represent the next major goal in the targeted treatment of CML. Compounds such as VX-680 , an aurora kinase inhibitor , capable of binding to and inhibiting kinase activity of the T315I-Bcr-Abl mutation , are very encouraging .	2	36	None

Preliminary results from an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study of the multikinase , pan–BCR-ABL inhibitor ponatinib ( AP24534 ) showed antileukemic activity in patients with refractory CML , including patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Phase 1 and 2 trials of ponatinib are ongoing in patients with refractory CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Danusertib ( PHA-739358 ) is a multikinase aurora inhibitor with in vitro activity against wild-type ABL and ABL/T315I ; preliminary results from an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study indicate antileukemic activity in patients with AP or BC who failed imatinib and/or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or dasatinib .	95	31 32	None

For example , three BCR-ABL mutations ( T315I , Y253H , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) have a predicted role in abrogating binding of imatinib to BCR-ABL in resistant patients . The second-generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor , dasatinib , binds to BCR-ABL with less stringent conformational requirements and was shown to be effective in inhibition of imatinib-resistant mutants . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is another second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor and is significantly more potent than imatinib , and also has activity against a number of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants .	57	12	None

Consequently , inhibition of mTORC1 releases the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated negative feedback loop , resulting in a paradoxical increase of PI3K and Akt activity . Therefore , there is legitimate concern that the efficacy of selective mTORC1 inhibitors , which include rapamycin and its analogs ( rapalogs ) , eg , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , is limited .	50	7	None

A : HCT116 p53−/− cells ( which still express Δ133p53 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells ( mutant p53 ) were treated with a siRNA targeted against p68 or a non silencing control ( NS ) . After 48hr , cells were treated with 100μM <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for 4 hr and expression of p68 and Δ133p53 was examined by qRT-PCR .	45 46	12 13 14	None
To further elucidate the link between p53 dependent transcription and p65 activity , we have screened by qPCR several p53 dependent genes upon 6 h of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment . Conversely , no transcription was induced in MEB-Med8A cells , where the p53 pathway was found to be mutated . The high levels of Fas receptor transcripts were reflected in the expression of the receptor at the plasma membrane in D283-MED and MHH-Med1 cells as measured by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry ( and Supplementary Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	26	84	None
In contrast , p21 expression was barely detectable in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> clone .

A head-to-head trial comparing afatinib to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is still missing . Considering that it is at a minimum equivalent to reversible TKIs , afatinib should be currently considered an alternative drug to use for front-line treatment of EGFR mutated patients . In particular , afatinib should be used in patients with classical mutations in the EGFR gene ( exon 19 deletions and exon 21 point mutations ) and could be considered in the presence of G719X and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations .	6	77	None

The second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors , dasatinib and nilotinib , can circumvent most mutations that confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ; the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , however , causes resistance to all BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors developed so far .	17	20	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation occurs by substitution of the amino acid threonine by methionine in amino acid position 790 ( T790M ) on exon 20 and is similar to the KIT T670I gatekeeper mutation observed in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> gastrointestinal stromal tumor .	34	0	None
In fact , the V299L mutation was later detected in this patient and might explain this clinical course , as this mutation confers a poorer efficacy for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> has the edge over dasatinib as the first choice of a second-generation TKI ( vide supra ) in many ways . Other options include bumping up the dose of imatinib , hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , or the use of an agent undergoing clinical trials . The choice of the second-line therapy is also dictated by whether the patient has a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or not – ponatinib being the most promising agent in such a case .	0	62	None

The data suggest that low BRCA1 level may neutralize the negative effects of the EGFR T790M mutation on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity and that high BRCA1 expression may lead to de novo EGFR TKI resistance potentially through increased DNA damage repair capacity [ ] . In addition to EGFR T790M , primary EGFR TKI resistance may also be due to other secondary mutations in EGFR ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) that occur in cis with an activating EGFR kinase domain mutation ( e.g. , L858R ) [ ] .	18	66	None
In addition to the EGFR T790M mutation , there are three other second-site mutations in EGFR that have been associated with acquired EGFR TKI resistance : T854A in exon21 [ ] , L747S [ ] , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ ] , both in the exon19 .

Similar to the EGFR T790M mutation , alteration of the drug contact residue T854 to a smaller hydrophobic alanine may increase the size of the selectivity pocket and negatively impact <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is thought to shift the equilibrium towards the active conformation of the receptor , while D761Y may affect the catalytic cleft of the receptor .	30	33	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> is thought to shift the equilibrium towards the active conformation of the receptor , while D761Y may affect the catalytic cleft of the receptor . Both T854 and D761 were identified in laboratory models of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in addition to clinical samples [ ] .	36	0	None
For the first cycle , a total of 85 mg ( 40 mg/m2 ) of liposomal <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in 250 ml of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( 5 % glucose solution ) was prescribed with the same premedications used for the prior carboplatin .	16	21	None
Treatment of PC-3 PTEN negative cells with rapamycin inhibited p70 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and increased the proliferative response of these cells to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	22	11	None
Importantly , we also observed that poor patient response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based treatment is significantly associated with high SPHK1 levels . Using xenograft and in vitro models , we demonstrate that inhibition of SPHK1 in TNBC cells reduces growth and attenuates signaling mechanisms in TNBC cells through <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , ERK1/2 and AKT pathways .	10	47	None
Indeed , T798I was confirmed to lead to functional resistance to lapatinib with an about 3-fold increase in the IC50 of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . As many imatinib-resistant mutations of BCR-ABL as well as the recently identified <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of EGFR lead to an IC50 shift in this range , we predict that these mutations will be clinically relevant .	21	35	None
As many imatinib-resistant mutations of BCR-ABL as well as the recently identified <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of EGFR lead to an IC50 shift in this range , we predict that these mutations will be clinically relevant . Our studies suggest that T798I induced <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance can be overcome by irreversible dual ErbB2/EGFR inhibitors , such as PD168393 .	41	12	None

Several Phase Ib/II studies of EGFR TKI ( erlotinib , gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) in combination with inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway , such as BKM120 , MK2206 ( AKT inhibitor ) or everolimus are either ongoing or underway , some of which incorporate enrichment strategies for patients with tumors that harbor the activated PI3K pathway signature ( NCT01570296 , NCT01487265 , NCT01582191 ) . Monotherapy trials using mTOR inhibitors , either as first or subsequent lines of therapy , showed minimal activity in the molecularly unselected population. [ ] The combination of gefitinib with everolimus similarly showed minimal activity in the molecularly unselected population . However , it was interesting to note that objective tumor responses were seen in two patients with the rare KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	12	126	None
For combination experiments , cells were treated as described above , plus 4 h of incubation with trastuzumab ( 10 μg ml−1 ) , or 1 h of incubation with PD98059 ( 25 μM ) or PD153035 ( 0.1 μM ) alone or combined <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> before the incubation with EGF . As <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells express low levels of EGFR , more protein was loaded ( 80 μg , as opposed to 50 μg for the other cells ) on the gels to observe the phosphorylation status of the receptor .	44 45	53	None
Additionally , the targeting of EGFR and HER2 with two different MAbs showed synergistic inhibitory effects ( ) demonstrating that heterodimer signalling is necessary for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell proliferation . Furthermore , these data indicate that the successful inhibition of the MAPK and/or AKT pathways is a determinant factor for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> efficacy in all CC cell lines .	49	25	None

Combinations of therapy such as cetuximab plus erlotinib and gefitinib plus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> have also been tried . The most promising drug thus far has been afatinib ( BIBW2992 ; Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma , Ingelheim , Germany ) , , an ErbB family blocker with reported in vitro and in vivo activity against EGFR mutant tumors harboring exon 19 deletions , exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations and the exon 20 T790M “resistance” mutations .	11	61	None
Either single or combination treatment did not result in protein degradation as indicated by stable protein expression of unphosphorylated <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and 4EBP1 ( ) . Panobinostat and everolimus single treatments result in strong attenuation of p-S6K signaling in both androgen sensitive and castrate resistant tumors , while <ANNO_TYPE_drug> combination appears to have an additive effect of p-S6K signaling compared to single treatments .	47	19	None
Finally , although molecularly targeted therapies ( that is , gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for EGFR and crizotinib for ALK fusions ) are effective in NSCLC , intrinsic or acquired resistances inevitably lead to recurrence and/or metastatic dissemination . This is the case of MET activation/amplification , , or acquired somatic mutations of EGFR ( T790M ) or ALK fusions ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , L1196M and ALK amplification ) . , ,	12	60	None
After 48 h , transfected cells and WT <ANNO_TYPE_variant> were split into 24-well plates ( 3 × 104 cells per well in triplicate ) and treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> 24 h later for 5 days .	27 28	8	None
Of note here , although <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells carry mutant p53 , this mutation ( L194F ) retains significant ability to induce p53 target genes , and this cell line can still undergo p53 dependent apoptosis. , , , As acetylation of p53 is a hallmark of transcriptional activity , , the reduction in its acetylation level in MAGEA2 expressing lines , coupled with decreased expression of the p53 target gene p21cip/CDKN1A in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> media , strongly suggests that MAGEA2 protein is able to protect cells from growth arrest by interfering with the p53 pathway , possibly by altering p53 transcriptional activity directly .	72	5	None
A recent study compared the effect of four TKIs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , sunitinib , vandetanib , and XL184 ) on cell proliferation , RET autophosphorylation , and extracellular signal regulated kinase activation in three cell lines : MZ-CRC-1 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> RET mutation ) , MTC-TT ( C634W RET mutation ) , and TPC-1 ( RET/PTC-1 rearrangement ) cells .	10	39	None

To assess the effect of reduced PTEN on endocrine sensitivity , cells were treated with E2 control , ED , tamoxifen ( Tam ) , or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Ful ) , and cell number was monitored using an in situ cell cytometer ( Celigo , Nexcelom Bioscience ) . As shown in Figure A-D , while cell growth was strongly inhibited by anti-estrogen treatment in PTEN-WT cells , growth inhibition was substantially less in PTEN-KD cells . PTEN-KD significantly attenuated the anti-estrogen effect in blocking cell cycle S-phase entry , which partially explains the cell growth advantage over PTEN-WT cells ( Additional file : Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	26	105	None
ZF-TF infected MCF7 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells , and corresponding control cells were seeded at 1 or 2×103 cells per 96-well plate and grown at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5 % CO2 in the presence of puromycin ( 0.4 micrograms/ml ) only and puromycin plus 100 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for 10–15 days .	47 48	4	None
Based on these results in first line treatment of GIST and based on promising activity in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> GIST patients in the phase I study [ ] , it was decided to start two randomised studies in metastatic GIST—a first line phase III study ( NCT00812240 ) comparing masitinib to imatinib and a second line phase II study ( NCT01506336 ) comparing mastinib to sunitinib . Ridaforolimus Ridaforolimus ( AP23573 , MK-8669 , formerly deforolimus ) is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) , an integral component of the phosphatidyl 3-kinase ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) /AKT signaling pathway .	16	93	None
The biological meaning of these observations was proven by showing that depleting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in the resistant CaLo cells led to regain sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by these cells and that higher sensitivity to gemcitabine was not achieved by adding hydralazine to the G9A depleted cells arguing against an off-target effect of hydralazine .	23	12	None
For example , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , an antibody that blocks a T-cell function regulating surface receptor ( CTLA-4 ) , was approved by the Food & amp ; Drug Administration ( FDA ) for treatment of metastatic melanoma ( Hodi et al. , ) ; Adoptive cell transfer ( ACT ) therapy that utilizes T cells expressing transgenic T cell receptor ( TCR ) or chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) has demonstrated high objective response rate ( & gt ; 40 % ) in Phase II clinical trials ( Rosenberg , ) . The newly approved small molecule drug , vemurafenib , or PLX 4032 , that targets BRAF oncogenic mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , has been found to induce T-cell mediated antitumor response ( Sosman et al. , ; Liu et al. , ) .	3	112	None
Combination of chemotherapy and/or new monoclonal antibody that overcomes CTLA-4 mediated T-cell suppression ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) improved overall survival [ , ] . Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib produced improved rates of overall and progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated melanoma with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] .	14	52	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Trastuzumab-DM1 ) is a new product in which the Trastuzumab moiety binds to HER2 on tumor cell surfaces and , upon internalization , the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin , thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and proliferation . Primary results from the EMILIA study , a randomized trial comparing Trastuzumab DM-1 to lapatinib and capecitabine , have shown that Trastuzumab DM-1 significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer . Further research is looking into inhibiting other targets such as mTOR , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , or AKT pathways .	0 1	96	None

CA46 , DU-145 , Daudi cells , which are reported to be defective for pro-apoptotic proteins BAX/BAK – and KNS62 cells which harbor a BAX <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) inactivating mutation , as observed in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ( COSMIC ) database , did not show induction of apoptosis , assessed by the failure to detect sub-G1 DNA content cells by flow cytometry , as compared to apoptotic-proficient Kasumi-1 cells ( and ) . The response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> demonstrated that the cells were actively dividing and responsive to anti-mitotic agents as measured by flow cytometry .	80	25 26	None
Briefly , they demonstrated the different effects of the G12 and G13 K-Ras alleles on response to cetuximab and found a significant association between the presence of a G13D mutation and survival benefit after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer patients [ ] . Moreover , a paper by Di Nicolantonio et al. demonstrated the different role of PI3K and K-Ras mutations in the response to the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus . In fact , while cells knocked-in for the PIK3-CA alleles H1047R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> showed an increased response to everolimus , oncogenic K-Ras mutations conferred resistance to this agents [ ] .	34	87	None
Further , addition of lapatinib or the HER2 antibody <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to XL-147 in mice with established BT474 xenografts resulted in better growth inhibition as well as reduction of tumor levels of P-HER3 , P-AKT , and P-S6 . T the biologically relevant RTKs that compensate for inhibition of PI3K-AKT in cancers expressing low levels of HER2 are less clear . We have examined this question in ER+/HER2 negative MCF7 human breast cancer cells which also harbor an activating <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in PIK3CA ( p110α ) [ ] .	9	78	None
To gain insights into the structural basis for ponatinib to bind to the ATP binding site of T674I PDGFRα , we performed computer simulations of molecular docking between ponatinib and T674I PDGFRα : ponatinib bound to native or mutated PDGFRα with the same orientation in the DFG-out state ( Additional file : <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . These findings were similar to those observed in the complex between ponatinib and T315I Abl [ , ] . The T674I gatekeeper mutation does not perturb the overall protein structure of PDGFRα , except that the large aliphatic side chain causes a steric hindrance that prevents the binding <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> but not ponatinib ( data not shown ) .	104 105	52 53	None

We have demonstrated that the sensitivity of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> measurement is equivalent to 2500 receptors/cell whereas conventional IHC is typically 7–10 times less sensitive . Therefore , when the cell line MDA-MB-435 is measured by IHC the result is a classification of 0 or negative ( in house data ) . Recently , adjuvant clinical trials have indicated that even patients that are not overexpressing HER2 as measured by IHC and FISH , may respond to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment , indicating that accurate and sensitive measurements at the lower end of the dynamic range may also be clinically relevant [ ] .	76	8	None

Of the nine patients who were enrolled with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in BRAF , four had measurable responses . In addition to seeing responses in all visceral sites , treatment reduced the size of small , asymptomatic , previously untreated brain metastases in all of the subgroups of patients with this condition . Taken together , the early clinical development of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and GSK2118436 clearly confirm that BRAF inhibitors can ( at least temporarily ) halt or reverse disease in patients with melanomas carrying this mutation , apparently improving survival times compared with historically standard treatments ( chemotherapy and interleukin-2 ) , although the follow-up times are still too short to define median overall survival times .	60	8	None
Three thyroid cancer patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations had tumor regression ( range 9 % –16 % ) that did not reach PR .

In conclusion , the results of our retrospective study showed that the patients with BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation had worse prognosis than those with wt-BRAF , with lower response rates and progressed early during systemic treatment , consequently , with less possibilities to achieve resectability of metastatic disease .	35 36	55	None
Treatment with the Ras inhibitors also inhibited cell proliferation as illustrated in Figures 4A and 4E ( NIH 3T3 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells respectively ) .

A decreased incidence of progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis has been reported for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib , and nilotinib when compared with imatinib in upfront therapy , even though these differences have only been reported to be statistically significant in the case of nilotinib to date .	60	42	None

On the other hand , the rate of major molecular response was significantly higher , and complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response were achieved more rapidly with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than with imatinib , suggesting that if early treatment failures can be reduced in the future , patients on bosutinib may achieve both complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response rates that are superior to those of imatinib . In patients with omniresistant mutations , allogeneic stem cell transplantation and interferon are currently the only approved treatment options with a potential life prolongation for patients . This is of particular importance because <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is predicted to have an increased clinical impact in the future because of the growing selection pressure on resistant leukemic subclones under second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment .	28	101	None

A complete hematological response and a major cytogenetic response were observed broadly across the BCR-ABL mutants , including individuals harboring the dasatinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , the nilotinib-resistant Y253H , and F359C/I/V mutations , but not T315I . Nine individuals developed new mutations in the course of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment ( V299L , n = 4 ; L248V , n = 2 ; T315I , n = 2 ; F359C , n = 1 ; G250E , n = 1 ) and eight of these individuals discontinued bosutinib because of progressive disease or unsatisfactory response .	45	22	None
Remarkably , similar responses were observed across all BCR-ABL mutations when compared with wild-type BCR-ABL , with the exception of the highly resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Patients with the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> V299L mutation were not included in the study .	29	23	None

Regarding in vivo studies , genistein has been shown to have preventive effect in the azoxymethane induced rat colon carcinogenesis model [ ] , whereas <ANNO_TYPE_drug> increased aberrant crypt foci by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rats fed diets containing genistein [ ] . On the other hand , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is known to exhibit chemopreventive effects in experimental animal models , such as a spontaneous occurrence of endometrial carcinoma in female Donryu rats [ ] , 7,12-dimethylbenz ( a ) anthracene ( DMBA ) or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea ( MNU ) induced rat carcinogenesis [ ] , or an aflatoxin B1-induced rat carcinogenesis [ ] .	25	46	None

An experiment using cell lines transfected concurrently with activating mutations and a T790M mutation also proved that resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib is evident when this mutation is present [ – ] . Analogous secondary mutations of the BCR-ABL gene in case of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) [ ] and the KIT gene in case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor [ ] have previously been reported as mechanisms of imatinib resistance , which is also a TKI . The structural similarity between ABL and EGFR tyrosine kinases is considerably high , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in ABL corresponds to T790M in EGFR [ ] .	19	93	None
Recent studies demonstrated that concomitant inhibition of FGFR1 and MET ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) blocked the activation of HGF and resulted in sustained cell killing both in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft model of FOP2-FGFR1 aggressive myeloproliferative syndrome/leukaemia [ ] .

The two serines located on TM3 are fully conserved within the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> receptor subfamily and their mutation to alanines brought from a four- to a nine-fold decrease in melatonin binding affinity [ ] . Serine 3.39 is located in the middle of TM3 in many GPCR structures , close to the Asp2 .50 side chain , and it is conserved in more than 70 % of rhodopsin-like receptors . A recent crystallographic study revealed that Ser3.39 in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> adenosine receptor ( Ser913.39 ) is responsible for the stabilization of the sodium ion [ ] , which acts as an allosteric modulator for this receptor subtype [ ] .	11	78	None
In particular , position 6.56 is occupied by hydrophobic residues , such as leucine , isoleucine , phenylalanine or valine in more than 70 % of class A GPCRs and in all the receptors of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> subfamily . Compared to position 6.56 , residues at position 6.59 are more solvent exposed , and they often form extensive hydrophobic interactions with amino acids laying at the N-terminus of TM5 ( e.g. , Val2976.59 of the β2 adrenergic receptor and Phe2576.59 of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> adenosine receptor ) and with residues located at the C-terminal stretch of ECL2 ( e.g. , Phe2766.59 of rhodopsin ) .	36	81 82	None
This mutation increases the affinity of the EGFR for ATP approximately 10-fold and allows ATP to competitively displace gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> from EGFR [ ] .

Less frequent activating mutations including G719S in exon 18 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 have also been described . Prospective studies of EGFR TKIs in patients with EGFR mutations have consistently identified high response rates and prolonged progression free survival .

Likewise , codon 61 has been included in many diagnostic tests because the KRAS mutation in codon 61 predicts resistance to cetuximab plus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in KRAS codon 12 and 13 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer [ ] . Moreover , the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the BRAF gene is more and more frequently taken into consideration before patient targeted therapy qualification , because wild-type BRAF is required for a response to panitumumab or cetuximab [ , ] .	23	43	None
SSCP analysis indicated KRAS WT status , which qualified him for concomitant targeted therapy ( cetuximab : first dose , 400 mg/m2 day 1 ; subsequent doses : 250 mg/m2 ) and chemotherapy ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> 180 mg/m2 day 1 , 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 bolus and then 2,400 mg/m2 over 48 h ; leucovorin 200 mg/m2 before 5-fluorouracil ) . At first , partial remission was observed , but therapy was stopped after seven cycles due to clinical and radiological progression of the disease .

Mutation of any of these residues , except for V560 , also confers resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . This analysis thus highlights the polymorphous structural properties of JMR and A-loop , tolerating mutations which provoke the deregulation of the kinase activity without altering the integrity of its structure .

The single factor H mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the PROMISSE cohort was extensively investigated and not shown to have a functional defect ( normal secretion in a transfection system , normal plasma levels , and normal to increased C3b binding and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> activity ) ( unpublished data ) .	42	6	None
Given the lower binding to C4b , we suspected that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant form of MCP would have a decreased capacity to serve as a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for CFI mediated cleavage of C4b .	25	11	None
To examine this possibility , we performed <ANNO_TYPE_drug> assays comparing the ability of wild-type MCP and rare mutant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> to serve as cofactors for cleavage of C3b and C4b by monitoring loss of the α′ chain and generation of cleavage fragments ( C4d in the case of C4b and α1 in the case of C3b ) ( ) .	7	18	None
As predicted by the binding studies , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> activity for C3b was similar for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant and wild-type MCP , whereas the K32N mutant showed decreased CFI mediated cleavage activity for C4b .	7	15	None
At 20 min in the C4b <ANNO_TYPE_drug> activity assay , no C4d was detected in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> lane , but an easily discernable band in wild-type MCP .	6	16	None

These results demonstrate that both <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and UCN-01 were bioavailable in the tumor . Interestingly , two patients with TNBC responded to therapy and both of their tumors were found to have defective p53 .

The only exception is the breast tumor kinase (BRK) , which is inhibited at 130 nM , a one-log difference compared to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated B-Raf kinase [ ] . In the current studies we analyzed a panel of human melanoma cell lines with defined oncogenic alterations for sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	50	23	None
The increase in pErk in an NRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant cell line could be explained by abrogation of negative feedback loops mediated mainly by dual specificity phosphatases ( MKPs/DUSPs ) , as reported with Mek inhibitors [ , ] , and the recent description of increased C-Raf signaling when heterodimerizing with inhibited B-Raf in BRAF wild type cells [ , ] . Therefore , the modulation of feed-back loops and alteration of Raf dimerization upon treatment with Raf inhibitors may also have a role in the differential sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in BRAFV600E mutant cell lines .	88	7	None
We tested the ability of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to differentially block MAPK pathway signaling in a panel of human melanoma cell lines ( Table ) by quantitating the inhibition of phosphorylated Erk ( pErk ) , a downstream target of B-Raf activity , using intracellular phosphospecific flow cytometry ( Figure ) . As expected , cell lines with BRAFV600E mutation had a fast ( detectable at 1 hour ) and sustained ( persistent at 20 hours , Figure ) inhibition of pErk , although one of the cell lines ( M263 ) had lower inhibition of pErk than the rest . There was no pErk inhibition in two cell lines with NRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( M202 and M207 ) and a cell line wild type for both oncogenes ( M257 ) .	5	110	None
Independent associations between folate intake , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> consumption , and MTHFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> genotype and risk of prostate cancer were estimated using unconditional logistic regression , with age included in all models .	6	11	None
Average weekly total <ANNO_TYPE_drug> consumption of greater than five drinks per week was associated with increased prostate cancer risk ( OR = 1.75 ; 95 % CI : 1.00–3.06 ) . When further adjusted for folate intake , MTHFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> genotype , and the multiplicative interaction between the two , the magnitude of risk was even higher ( OR = 3.22 ; 95 % CI : 1.36–7.59 ) .	3	39	None
Our results for the CT and TT MTHFR genotypes were null , although the ORs below one that we observed are consistent with one meta-analysis ( Bai et al. , ) , while another shows no association between the MTHFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism and prostate cancer risk ( Collin et al. , ) . Although this is a relatively small study that lacked power to detect most interactions , our finding of an over two-fold increase in prostate cancer risk for the interaction of low folate and high <ANNO_TYPE_drug> intake is consistent biologically with prostate carcinogenesis resulting from folate deficiency ( Bistulfi et al. , ) .	87	40	None

IL-1β and IL-6 transcripts were also increased by short-term treatment with lapatinib in SkBr3 and MDA-MB-231 cells ( Additional file : <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and S3B ) and were reduced in response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> withdrawal in SkBr3/Lap # 6 and 231/Lap # 2 cells ( Additional file : Figure S3C and S3D ) .	32 33	21 22	None
More recently , in addition to other second-site mutations associated with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs ( e.g. , L747S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 19 or T854A in exon 21 ) , novel EGFR independent mechanisms have been discovered that contribute to EGFR TKI resistance either in the absence or presence of the EGFR T790M mutation reviewed in .

Comparisons between <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and C57BL mice also revealed that the circadian rhythm of retinal dopamine damped out in DD in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> strain , but not in C3H , a finding that also indicates a requirement of melatonin for the stable maintenance of peripheral cycling [ ] .	21	2	None

Analyses adjusted for age and ethnicity were conducted with all premenopausal women , and separately for the subset of luteal phase women with additional adjustment for the number of days from blood draw to start of menses ( Geometric mean hormone levels among premenopausal Asian-American women by place of birtha ) . Among the entire premenopausal group , no significant differences with regard to place of birth were observed for the oestrogens , with levels of E1 , E2 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and per cent free E2 each less than 5 % lower in Western-born women .	37 38	125	None

We show that the two <ANNO_TYPE_drug> residues of the motif H212EXXH ( B. licheniformis BlaR1 numbering ) effectively coordinate a Zinc ion and are essential for cytoplasmic signalling . The observed non-inducible β-lactamase phenotype , the conservation of the Zinc binding capacity and the loss of self-proteolysis exhibited by H ( E213A ) XXH mutant are in agreement with a glutamic acid residue acting as catalytic residue and a peptidase activity of L3 loop .

Second , if an enzyme-AMP intermediate is formed during catalysis , one would expect to see the accumulation of this intermediate if the substrate is not adenylylation competent , for example , in the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant of Cdc42 . Furthermore , our attempts to capture an enzyme-AMP intermediate by soaking IbpAFic2 crystals in ATP containing solutions were not successful ( data not shown ) . Although we are still not certain about the nature and function of the auto-adenylylation , the structural information we have obtained strongly suggests that the highly conserved <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the HPFx ( D/E ) GN ( G/K ) R motif functions as a general base during catalysis .	95	37	None

The Y93H resistance mutation was modelled in the 3FQQ dimer and , while some of the possible histidine side-chain conformations did not impact on the binding of BMS-790052 , other conformations of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> side-chain prevented BMS-790052 from binding as deeply into the cleft compared to wild type NS5A ( as illustrated in ) . In the 1ZH1 NS5A dimer model Y93H is flanked on either side by T56 and G33 ( both from the same NS5A monomer as Y93H ) , and an interaction between Y93H and T56 should not impact on the binding of BMS-790052 . For genotype 1b ( con1 ) , the common <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation confers 23-fold resistance against BMS-790052 in replicon assays , whereas in the MST in vitro assay there was no detectable binding of the inhibitor to the L31V NS5A26–20 mutant .	33	107	None

Type I classical cadherins , which also include N-cadherin , P-cadherin , and VE-cadherin , possess a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( HAV ) motif within the terminal EC repeat of the extracellular domain which is an essential cell adhesion recognition sequence [ ] . Although there is some controversy surrounding the precise function of distinct regions of E-cadherin in cell-cell adhesion , many studies have shown the HAV domain , located on residues 79–81 of the EC1 domain , to play a key role in its adhesive function by forming a hydrophobic pocket into which a Tryptophan residue 2 (Trp2) from an adjacent E-cadherin molecule can dock . Mutations of Trp2 and the alanine residue of the HAV domain , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and A80I , respectively , have been shown to abolish trans- but not cis-homodimerisation of E-cadherin molecules , thus demonstrating the key roles of these amino acids in the formation of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell contact [ ] .	17	118	None
The DBL3X domain of VAR2CSA ( accession codes AY372123 and AAQ73926 ) was cloned from A4 strain genomic DNA with a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> residue tag at the N-terminus as described in Ref. .

Three of the four <ANNO_TYPE_drug> replacements at 28-HxGH-31 altered the profile for FMN binding , now driven by a very low enthalpic contribution and a favourable entropic driving force . The thermodynamic profile for the interaction of FAD was similar for all the variants . It is remarkable that in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , the effect on the thermodynamic parameters was opposite for the interaction with either FMN or FAD , suggesting that in this variant , the overall mode of interaction and the residues involved in their binding might differ .	4	50	None
In addition , we found that alanine or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> substitutions for arginine at residue 204 ( R204A or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) eliminated binding of mAb502 , and an alanine substitution for aspartic acid at residue 142 ( D142A ) decreased binding ( See ) .	8	18	None

PIK3CA is a well-known oncogene and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is in a known cancer associated mutation hotspot within the kinase domain . This mutation has been shown to be an activating mutation both experimentally and computationally . Histidine-1047 is located close to the activation loop and the change from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to leucine results in loss of interactions with the activation loop making it more flexible .	47	6	None
Mutation S143G created a rearrangement in loop 130–140 , altering the conformation and charge distribution of antigenic site Ca2 by hindering <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> residue located at the tip of the loop .

When we mutated one of the iron binding <ANNO_TYPE_drug> residues to an alanine ( Alkbh1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and tested it for activity with cBH and cH2A the iron binding mutant totally abolished release of CO2 to background levels , confirming that the dioxygenase domain is required for activity .	8	15	None
With the Y461H substitution , the most notable difference is at the site of the mutated residue where the azole interaction with Y461 is lost due to its change to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The inclusion of Y461H in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> Y461H results in residue Y123 being closer to all the docked azoles ( & lt ; 3 Å ) whilst Y137 and Y459 also remain close .	30	37	None

Replacement of cysteine in both N10K and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , that hampers disulphide bond formation , determined the most significant reduction of candidacidal activity , followed by substitution of positively charged residues ( lysine in N10K , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and arginine in T11F ) .	36	7	None
As aforementioned , the RMSD values of the ligand in R28C and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants were greater than 4 , which was two times larger than that of wild type .

The fact that these strains do not display a His+ phenotype ( Figure , rows 2 , 5 , 7 and 9 , −His ) probably reflects a combination of their Slg− phenotypes ( evident on +His medium ) and the relatively moderate increases in UUG initiation they confer ( Figure ) , but it might also involve a defect in another function required for growth under conditions <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> limitation .

The sections were deparaffinized by immersion in xylene for 20 min , and then dropped into <ANNO_TYPE_drug> solution at decreasing concentrations ( 100 % , 95 % , 90 % and 80 % ) , for 5 min each . The sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin . Histopathological changes of the pancreas were viewed and micro graphed under a phase contrast microscope with an attached photograph machine ( Nikon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , Tokyo , Japan ) .	16	72	None
The clinical characteristics of the previously described cohort of 162 subjects carrying homozygous HFE <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation are displayed in ; , . Most patients were males and harbored a significantly higher risk to develop liver cirrhosis than females ( p & lt ; 0.0001 ) . Only a minority of patients had significant <ANNO_TYPE_drug> consumption .	53	14	None
