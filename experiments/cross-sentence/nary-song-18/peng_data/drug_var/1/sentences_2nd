Our results revealed that the effectiveness of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in cells is largely affected by not only on its direct binding affinity with EGFR but also on the presence of an additional molecule , Mig6 . According to recent reports , the sensitivity to kinase inhibition reflects intrinsic differences in the binding affinity of the EGFR mutants such as L858R , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and exon19 deletions [ , - ] .	7	60	sensitivity

It was reported that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation enhances <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity due to a structural change in the kinase domain resulting in an increased binding affinity of gefitinib for its ATP binding pocket in vitro [ ] .	8	5	sensitivity
It was reported that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation enhances gefitinib sensitivity due to a structural change in the kinase domain resulting in an increased binding affinity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for its ATP binding pocket in vitro [ ] .	26	5	sensitivity
Based on these observations , we speculated that other unknown factors affect <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity in vivo rather than alteration of the binding affinity . So far , cells with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated EGFR have been reported to have two characteristics .	12	30	sensitivity
However , no mechanistic explanation has been found for the contributions of these molecules to the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	16	20	sensitivity
To obtain a logical understanding of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity associated with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , the mathematical analysis of the EGFR signaling pathway should be more preferable rather than sole experimental representations .	7	11	sensitivity
In this study , we used experimental and computational approaches to investigate regulatory mechanisms that distinguish cell-specific <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity in H1299 human NSCLC cell lines . We have modified the existing kinetic model of the EGFR signaling pathway and built new models for H1299 wild type ( H1299WT ) , H1299 with overexpressed wild type EGFR ( H1299EGFR-WT ) , and H1299 overexpressing the EGFR with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( H1299L858R ) .	17	66	sensitivity
Overexpression of wild type EGFR induced high and sustained phosphorylation of EGFR , Shc , MEK ( mitogen activated protein kinase kinase ) and ERK ( extracellular signal regulated kinase ) , while the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation reduced these response levels . In addition , H1299L858R , which is supposed to be more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than H1299EGFR-WT , was effectively inhibited by gefitinib administration at the downstream part of the signaling pathway ( MEK and ERK ) compared with H1299EGFR-WT , but , surprisingly , not at the upstream part of the pathway ( EGFR and Shc ) .	54	34	sensitivity

The inhibitory effects of Mig6 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are indicated by red lines . E11 : EGFR homodimer ; ShcP : free phosphorylated Shc ; E11P : phosphorylated EGFR homodimer ; Raf1A : activated Raf1 ; MEKP : singly phosphorylated MEK ; MEKPP : doubly phosphorylated MEK ; ERKP : singly phosphorylated ERK ; ERKPP : doubly phosphorylated ERK . To investigate cell-specific EGFR signaling dynamics , we constructed an H1299WT model ( WT model ) , an H1299EGFR-WT model ( EGFR-WT model ) , and two alternate H1299L858R models ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A with Mig6 overexpression and L858R model B with Cbl overexpression ) .	6	90	sensitivity
The results indicate that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A , including Mig6 , successfully reproduced the inhibitory effect for ERK at higher concentrations of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , whereas model B , which included the effect of Cbl , failed to reproduce this response .	23	5	sensitivity
We confirmed that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A with other parameter sets that have similar cost function values yields the same trends with regard to the role of Mig6 in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity ( data not shown ) .	28	3	sensitivity
Also , we found that EGFR-WT model at lower concentrations of EGF is as sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for ERK phosphorylation as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A ( data not shown ) .	16	21	sensitivity
The <ANNO_TYPE_drug> effect was simulated by multiplying the kinetic parameter of k3 ( the rate constant for the forward reaction of EGFR phosphorylation ) . The multiplying coefficient α is given by α = ( k3 ) / ( k3 in EGFR-WT model <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> models ) .	1	43 44	sensitivity
The multiplying coefficient α is given by α = ( k3 ) / ( k3 in EGFR-WT model <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> models ) . α = 1 means <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	27 28	18 19	sensitivity
As a result , the combination of a lower k3 ( the rate constant for the forward reaction of the EGFR phosphorylation ) and k8 ( the rate constant for the forward reaction of binding of EGFR to Shc ) contributed to effectively inhibit the total phosphorylation of ERK in the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Figure ) . The values in each panel indicate RShc/RERK calculated by using the values of parameters in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A for two changing parameters and those in EGFR-WT model for two unchanging parameters .	53	73	sensitivity
When RY is defined as the ratios of Y with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to Y without gefitinib , Figure shows RE11P/ShcP/Grb2/SOS/RY by varying the values of k3 and k8 ( Y : RasGTP , Raf1A , MEKP , MEKPP , ERKP , and ERKPP ) . The values in each panel indicate RE11P/ShcP/Grb2/SOS/RY calculated by using the values of k3 and k8 in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A and k5 and k7 in EGFR-WT model .	10	61	sensitivity

The combination of Mig6 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has a synergistic effect in inhibiting EGFR signaling The only difference between the EGFR-WT model and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A is in the negative EGFR regulation produced by Mig6 , therefore , which can be experimentally verified by overexpressing Mig6 .	5	23	sensitivity
Our results revealed that the effectiveness of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in cells is largely affected by not only on its direct binding affinity with EGFR but also on the presence of an additional molecule , Mig6 . According to recent reports , the sensitivity to kinase inhibition reflects intrinsic differences in the binding affinity of the EGFR mutants such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , G719S , and exon19 deletions [ , - ] .	7	58	sensitivity
Yun et al [ ] showed that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> directly binds more tightly to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant than to the wild type EGFR in vitro , while Fabian et al [ ] indicated that EGFR with gefitinib sensitive mutations does not differ from wild type EGFR in terms of gefitinib binding affinity .	7	14	sensitivity

Therefore , Mig6 could be one of the critical factors to explain <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity at cellular level . We constructed the model by referring to the earlier studies on Mig6 functions [ - ] . However , the model could be modified and improved when novel mechanism of Mig6 in the regulation of EGFR or new regulators associated with the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation are identified by further studies .	12	61	sensitivity
Further analyses in other studies have also revealed that clinical factors ( Asians , females , non-smokers , and adenocarcinoma histology ) are associated with the response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment [ ] . EGFR mutations , such as the deletion of exon 19 and the single <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 21 , have also been reported to be correlated with a longer survival and were found more frequently in Asian patients [ - ] .	28	46	sensitivity

These <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation seemed to be the cause of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance .	9	1	resistance or non-response

Patients who had progressed on erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were given afatinib and cetuximab , a monoclonal antibody against EGFR . Approximately 94 % of patients , regardless of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation status , had a partial response or stable disease .	7	28	resistance or non-response
In adenocarcinoma tumor samples from never smokers , a Memorial Sloan Kettering group similarly identified EGFR mutations that were associated with sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib . These EGFR mutations activate the EGFR signaling pathway that promotes survival , and commonly include exon 19 deletions or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation on exon 21 .	23	47	sensitivity
At present , there are insufficient data to treat patients with tumours having classical activating exon 19 or 21 mutations that coexist with exon 20 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations differently than patients without exon 20 mutations . Physicians should be aware that the detection of resistance mutation may herald the development of clinical resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib .	53	25	resistance or non-response
These missense ( G719S/C and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and deletion mutations ( in the region spanning codons 746-759 ) are located in exons 18 through 21 of EGFR and appear to confer tumor susceptibility to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] .	34	5	sensitivity
There was no patient whose tumor revealed the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 20 , and all 54 patients were enrolled in the study . The demographic information of the patients is summarized in Table . As expected , some imbalances were observed between the treatment groups ; more never-smokers ( 73 % vs. 41 % ) and patients with adenocarcinoma histology ( 95 % vs. 50 % ) were in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> group .	71	8	resistance or non-response
More than 90 % of these mutations are observed in two hotspots : in-frame deletions including amino acids at codons 747 to 749 in exon 19 , and an amino acid substitution at codon 858 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 21 [ - ] . These mutations are postulated to mediate oncogenic effects by altering downstream signaling and anti-apoptotic mechanisms [ - ] . Prior trials confirmed that the response rate to EGFR-TKI in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations is approximately 70–80 % [ , , ] , and results of recent phase III trials showed that the oral <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has a superior progression-free survival ( PFS ) to standard chemotherapy as the first-line therapy for NSCLC with mutated EGFR [ , ] .	99 100	36	sensitivity
In exon 21 , a missense point mutation substitutes an amino acid at position 858 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . All such mutations result in conformational changes that lead to increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors . These results indicate that screening of patients for EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations before treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or other EGFR inhibitors may predict the clinical benefit of the treatment .	52	16	sensitivity
The response rate in the 23 patients treated by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> after chemotherapy was 74 % ( 95 % CI : 56–92 % ) . When patients were stratified by EGFR mutation types , response rates were 75 % ( 15 out of 20 patients ) for exon 19 deletions , and 86 % ( six out of seven patients ) for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	9	61	sensitivity
There were also no significant differences in survival time after the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment between the patients with exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( Kaplan–Meier , logrank : P & lt ; 0.455 ) .	11	21	sensitivity
In contrast to previous retrospective analyses ( ; ) , patients with exon 19 deletions were equally responsive compared to those with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in this study . This might be due to our small sample size , so these data need to be confirmed in a larger trial . In EGFR mutation positive patients treated by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , TTP ( 9.4 months ) of after the gefitinib treatment and MST ( 19.1 months ) after the initial treatment were longer than in patients treated with the regimens using platinum doublet .	56	22	sensitivity

Unfortunately , the EGFR TKI-driven improvement in patient outcome is notably limited because virtually all NSCLC patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitizing EGFR mutations eventually acquire resistance after a median of 6–12 months of EGFR TKI therapy . In approximately half of cases , the tumor cells present after disease progression contain second-site mutations that alter drug binding to the EGFR TK domain . The most common lesion ( & gt ; 90 % ) is the so-called “gatekeeper mutation , ” which involves a substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	18	91 92	resistance or non-response

Intense research efforts over the past few years have identified two major mechanisms of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> : secondary resistance mutations ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and “oncogene kinase switch” systems ( e.g. , MET amplification and AXL activation ) .	17	25	resistance or non-response
While preparing this manuscript , Cortot et al. reported that PC-9 derived clones with acquired resistance to mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors and irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors in the absence of EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> demonstrate a significantly activated IGF-1R signaling , and pharmacological inhibition of IGF-1R restored sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors . Despite no patient data supporting the role of IGF-1R in acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , we are beginning to accumulate evidence from preclinical models indicating that clinical trials of IGF-1R inhibitors with demonstrated activity in unselected NSCLC patients might play a role in association with EGFR inhibitors in the management of NSCLCs with acquired resistance to gefitinib/erlotinib .	62	30	resistance or non-response

More recently , Chang et al. confirmed that in the absence of the common second-site EGFR mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or MET amplification , acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> occurs in EGFR mutated PC9 cells that have undergone EMT .	25	17	resistance or non-response
Earlier studies have suggested an active involvement of EMT in resistance to EGFR TKIs , and accordingly , E-cadherin expression has been reported to operate as a biomarker capable of predicting the clinical efficacy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . However , it should be noted that these studies were largely based on NSCLC cells expressing wild-type EGFR ; therefore , these studies did not mimic clinical usage of EGFR TKIs because EGFR wild-type NSCLC cells are intrinsically resistant to EGFR TKIs . In this scenario , it might appear reasonable to suggest that in addition to the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , immunohistochemical and/or microarray based transcriptional profiling studies dedicated to specific alterations of EMT drivers ( e.g. , SLUG ) and/or effectors ( e.g. , vimentin ) may be helpful in monitoring for erlotinib responders and non-responders based on the loss of biomarkers associated with epithelial status and gain of biomarkers associated with mesenchymal status .	35	98	resistance or non-response
Somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase ( TK ) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are positively associated with increased sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients to the selective EGFR TK inhibitors ( TKIs ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Iressa™ ) and erlotinib ( Tarceva™ ) . Prospective trials have demonstrated an impressive ~75 % response rate for patients whose tumors harbor these mutations , which occur as either multinucleotide in-frame deletions in exon 19 ( e.g. , delE746-A750 ) or as single missense mutations ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	43	94	sensitivity

However , in patients with acquired resistance , tumor cells bearing EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> represented a minority of cells , and as such , part of the tumor may remain responsive to erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , The other signal pathway related EGFR followed the same principles .	33	12	resistance or non-response
Contrarily , a point mutation in the EGFR gene , which results in the substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , decreases the ability of erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to inhibit EGFR .	32	23	resistance or non-response
This alteration leads to increased affinity for ATP , which can then out-compete <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and/or erlotinib for binding to the receptor . Irreversible inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase are currently in development that form permanent covalent bonds to the binding domain rather than having to compete with ATP for temporary interactions . They have been shown to successfully inhibit EGFR bearing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in vitro .	13	62	resistance or non-response
Approximately 50 % of EGFR mutations consist of deletions in exon 19 , whereas 35–45 % consist of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and 5 % consist of insertions in exon 20 or the L861Q mutation – . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Iressa ) and Erlotinib ( Tarceva ) are EGFR inhibitors that are used clinically for the treatment of advanced NSCLC , primarily that with EGFR mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains – .	36	18 19	sensitivity

The most promising drug thus far has been afatinib ( BIBW2992 ; Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma , Ingelheim , Germany ) , , an ErbB family blocker with reported in vitro and in vivo activity against EGFR mutant tumors harboring exon 19 deletions , exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations and the exon 20 T790M “resistance” mutations .	9	61	sensitivity
High response rate in patients with EGFR mutations to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was confirmed in the recently published prospective phase II study ( and . In this study , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> of exon 18 showed intermediate sensitivity , suggesting the mutation-specific treatment strategy for patient care .	9	27	sensitivity
However , EGFR mutations was not a significant prognostic factor in an initial two large retrospective studies in surgically treated patients without <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment ( ; ) , although reported that patients with exon 19 deletion have significantly shorter survival than those with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , but this is not confirmed by other investigators so far .	22	43	sensitivity
We also limit our mutation search to deletions in exon 19 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , because it would be less laborious and these two are most reliable predictor for response or survival . In this way , the survival benefit of EGFR-TKIs , especially <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , should be demonstrated in future clinical trials in a defined subset of patients with lung cancer .	43	12	sensitivity
Acquired clinical resistance to EGFR-TKI was also documented in lung cancer patients , who had an EGFR mutation in exon 20 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( ) . Therefore , in this study , we first examined the effects of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib on cell proliferation of the cell lines including those originated from lung adenocarcinoma ( LADCA ) .	39	22	resistance or non-response
The other EGFR mutations , e.g. , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation on exon 20 , represent less than 10 % of all mutations , and are associated with drug resistance ( ) . Treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation Both the European Society of Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) ( ) and the American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) ( ) recommend first-line treatment with a TKI ( erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) in metastatic NSCLC bearing an activating EGFR mutation because of higher response rate , longer progression free survival ( PFS ) , and better quality of life when compared with first-line chemotherapy .	74	8	resistance or non-response
The parental MCF10a cell line showed greater resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than those with mutations in EGFR , KRAS , PI3K , BRAF and AKT ( Figure ) . Greatest sensitivity was seen within the PI3K mutated cells where IndexSUM values decreased from a relatively resistant index of 423 to 120 and 64 for the H1407R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations of PI3KCA respectively .	9	56	resistance or non-response
Greatest sensitivity was seen within the PI3K mutated cells where IndexSUM values decreased from a relatively resistant index of 423 to 120 and 64 for the H1407R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations of PI3KCA respectively . MCF10a cells were more sensitive to erlotinib ( IndexSUM = 188 ) than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( IndexSUM = 423 ) .	47	28	resistance or non-response
The PIK3CA mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> still became the most sensitive phenotype , but the effect of an AKT mutation produced a slightly more resistant phenotype ( IndexSUM = 227 ) when compared with the parental line ( IndexSUM = 188 ) . However , both showed sufficient cellular inhibition to be classed as active agents in this setting with an indexSUM & lt ; 300 representing 50 % inhibition across the range of concentrations tested [ ] . Sensitivity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , ZSTK474 and sirolimus alone and in combination on the parental MCF10a breast cancer cell line compared with isogenic clones with EGFR , KRAS and PI3K mutations .	79	3	resistance or non-response
MCF10a cells containing the PI3K mutation H1047R showed little sensitivity to single agent sirolimus , and in combination with EGFR inhibitors were still seen to be more resistant than their parental counterpart , and were more resistant than MCF10a cells containing the PIK3CA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Chou and Talalay combination indices for each cell line examined <ANNO_TYPE_drug> + ZSTK474 Erlotinib + ZSTK474 Gefitinib + Rapamycin Erlotinib + Rapamycin Gefitinib + ZSTK474 Erlotinib + ZSTK474 Gefitinib + Rapamycin Erlotinib + Rapamycin	56	43	resistance or non-response
MCF10a cells containing the PI3K mutation H1047R showed little sensitivity to single agent sirolimus , and in combination with EGFR inhibitors were still seen to be more resistant than their parental counterpart , and were more resistant than MCF10a cells containing the PIK3CA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Chou and Talalay combination indices for each cell line examined Gefitinib + ZSTK474 Erlotinib + ZSTK474 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> + Rapamycin Erlotinib + Rapamycin Gefitinib + ZSTK474 Erlotinib + ZSTK474 Gefitinib + Rapamycin Erlotinib + Rapamycin	62	43	resistance or non-response
MCF10a cells containing the PI3K mutation H1047R showed little sensitivity to single agent sirolimus , and in combination with EGFR inhibitors were still seen to be more resistant than their parental counterpart , and were more resistant than MCF10a cells containing the PIK3CA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Chou and Talalay combination indices for each cell line examined Gefitinib + ZSTK474 Erlotinib + ZSTK474 Gefitinib + Rapamycin Erlotinib + Rapamycin <ANNO_TYPE_drug> + ZSTK474 Erlotinib + ZSTK474 Gefitinib + Rapamycin Erlotinib + Rapamycin	68	43	resistance or non-response
MCF10a cells containing the PI3K mutation H1047R showed little sensitivity to single agent sirolimus , and in combination with EGFR inhibitors were still seen to be more resistant than their parental counterpart , and were more resistant than MCF10a cells containing the PIK3CA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .

Cells with PIK3CA mutations H1047R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> showed greatest single agent sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor . Interestingly , cells with these mutations also showed greater sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib than cells with the EGFR mutation ( exon 19 deletion ) , which are associated with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC .	28	6	resistance or non-response
It could be therefore be assumed that because PIK3CA mutations drive HER related receptor addiction in these cells it would make them more susceptible to RTK inhibition ( as seen here with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib ) ( Figure ) . Cells containing the PIK3CA mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> were found to be more sensitive than those with the PIK3CA mutation H1047R , suggesting that not all activating mutations found within a given gene will result in the same activity to targeted therapy .	32	45	resistance or non-response
The firstly described and the most common event responsible for resistance is the acquisition of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutation , which is found in ≈ 50 % of patients progressing after an initial response to erlotinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] .	36 37	16	resistance or non-response
In vitro studies showed that exposing EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines to a mutagen and culturing them in the presence of an EGFR-TKI , the resistant clones with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation maintained a persistent phosphorylation [ ] . Given this role of persistent EGFR signaling , many trials evaluated the intensification of EGFR inhibition through the use of drug molecules with additional activity against other receptors in the EGFR family , as the second-generation neratinib , dacomitinib and afatinib [ ] . These inhibitors are mainly different from erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for two features : each forms a covalent and irreversible attachment to the EGFR kinase domain , and each also inhibits other members of the ERBB family ( Figure ) .	90	29	resistance or non-response
Neratinib is an oral , irreversible inhibitor of both EGFR and HER2 ; in preclinical studies conducted on cell lines with both an activating EGFR mutation and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , neratinib was more effective at suppressing cell proliferation than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	39	28	resistance or non-response
The lack of efficacy could probably be related to the high concentrations of neratinib required in preclinical studies to inhibit EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and the limitations of clinical dosing . Dacomitinib Dacomitinib is an irreversible EGFR , HER2 and HER4 inhibitor with a higher kinase inhibition than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in both gefitinib/erlotinib-sensitive and in EGFR-T790M and HER2 mutated cell lines [ ] .	46	21	resistance or non-response

Dacomitinib Dacomitinib is an irreversible EGFR , HER2 and HER4 inhibitor with a higher kinase inhibition than gefitinib/erlotinib in both <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and in EGFR-T790M and HER2 mutated cell lines [ ] .	49	21	resistance or non-response
In 2004 , EGFR gene mutations were firstly identified : classical activating EGFR mutations are localized in exon 19 , mainly consisting of an in-frame deletion ( 45-50 % ) , and in exon 21 , consisting of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation ( 40-45 % ) , even if there are less common mutations localized in other exons [ – ] . Since their identification , it was clear that EGFR mutations , more frequently observed in never smokers , adenocarcinoma histology , women and Asiatic patients , outline a distinct subgroup of NSCLC . During the last years , six phase III trials ( Table ) established that patients harboring activating EGFR mutations benefit more from a first line treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , such as erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , than from standard chemotherapy , at least in terms of response rate ( RR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) and quality of life [ – ] .	135	39	sensitivity
In vitro studies showed that exon 19 deleted mutants and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant receptors appear to be more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition as compared to wild type receptors [ , ] .	19	10	sensitivity
Patients with exon 19 harboring deletions were found to have longer survival following treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib compared with those having <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in NSCLC [ , ] ; however , Marks et al. reported no difference in survival between exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations in the absence of EGFR targeted therapy [ ] .	15	22	sensitivity

For analysis of EGFR gene mutations in exon 19 ( delE746-A750 ) or exon 21 ( L858R ) , the peptic nucleic acid locked nucleic acid ( PNA-LNA ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) clamp method was adopted , using protocols described previously . The EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was examined in cell-free DNA obtained from plasma of the patients , since no biopsy specimens for DNA analysis could be obtained because of difficult accessibility of tumors during or after EGFR-TKI-treatment .	28	88	resistance or non-response
In particular , epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , have been developed as a novel treatment option for patients with non–small cell lung cancers ( NSCLCs ) that possess somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene – . Prospective clinical trials of EGFR-TKI treatment in NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations , such as delE746-A750 ( exon 19 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( exon 21 ) , have demonstrated high clinical response rates of approximately 80 % – .	16	79	sensitivity

In contrast to patients with EGFR‐mutation‐positive tumors , patients with KRAS‐mutant NSCLC are unlikely to respond <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib and do not have an improved progression‐free survival ( PFS ) compared with those who have placebo following erlotinib therapy . Dacomitinib ( PF‐00299804 ) is a potent , irreversible , oral small‐molecule inhibitor of HER1/EGFR , HER2 , and HER4 tyrosine kinases with antitumor activity in both gefitinib‐sensitive and gefitinib‐resistant , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , preclinical NSCLC models .	16 17	73 74	resistance or non-response
One possibility is that the passage of time or cytotoxic chemotherapy may have reduced the number of clones containing modified genes and proteins that confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The mechanism of this phenomenon may involve a second point-mutation , resulting in a threonine-to-methionine amino acid change at position 790 of EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ , ] , mutation in the KRAS protein [ ] , or upregulation of epithelial membrane protein-1 [ ] .	27	53	resistance or non-response
Furthermore , the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation is a predictor of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity in lung cancer ( , ) . Thus , early detection of the EGFR mutation rate and its associated factors in lung tumors may present an important reference to individualize clinical treatment and improve treatment implementation in lung cancer , as well as to reduce the toxicity of drugs . EGFR gene mutations , including delE746-A750 , delL747-p753inss , delL747-T75linss , delL747-S752ins , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L858R , have been identified in NSCLC patients .	14	79	resistance or non-response

Somatic activating mutations of the EGFR gene have been identified as a major determinant of the clinical response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib in patients with NSCLC . Most of these mutations occur in exons 19 to 21 , which encode the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor , the most common being deletions in exon 19 ( such as delE746-A750 ) and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in exon 21 .	28	72	sensitivity
Prospective clinical trials of EGFR-TKI treatment for NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations , such as delE746-A750 ( exon 19 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( exon 21 ) , have demonstrated high clinical response rates of approximately 80 % – . In the IPASS study comparing <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with carboplatin and paclitaxel as the first-line therapy in Asian patients , NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation had a higher response rate than patients without EGFR mutations when they received carboplatin and paclitaxel .	45	22	sensitivity
Preclinical data suggest less favorable responses to reversible TKIs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib ) . These exon 20 insertions were also found to be far less sensitive to irreversible TKIs ( neratinib and afatinib ) when compared to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and exon 19 mutations [ ] .	10	38	sensitivity
These exon 20 insertions were also found to be far less sensitive to irreversible TKIs ( neratinib and afatinib ) when compared to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and exon 19 mutations [ ] . In clinical settings , the reported response to reversible TKIs ( both <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib ) remains inconstant .	43	23	sensitivity
In the Taiwanese population , the treatment response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was found to be 25 % , which was much lower when compared to exon 19 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations .	9	27	sensitivity
The coexisting point mutations on exon 20 that rendered the patients resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were G719A , V769L , W731 Stop , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , L 861Q and delE749_T751insVA [ ] .	13	22	sensitivity
Second-generation EGFR TKIs – such as neratinib , afatinib and dacomitinib – are effective in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> models , but to date their delivery in EGFR TKI-resistant patients have shown disappointing results in the clinic .	15 16	19 20	resistance or non-response
Erlotinib is an orally bioavailable EGFR inhibitor , which is indicated for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) substitution mutations [ • ] . The drug is also approved as maintenance therapy in patients whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum containing first-line therapy . Evaluation of the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors , including erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , in patients with brain metastases from NSCLC comes from case reports , case series , and small prospective clinical trials [ ] .	73	30	sensitivity
Furthermore , the biopsy of the breast metastasis revealed the second mutation of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	15	25	resistance or non-response
In our case , a biopsy ( ‘re-biopsy’ ) revealed <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the EGFR gene , which was widely known as a second mutation resistant to EGFR TKIs , such <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib .	32 33	10 11	resistance or non-response
Of note , according to our case , CBDCA + pemetrexed + bevacizumab and its maintenance chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated for solitary breast metastasis from a lung adenocarcinoma which is resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and possesses the secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the EGFR gene .	34	39	resistance or non-response
Median progression-free survival ( PFS ) following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment was 11 months , and the median overall survival ( OS ) time was 32.3 months . PFS was significantly better in patients with secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation than in those without T790M ( p = 0.009 , Figure ) , while OS was not statistically different ( p = 0.617 , Figure ) .	7	34	resistance or non-response
Other possible resistance mechanisms , specifically PIK3CA mutation and conversion to wild-type EGFR were noted in some cases , although PIK3CA mutation concomitantly occurred with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . In a previous in vitro study , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced apoptosis was abrogated when PIK3CA mutation was introduced in HCC827 cells with a deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR gene [ ] .	35	25	resistance or non-response
The deletion mutation on exon 19 of EGFR gene was present in 16 patients ( 61.5 % ) , while the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation on exon 21 was noted in 10 ( 38.5 % ) . All patients were treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and showed a partial response .	41	21	sensitivity
Patients who carry these mutations in EGFR tend to have a better response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , an EGFR-TKI , whereas patients with the wild-type genotype show a better response to conventional chemotherapy [ ] . This could be explained by the fact that the mutated receptor possess a greater affinity to the drug in comparison with ATP , and therefore can not initiate the phosphorylation cascade downstream through the signaling pathways that lead to proliferation and cell survival . However , about 50 % of lung cancer patients treated with EGFR-TKI acquire a secondary mutation that confers drug resistance , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( C2369G ; ID : rs121434569 ) , located in exon 21 of the gene , which reduces the affinity of the ATP binding site for the drug [ ] .	14	101	resistance or non-response
The most frequent EGFR mutations are deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation in codon 858 of exon 21 , known as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( T2573G ; ID : rs121434568 ) [ ] . Patients who carry these mutations in EGFR tend to have a better response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , an EGFR-TKI , whereas patients with the wild-type genotype show a better response to conventional chemotherapy [ ] .	48	23	sensitivity

It is well known that the efficacy of targeted therapies such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib with NSCLC patients depends on the presence of EGFR activating mutations including in-frame deletion in exon 19 or L858R in exon 21 [ – ] . However , many patients acquire resistance to EGFR-TKI , which occurs within 9.5 to 14 months [ – ] . A second EGFR mutation , substitution of threonine 790 with methionine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , was detected in approximately 50 % of the patients who had acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI [ ] .	12	73	resistance or non-response

Approximately 90 % of all activating mutations are exon 19 deletions and a point mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 21 . At present , although it is recommended that the presence of activating mutations in the EGFR gene should be identified before treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , there is no consensus regarding the specific mutations that should be tested nor methods that should be used .	45	16	sensitivity
Only one sample had a KRAS codon 61 mutation , and there were no exon 19 deletions or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in EGFR . However , amplifications of EGFR were found in 7 % of cases as were two instances of the L861Q EGFR mutation , which confers sensitivity to erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	51	18	sensitivity
Introduction : Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are one of gold standard treatment options for non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients , which eventually fail due to the acquired resistance and relapse because of the development of secondary activating mutations such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR .	15	52	resistance or non-response
Furthermore , the identified L862R EGFR mutation , although not reported before , was located near mutations known to be sensitive to EGFR-TKI , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L861X . Therefore , the tumor clone bearing this EGFR mutation could have been potentially responsive to EGR-TKI therapy . However , a previously described single case of L862V EGFR mutation was associated with lack of response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and the same could have been the scenario with the L862R EGFR mutation .	66	26	sensitivity
The commonest mutation was del exon 19 ( 62 % ) , followed by <ANNO_TYPE_variant> exon 21 ( 25 % ) , G719X exon 18 ( 7 % ) and insertion exon 20 ( 3 % ) . Patients were treated either with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or chemotherapy .	43	14	sensitivity
For example , patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations , most frequently exon 19 deletions and exon 21 point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> may respond to EGFR–TKI , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib .	28 29	22	sensitivity
In this study , we report that BMS-690514 has in vivo efficacy on a panel of NSLCC xenografts , including those with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations , conferring resistance to EGFR therapies such as Erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	34	22	resistance or non-response
The F1245C mutation corresponds to L833V in EGFR , a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mutation in lung cancer ( Greulich & amp ; Meyerson , unpublished observations ) .

Although several previous studies have suggested that tumors harboring mutations in the EGFR kinase domain were sensitive to TKIs such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , others had reported an association between the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 20 and the resistance to TKIs .	21	32	resistance or non-response

H1975 cells also contained the exon 20 C→T mutation at nucleotide position 2,369 . This change leads to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 ( T790M ) and is associated with acquired resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	65	23 24	sensitivity
Specifically , we examined the relationship between levels of phospho-EGFR and Bim in tumors induced in transgenic mice that conditionally express mutant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFRs in lung epithelial cells under the control of tetracycline regulation [ ] .

Some 90 % of NSCLC associated mutations occur as either multi-nucleotide in-frame deletions in exon 19 , involving elimination of four amino acids , Leu-Arg-Glu-Ala , or as a single nucleotide substitution at nucleotide 2573 ( T→G ) in exon 21 , resulting in substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . Both of these mutations are associated with sensitivity to the small-molecule kinase inhibitors gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , , ] .	71	52 53	sensitivity
Collectively , these findings imply that the exon 20 T790M mutation was present on the same allele as the exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , and that a subclone of cells harboring these mutations emerged during drug treatment .

Specific mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR are associated with sensitivity to either gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , but mechanisms of acquired resistance have not yet been reported . Based upon analogous studies in other diseases with another kinase inhibitor , imatinib , a single amino acid substitution from threonine to methionine at position 790 in the wild-type EGFR kinase domain was predicted to lead to drug resistance , even before the association of exon 19 and 21 mutations of EGFR with drug responsiveness in NSCLC was reported .

Sequencing Chromatograms with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR Exon 20 Mutation in Various Clinical Specimens and the NSCLC Cell Line H1975 ( A–C ) In all three patients—patient 1 ( A ) , patient 2 ( B ) , and patient 3 ( C ) —the secondary T790M mutation was observed only in lesions obtained after progression on either gefitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	58 59	4	resistance or non-response
EGFR Mutants Containing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> Mutation Are Resistant to Inhibition by Gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type ( WT ) EGFR or EGFR mutants with the following changes : T790M , L858R , L858R + T790M , del L747–E749 ; A750P , or del L747–E749 ; A750P + T790M .	13	4	resistance or non-response
After 36 h , cells were serum starved for 24 h , treated with gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for 1 h , and then harvested for immunoblot analysis using anti-p-EGFR ( Y1092 ) , anti-t-EGFR , anti-phosphotyrosine ( p-Tyr ) , and anti-actin antibodies as described in Methods . The EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , in conjunction with either wild-type EGFR or the drug-sensitive L858R EGFR mutant , prevents inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation ( A ) or p-EGFR ( B ) by gefitinib .	16	50	resistance or non-response
Analogously , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , in conjunction with the drug-responsive del L747–E749 ; A750P EGFR mutant , prevents inhibition of p-EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( C ) .	22 23	3	resistance or non-response
We found that the mechanism of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance of HCC827TR3 was neither c-Met amplification nor <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR ( data not shown ) .	6	15	resistance or non-response
By using two types of tumor models , we were able to investigate the mechanism by which NSCLC and pancreatic cancer become resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Although EBC-1 and H1975 show amplification of c-Met and mutation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , respectively , HCC827TR3 , which was established in-house , has neither .	24	37	resistance or non-response
On the other hand , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> could not inhibit EGFR phosphorylation in H1975 cells because the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR causes a conformation change at the ATP binding pocket , thus decreasing the affinity between erlotinib and EGFR .	5	16	resistance or non-response
On the other hand , erlotinib could not inhibit EGFR phosphorylation in H1975 cells because the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR causes a conformation change at the ATP binding pocket , thus decreasing the affinity between <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and EGFR .	35	16	resistance or non-response
Gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> represent the first generation of small EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) that selectively target the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR , blocking the downstream signaling of the receptor . The EGFR somatic mutations have emerged to be the most relevant predictor of response to these agents. , Thus , several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that the use of EGFR TKIs in patients with advanced treatment-naive NSCLC with EGFR mutations significantly improved the objective response rate ( ORR ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) compared with standard platinum based chemotherapy.– Unfortunately , all responders eventually develop resistance , most commonly because of the emergence of a gatekeeper mutation in the kinase domain , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR mutated NSCLC or amplification of mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor ( c-Met ) .	2	122	resistance or non-response
Otherwise , CO-1686 is a novel irreversible mutant-selective inhibitor of EGFR , able to target both the initial activating EGFR mutations as well as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary acquired resistance mutation . To investigate its use as a single agent , CO-1686 is being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients previously treated with first-line gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( NCT01526928 ) .	59	25	resistance or non-response
It has been shown that exon 19 deletions are more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition than the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , a finding demonstrated by kinetic analysis [ ] and also confirmed in clinical studies [ - ] .	12	16	sensitivity
The most commonly identified mechanism of resistance is an EGFR mutation at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , resulting in substitution of a threonine residue with methionine , which abrogates the ability of gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to inhibit EGFR [ , ] .	35	15	resistance or non-response
The majority of activating mutations are of 3 dominant types , deletions in exon 19 , insertions in exon 20 or a single point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . More recent data have focused on patients with known mutations in EGFR who initially respond and subsequently become resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	47	25	sensitivity
The best therapy for those who have initially responded to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and have subsequently lost their response either through development of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or another resistance mechanism , remains another area of active research .	10	22	resistance or non-response
Resistance due to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> can potentially overcome by second generation irreversible EGFR TKIs , which appear to be well tolerated in early clinical studies [ ] . Although did not demonstrated an overall survival benefit , Afatinib , an irreversible EGFR , Her-2 , and ErbB4 blocker has led to significant PFS in patients who progressed after a 12 week course of Gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> when compared to placebo in a phase 2b/3 trial [ ] .	64	3	resistance or non-response

The other EGFR mutations , e.g. , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation on exon 20 , represent less than 10 % of all mutations , and are associated with drug resistance ( ) . Treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation Both the European Society of Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) ( ) and the American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) ( ) recommend first-line treatment with a TKI ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib ) in metastatic NSCLC bearing an activating EGFR mutation because of higher response rate , longer progression free survival ( PFS ) , and better quality of life when compared with first-line chemotherapy .	72	8	resistance or non-response
For neratinib , a phase II trial showed disappointing results ( ) and the dacomitinib data showed possible benefit in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance ( ) , but further investigations are necessary . In preclinical studies , third-generation EGFR inhibitors ( WZ4002 and CO-1686 ) showed hopeful results , with activity against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations and sparing wild-type EGFR ( – ) .	22	52	resistance or non-response
In pre-clinical studies , neratinib inhibited the growth of NCI-H1975 bronchoalveolar cancer cells harboring both substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and T790M and cell lines harboring the HER2 mutation [ ] . A phase I study of the advanced stage of solid tumors showed that the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of neratinib was 320 mg once daily [ ] . An open-label , single-agent , phase II study revealed only a 3 % RR in patients with an EGFR mutation who had been treated with gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for more than 12 weeks .	95	24	sensitivity

However , it was demonstrated recently that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> increased the affinity of ATP to the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain ; thus , it decreased the binding of gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , because they are ATP-competitive agents [ ] .	29	7	resistance or non-response
Another retrospective study reported a small group ( 14 patients ) of patients that was heavily treated and then re-treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> after a median interval from the discontinuation of EGFR-TKI to the second episode of 9.5 months ( 3–36 months ) [ ] . The RR was 36 % ( n = 5 ) , and the disease control rate was 85.7 % ( n = 12 ) . Before beginning the re-treatment , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was detected in 36 % of patients ( five of 14 ) .	21	75	resistance or non-response
In pre-clinical studies , neratinib inhibited the growth of NCI-H1975 bronchoalveolar cancer cells harboring both substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 ( L858R ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and cell lines harboring the HER2 mutation [ ] . A phase I study of the advanced stage of solid tumors showed that the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of neratinib was 320 mg once daily [ ] .

In both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models , afatinib demonstrated increased affinity to common EGFR mutations , as well as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] . After several phase I studies [ , ] , MTD at 50 mg orally daily was established , and the LUX-Lung series of trials has shown promising results . First , the single-arm phase II trial ( LUX-Lung 4 ) , involving Japanese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma that progressed after ≥12 weeks of prior gefitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , has shown a modest effect in a third- or fourth-line setting [ ] .	83 84	23	resistance or non-response

At the molecular level , most patients with partial or complete responses to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> harbored specific mutations in the gene that encodes EGFR , located on chromosome 7p12 [ ] . Exon 19 mutations , characterized by in-frame deletions of amino-acids 747–750 , account for 45 % of mutations , exon 21 mutations , resulting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitutions , account for 40–45 % of mutations , and the remaining 10 % of mutations involve exon 18 and 20 [ - ] .	15	57 58	sensitivity
Preclinical studies have shown superior activity of afatinib over first-generation TKIs , mainly due to ( 1 ) irreversible binding , which confers stronger binding affinity and potency , ( 2 ) ability to circumvent first-generation TKI resistance mechanism <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 20 , and ( 3 ) effectiveness against multiple HER-endothelial growth factor receptors . Recently , TKIs have been investigated in eight phase 3 trials as first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR activating mutations , in comparison with platinum based chemotherapy doublets : gefitinib trials IPASS , , West Japan , North-East Japan , , and First-SIGNAL ; <ANNO_TYPE_drug> trials OPTIMAL , and EURTAC ; and afatinib trials LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 .	104	39	resistance or non-response
One of the proposed mechanisms of resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation on exon 20 .	10	13	resistance or non-response
As the theoretical advantage of afatinib versus the first-generation EGFR-TKI did not translate into progression-free survival gains , maybe the clinical relevance of possible inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is minimal , at least in the first-line setting , when T790M positive clones are rarely detected . A limitation of our study is the indirect comparison of gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and afatinib with one another , which relies on the quality of variance component estimates .	57	26	resistance or non-response
A number of effective EGFR-specific therapeutic compounds against NSCLC , with EGFR activating mutations ( exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutations ) , have been developed and approved for clinical use .

Most patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC receive an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( e.g. gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , or afatinib ) as first-line therapy , and unfortunately most patients experience disease progression after approximately 10–15 months of treatment .

Since Lynch et al. have identified specific activating mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR [ ] , the missense mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 and the in-frame deletion in exon 19 , nested around the amino acid residues 747 to 750 of the EGFR polypeptide , account for & gt ; 85 % of all clinically important mutations related to TKI sensitivity [ ] .	0	38	sensitivity
In the Zhang report , exon 19 deletion + <ANNO_TYPE_variant> double mutations were located on the same allele and the double mutant had a higher sensitivity to TKIs than the other two single activating mutation in the in vitro study . Although it remains unknown whether the double mutant shows good clinical response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , this may be the 2nd reason of the patient 's good clinical response .	54	9	sensitivity
The other with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 showed a remarkable shrinkage in the shorter axis of the measurable tumor , but did not meet the PR criteria defined by the longest axis , and the disease was also stable for longer than 6 months . Discussion Two phase I clinical trials that have investigated the safety and efficacy of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> pemetrexed combination have been reported .	60	3	sensitivity
Consequently , administrating intermittent <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with pemetrexed was shown to be safe and tolerable . When evaluated on the basis of RECIST two EGFR mutated patients did not respond in our study . However , one patient with a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 21 practically achieved a PR .	4	39	sensitivity
However , one patient with a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 21 practically achieved a PR . The other with a G719S mutation in exon 18 succeeded in maintaining a long SD , which was also practically beneficial , considering that in patients with the G719X mutation the reported RR to EGFR-TKIs was approximately 56 % [ ] . Collectively , the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and pemetrexed combination is not only well tolerated , but also attractive in terms of antitumor efficacy , regardless of EGFR mutation status .	61	6	sensitivity
Acquired clinical resistance to EGFR-TKI was also documented in lung cancer patients , who had an EGFR mutation in exon 20 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( ) . Therefore , in this study , we first examined the effects of gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> on cell proliferation of the cell lines including those originated from lung adenocarcinoma ( LADCA ) .	41	22	resistance or non-response
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> is an orally bioavailable EGFR inhibitor , which is indicated for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) substitution mutations [ • ] .	0	30	sensitivity
The deletion of the four amino acid sequence ( del 746–750 ) in the exon 19 and the substitution of leucine by arginine at codon 858 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 21 are two of the most common mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR gene in NSCLC patients [ ] . The small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors including gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> have recently been approved for the treatment of patients with NSCLC [ , - ] .	60	26 27	sensitivity
A secondary point mutation in exon 20 of EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is associated with acquired resistance to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , but this can be overcome by the irreversible EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBW2992 ( BIBW ) .	20	10	resistance or non-response
EGFR–TKIs such as gefitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> attain a response rate of approximately 70 % and progression-free survival of 9–13 months , although subgroups of patients experience long lasting remission. , Use of EGFR–TKIs as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations improved progression-free survival with acceptable toxicity , compared with standard chemotherapy . EGFR–TKIs are currently considered a standard first-line treatment for this disease entity.– However , these tumors eventually develop resistance to EGFR–TKIs , possibly as a result of a secondary threonine–methionine substitution mutation at position 790 in exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , MET amplification , or hepatocyte growth factor overexpression in relapsed tumors .	4 5	94 95 96	resistance or non-response
Lung cancers with mutations that activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) , including exon 19 deletions and the exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation , respond to the reversible EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	36	20	sensitivity
Among the mechanisms by which cancer cells become resistant to reversible EGFR-TKIs are 1 ) gatekeeper mutations in EGFR , such as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> second mutation [ , ] ; 2 ) activation of bypass signaling caused by Met amplification [ ] , hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) overexpression [ ] , or Gas6-Axl activation [ ] ; 3 ) activation of downstream molecules ( PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutation ) [ , ] ; 4 ) small-cell lung cancer transformation [ ] ; and 5 ) epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [ ] . The gatekeeper EGFR-T790M mutation is the most frequent , occurring in half of tumors with acquired resistance to reversible EGFR-TKIs . The methionine residue at position 790 generates a bulkier side chain , which enhances the affinity of the EGFR tyrosine kinase pocket with ATP [ ] , decreasing the effective binding of gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to the tyrosine kinase pocket of EGFR [ ] .	146	23	resistance or non-response
The most common mutations are an in-frame deletion in exon 19 around codons 746–750 ( 45 % –50 % of all somatic EGFR mutations ) and a missense mutation leading to leucine to arginine substitution at codon 858 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 21 ( 35 % –45 % of mutations ) [ ] . Several NSCLC cell lines lacking the above cited mutations are considered valuable models to study intrinsic resistance to the EGFR TKIs gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , such as A549 , H460 , H1299 and GLC-82 .	78	38 39	sensitivity
For tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) [ ] , mutations within the ATP pocket of the kinase domain may affect the interaction of the drug with its target : for example , the single amino acid mutation tyrosine/methionine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR mediates secondary resistance to the EGFR TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ , ] .	57	40	resistance or non-response
Through this approach , they showed that Src Family Kinases (SFKs) , as well as EGFR , are relevant targets for the Src inhibitor dasatinib and that acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations render cells resistant not only to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib , but also to dasatinib [ ] .	36	28	resistance or non-response
Further studies of gefitinib revealed that this 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor , structurally similar to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , binds the EGFR c.2573T & gt ; G ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) mutant with a 20-fold higher affinity compared to the wild-type enzyme .	13	24	sensitivity
In fact , the patient with EGFR c.2573T & gt ; G ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and EGFR c.2369C&gt ; T ( T790M ) was treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and a short-term improvement was observed .	26	13	sensitivity
Further studies of gefitinib revealed that this 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor , structurally similar to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , binds the EGFR c.2573T & gt ; G ( L858R ) mutant with a 20-fold higher affinity compared to the wild-type enzyme . Both mutations , the activating EGFR c.2573T & gt ; G ( L858R ) and the inhibiting EGFR c.2369C&gt ; T ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) were found in our cytological assessment .	13	60	resistance or non-response
In fact , the patient with EGFR c.2573T & gt ; G ( L858R ) and EGFR c.2369C&gt ; T ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) was treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and a short-term improvement was observed .	26	21	resistance or non-response
In NSCLC , approximately 85 % of patients who responded favourably to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , two FDA approved small-molecule EGFR-tyrosine-kinase inhibitors , were shown to have somatic mutations in the EGFR gene . Somatic EGFR mutations are primarily located in exons 18 through 21 around the ATP binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain [ - ] . The most common mutations are short deletions in exon 19 affecting the amino acid sequence LREA ( DelE746-A750 ) or a point mutation in exon 21 resulting in the amino acid change <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	14	91	sensitivity
NSCLC patients harboring exon 19 deletion or exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> somatic mutations experience significant tumor regression when prescribed the reversible small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) such as gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	32	9	sensitivity
Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) , such as gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , have achieved high clinical response rates in patients with non-small cell lung cancers ( NSCLCs ) , which possess somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene . However , over time ( median of 6-12 months ) , most tumors are known to develop acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs . Currently , there have been no effective treatment options against NSCLC patients with the secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation , which occurs in 50 % of patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs .	15	90	resistance or non-response
However , the acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of EGFR leads to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance .	10	4	resistance or non-response
EGFR was found to harbor mutations in close to 10 % of cases , and EGFR inhibitors such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> could be tested in this subset of cancers . In lung cancer , these inhibitors are used to treat cancers that harbor exon 20 variants , codon 719 variants , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitutions in addition to other types of EGFR mutations , .	19	51	sensitivity
The patient was first administered <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and maintained a good response for one year , according to the literature data ( 14 months ) ( ) . The patient then presented with a peritoneal progression and a second biopsy was planned to rule out acquired resistant EGFR mutations . A double mutation was detected , consisting of an activating mutation ( exon 19 deletion ) and an acquired resistance mutation ( exon 20 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	5	73	resistance or non-response
Only one sample had a KRAS codon 61 mutation , and there were no exon 19 deletions or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in EGFR . However , amplifications of EGFR were found in 7 % of cases as were two instances of the L861Q EGFR mutation , which confers sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib .	49	18	sensitivity
As in our study , iTARGET and EURTAC reported generally mild to moderate AEs ( rash and diarrhoea ) , although 13 % of patients ( 11 out of 84 ) in EURTAC did experience grade-3/4 rash with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( there were no grade-3/4 rash events with gefitinib reported in our study ) . Mutation subtype analysis results in iTARGET and EURTAC were also similar to our study , with exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> the most common mutation subtypes detected .	38	74	sensitivity
The first example of a clinically relevant NSCLC driver oncogene was the identification of somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene ( – ) .Common EGFR alterations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation and exon 19 deletions ) are present in 10–30 % of patients with NSCLC and confer sensitivity to gefitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and afatinib .	54 55	31 32	sensitivity
Indeed , in non-small cell lung cancers treated with gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , sensitive patients have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in only a few cells , whereas resistant patients exhibit EGFR T790M in the majority of the tumour cells ( ; ) .	11	18	resistance or non-response
The two most common genetic mutations are the in-frame deletion in exon 19 ( E746-A750 ) and the substitution of leucine 858 by arginine in the exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . These two mutations constitute about 90 % of all mutations and are known as the “classical” mutations . These two EGFR-specific mutations are strong predictors of the response to small-molecule EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	70	29	sensitivity
Initial clinical studies found that only a minority of individuals with NSCLC responded to either gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . Asian non smoking females were noted to be particularly sensitive to this class of drugs [ , ] . Soon , investigators discovered that sensitivity to these TKIs was correlated with somatic mutations of the kinase domain of EGFR , such as either deletions within exon 19 or a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 21 [ , – ] .	17	70	sensitivity
The H1975 and H820 cell lines had EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in exon 20 , associated with gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance .	18	8	resistance or non-response
PNA-LNA PCR clamp analysis of the spinal fluid revealed the same EGFR deletion mutation ; however , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation could not be detected . Thus , we administered <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to control the central nervous system metastasis .	29	18	resistance or non-response
It has been proved that somatic mutations in exons 19 or 21 are related to tumor sensitivity to therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) such as gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A higher median survival rate was observed in the case of exon deletion in exon 19 than in the case of the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 [ ] .	30	56	sensitivity
Similarly , EGFR-T790M mutant could cause resistance to Gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> drugs in the treatment of lung cancer , . Importantly , these mutations can promote oncogenic activation , uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis even in the absence of the selective pressure from the kinase inhibitors . An activating mutation in the activation loop of the EGFR kinase domain , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( also identified as Leu834 in a different numbering of the EGFR sequence ) is among most frequent mutations in lung cancer , amounting to more than 40 % of EGFR mutations in this cancer category – .	10	60	sensitivity
Similarly , the gatekeeper mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR causes resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and has been detected in lung cancer patients before drug treatment and in the germ line of a family pedigree with several cases of lung cancer , .	13	5	resistance or non-response
Finally , although molecularly targeted therapies ( that is , gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for EGFR and crizotinib for ALK fusions ) are effective in NSCLC , intrinsic or acquired resistances inevitably lead to recurrence and/or metastatic dissemination . This is the case of MET activation/amplification , , or acquired somatic mutations of EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) or ALK fusions ( G1269A , L1196M and ALK amplification ) . , ,	12	54	resistance or non-response
Grommes et al. also reported a study involving treatment of a very small group of patients ( n = 9 ) treated with pulsatile , high-dose <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with CNS metastases and with EGFR mutation diagnosed outside of CNS metastases . A partial response of CNS metastases was observed in six patients . Corresponding tissue from the CNS metastases was available for four patients with response after tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) -EGFR therapy diagnosed with EGFR mutation matching to those diagnosed outside the CNS metastases ( three <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution and one deletion in exon 19 ) [ ] .	26	88	sensitivity
Most of the mutations are in frame deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] . A deletion between codons 746 and 750 accounts for 65–75.5 % of the deletions in exon 19 [ ] . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib are compounds that reversibly inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and have been employed in the treatment of patients with NSCLC .	44	19	sensitivity
In spite of recent improvements in NSCLC management , such as the use of targeted therapy including gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which have led to improved progression-free survival and quality of life in NSCLC patients with an activating EGFR mutation , progression or metastasis because of resistance to targeted therapy remains a major clinical problem . Apart from <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and c-MET amplification , a recent study has reported that Axl kinase is upregulated in humans with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI .	19	58	resistance or non-response
H1975 cells , which also contain a second mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) linked to gefitinib resistance [ ] , responded poorly to either agent . Dose- and time dependent responses of wild-type EGFR and tyrosine kinase domain mutated EGFR cells to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib treatment .	41	10	response 
In particular , H1975 cells contain a second mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) reported to be linked to gefitinib resistance [ ] , but we found that these cells also responded poorly to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	32	10	response 
In the study by Pentheroudakis et al. , patients with a mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene who received chemotherapy combined with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> had a median overall survival of 19 months , whereas patients with other KRAS mutations and KRAS-wild type gene subjects treated with the same modality had a considerably longer median survival of nearly 30 months [ – ] . Furthermore , there are many reports on patients with the wild-type KRAS gene who are refractory to anti-EGFR treatment . The cause of refractoriness has been identified in ca. 15 % of mCRC patients as mutations in the BRAF gene , primarily <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution .	24	106	resistance or non-response
The cause of refractoriness has been identified in ca. 15 % of mCRC patients as mutations in the BRAF gene , primarily <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution . Raf family proteins are downstream of Ras proteins in the signal transduction pathway originating at EGFR . It comes as no surprise , then , that activating mutations in the BRAF gene occurring in cancer cells have a similar clinical effect to KRAS gene mutations , making them refractory both to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab [ , , – ] .	76	22	resistance or non-response
This <ANNO_TYPE_variant> allele mutation occurs in approximately 10 % of colorectal cancer patients . It is associated with microsatellite instability and poor survival of colon cancer patients. , BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer cause resistance to EGFR targeted therapy with shorter PFS and OS compared to nonmutated patients . Remarkably , treatment with the BRAF-inhibitor sorafenib in in vitro experiments restored sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in colon cancer cells .	63	1	resistance or non-response
Regarding KRAS , the same group reported in a pooled dataset of 579 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treated CRC patients that those with codon 13 KRAS mutant tumours ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) had better outcomes ( HR for death 0.50 ) compared to patients with other KRAS mutant tumours [ ] .	13	26	resistance or non-response
Such a low percentage compared with that in previous reports is probably due to the fact that after Health Authorities approval to limit the use of anti-EGFR moAb to KRAS wild-type mCRC patients , KRAS mutant cases have not received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based therapy at our Institution . KRAS mutations were as follows : G13D in five patients ; <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in three patients ; G12V in three patients ; and G12A in one patient .	40	58	sensitivity
KRAS mutations were as follows : G13D in five patients ; <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in three patients ; G12V in three patients ; and G12A in one patient . In all , 11 out of 36 KRAS wild-type patients ( 30 % ) responded to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , whereas none of the 12 patients ( 0 % ) harbouring a KRAS mutation had a partial response ( P=0.04 ) .	43	11	sensitivity

Although other mutationally activated protein kinases downstream of EGFR are being evaluated as potential biomarkers of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , so far none of them has sufficient supporting evidence to be routinely used in clinical practice . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutation is present in ∼5–10 % of CRC patients and is mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations .	18	38	resistance or non-response
It is worth noting that the presence of BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations was associated with MKP-1 overexpression in all the cases , although the number of patients was insufficient to achieve a significant correlation . Collectively , our results suggest a role for MKP-1 in predicting failure to respond to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type CRC patients .	49	9	resistance or non-response
The only B-RAF mutation found was the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution . The most important thing was that patients who received panitumumab or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> but had B-RAF alteration , presented no objective response to therapy ; consequently TTP was worse for subjects bearing a mutated B-RAF although not statistically significant probably due to the limited number of tumors carrying these mutations .	21	7	resistance or non-response
Di Nicolantonio et al also demonstrated that introduction of the B-RAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> allele could confer resistance to either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab in wild-type B-RAF colorectal cancer cells .	18	11	resistance or non-response

Furthermore , we performed highly sensitive deep sequencing for mutations in KRAS ( exon 2 ) , PIK3CA ( exons 9 and 20 ) , BRAF ( V600E ) , and EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in patients who received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) .	39	33	resistance
Recent investigations have identified genes and proteins downstream of KRAS in the mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway , which affect unresponsiveness to anti-EGFR therapy , including the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , mutations in NRAS or PIK3CA ( exons 9 and 20 ) , or loss of PTEN or AKT expression – . Furthermore , several mechanisms of acquired ( secondary ) resistance to anti-EGFR therapies , such as expression of EGFR ligands , deregulation of the EGFR recycling process , amplifications of the genes ERBB2 ( also called HER2 ) , , KRAS , , and MET , have been identified .

Multiple analyses have demonstrated that responses to either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab occur exclusively within the 60–70 % of patients without activating mutations in codon 12 and 13 of KRAS [ , , , ] . The activating <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutation is present in an additional 10 % of patients , and it may be predictive of a lack of response to anti-EGFR therapy [ ] in addition to a clear poor prognostic factor .	8	37	resistance or non-response
This is in keeping with an earlier study by Di Nicolantonio and colleagues [ ] , where the response to panitumumab or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was found to be impeded by the presence of BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and restored ( in a cellular model of CRC cells ) by BRAF inhibitor sorafenib [ ] .	22	33	resistance or non-response

In a study by De Roock et al. , a pooled data set of 579 mCRC patients across various clinical trials treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> plus/minus chemotherapy demonstrated that overall and progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> KRAS mutant tumors .	23	38	resistance or non-response
Patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> KRAS mutant tumors and treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> regimes had overall survival and progression free survival of average 7.6 and 4.0 mo vs. 5.7 and 1.9 mo in other KRAS mutant tumor subtypes .	9	2	resistance or non-response
This year at ASCO , Tejpar et al. further supported this finding by presenting retrospective analyses of two large phase III multicenter trials ( CRYSTAL and OPUS ) representing 83 patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> KRAS mutant mCRC tumors who had longer overall survival and progression free survival on average post <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment then other KRAS mutant subtypes .	49	32	resistance or non-response
Indeed , in non-small cell lung cancers treated with gefitinib or erlotinib , sensitive patients have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in only a few cells , whereas resistant patients exhibit EGFR T790M in the majority of the tumour cells ( ; ) . In conclusion , our results , which deserve a confirmation in larger ( not only retrospective ) studies , revealed that the response to anti-EGFR MoAbs may be influenced by the HER2 gene copy number status ( as detected by FISH ) in KRAS wt mCRC patients . The presence of HER2 gene amplification throughout the tumour ( HER2-all-A patients ) is associated not only with resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab but may also identify patients who could benefit from specific anti-HER2 drugs ( i.e. , trastuzumab ) or from combined EGFR/HER2 targeted agents ( i.e. , lapatinib ) ( ) .	111	18	response

The rationale of the combination lies in some preclinical work in which mice with EGFR mutated lung cancer and acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs showed tumor regression under treatment with afatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . In the clinical trial , results from the first 96 evaluable patients showed impressive objective response rate ( ORR ) and disease control rate ( DCR ; 30 % and 75 % , respectively ) . Response to treatment was observed both in patients bearing a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or other mechanisms of resistance .	32	80	response 
The new therapy methods , which could be effective in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation includes irreversible EGFR-TKIs ( afatinib , neratinib ) . In LUX-Lung 1 study in patients after failure of erlotinib or gefitinib treatment with afatinib led to partial responses and prolongation of progression-free survival compared to placebo to 3,3 months [ , ] . Recently the studies are conducted with combining of irreversible EGFR-TKI and monoclonal antibody against extracellular domain of EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	75 76	12	response 
In study conducted by Janjigian et al. all patients treated with afatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> achieved disease control , and part of them ( 36 % ) partial response . Additionally , 4 of 13 patients ( 31 % ) with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations gained confirmed partial response after combined therapy with monoclonal antibody and irreversible EGFR-TKI [ ] .	13	40	response 
Moreover , the introduction/presence of the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> allele in CRC ( DiFi-BRAF , COLO-205 and HT-29 ) cell lines impaired the therapeutic potential of anti-EGFR moAbs . Thus , in the clinical setting , the therapeutic effect of anti-EGFR moAbs could be restored by a two-hit approach that blocks the EGFR pathway in multiple locations . In accordance with previous reports ( ; ) , we found that BRAF mutation predicted resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment in the subpopulation of patients that have received this kind of therapy .	74	7	resistance or non-response
In accordance with previous reports ( ; ) , we found that BRAF mutation predicted resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment in the subpopulation of patients that have received this kind of therapy . Furthermore , the prognostic impact of BRAF mutation remains significant not only in the whole of the study but also in the subpopulation of patients that have not received an anti-EGFR moAbs . In summary , BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations , which are correlated with MSI-H status and cyclin D1 overexpression , characterise a subgroup of patients with poor prognosis .	17	69	resistance or non-response
Furthermore , De Roock and colleagues recently reported that chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancers harboring a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> KRAS mutation were more sensitive to treatment with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> compared to tumors with other KRAS mutations [ ] .	31	15	resistance or non-response
This was confirmed in vitro , and G12V mutated cancer cells were resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , whereas <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated and KRAS wild-type cancer cells were sensitive .	14	17	resistance or non-response
Although <ANNO_TYPE_drug> combination showed promising results , current data do not justify its use outside clinical trials . Targeting a specific alteration of the EGFR downstreamingsignalling Recently , investigators have identified covalent pyrimidine EGFR inhibitors , which are 30–100 fold more potent than quinazoline based EGFR inhibitors against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells , and up to 100 fold less potent against wild type EGFR cells , as CO-1686 and AP26113 [ ] .	1	48 49	response 
Another approach for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance is the dual inhibition of EGFR with afatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , an EGFR blocking antibody resembling the synergistic combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab in ErbB2 positive breast cancer .	15	3	response 
First , numbers are low in particular in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> group and secondly addition of cetuximab was not randomized for . There seems to be a selection of patients with good performance status and good prognosis who received third line therapy compared to those who did not . Therefore , we can not draw definite conclusions from our analysis whether anti-EGFR antibodies are effective in patients with KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations or not .	9	68	resistance or non-response

Successful examples of this include the co-development ( and co-approval ) of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and its companion diagnostic BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation assay for BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma , and the ALK inhibitor crizotinib and its companion diagnostic ALK fusion gene test in advanced ALK-fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients. , , However , in some cases , predictive biomarkers for a targeted therapy are not recognized until after the drug is first approved . As an example , the anti-EGFR antibody <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was first approved in the US for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in 2004 .	86	21	resistance or non-response
In the combination of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor , typically used in non-small-cell lung cancer . However , the acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of EGFR leads to erlotinib resistance .	6	29	response 
Then there is a plan for a test of the new Braf inhibitor Vemurafenib , shown to be effective in melanoma patients whose tumours display a mutation in BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , but in colorectal patients instead of melanoma . It seems that bowel tumours treated with an inhibitor of this mutated gene switch on EGFR which is the target for a number of agents including <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , so a combination of the two agents is logical to trial .	65	29	resistance or non-response
Second-generation EGFR TKIs – such as neratinib , afatinib and dacomitinib – are effective in preclinical gefitinib- and erlotinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> models , but to date their delivery in EGFR TKI-resistant patients have shown disappointing results in the clinic . Combination of afatinib with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in EGFR TKI-resistant patients resulted in a 30 % response rate and 75 % disease control rate , with significant gastrointestinal toxicity .	44	19 20	response 
However , the development of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has emerged , most often due to point mutations in the ATP binding sites ( e.g. <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D842V in PDGFRα , T315I in BCR-ABL , D816V in KIT ) [ - ] .	8	25	resistance
These approaches may be potentially applied to targeting <ANNO_TYPE_drug> FIP1L1-PDGFRα . Several compounds have been reported to overcome the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , such as nilotinib [ ] , EXEL-0862 [ ] , PKC412 ( midostaurin ) [ ] , sorafenib [ ] , ponatinib [ ] , and DCC-2036 [ ] in vitro .	8	19	resistance
Despite so , nilotinib , midostaurin and sorafenib showed limited clinical activity in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive HES/CEL patients . Clinic efficacy of other inhibitors remains to be evaluated . Therefore , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive CEL patients is still a challenge .	31	13	resistance
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance is a challenge in clinic . Clinical trials of new small molecule TKIs ( e.g. nilotinib , sorafenib and midostaurin ) were not ideal against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> PDGFRα despite these drugs in vitro activity .	0	27	resistance
For instance , one HES/CEL patient in blast crisis harboring <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα showed a short response , followed by a rapid emergence of pan-resistance D842V mutation in FIP1L1-PDGFRα . In addition , mutations such as S601P [ ] , L629P [ ] were reported to be associated with primary resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive patient .	51	10	resistance
In addition , mutations such as S601P [ ] , L629P [ ] were reported to be associated with primary resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive patient . In the present study , we reported that S116836 synthesized in our lab is a novel multiple TKI , and showing strikingly inhibitory effect on the activity of gate-keeper mutant T315I BCR-ABL and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> PDGFRα at low nanomolar concentrations .	22	61	resistance
A single 25-mg/kg oral administration of S116836 in rats generated a maximal plasma concentration of 6205.0±731.4 ( Table ) , which may be sufficient to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cells harboring gate-keeper <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> PDGFRα , T315I BCR-ABL and D816V KIT .	25 26	30 31	resistance
Taken together , S116836 could be a potential candidate for treatment of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> FIP1L1-PDGFRα dependent HES/CEL . In summary , our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that S116836 has potent activity against cells carrying wild-type or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	12	38 39	resistance
However , the development of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has emerged , most often due to point mutations in the ATP binding sites ( e.g. T674I and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in PDGFRα , T315I in BCR-ABL , D816V in KIT ) [ - ] .	8	27	resistance or non-response
For instance , one HES/CEL patient in blast crisis harboring T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα showed a short response , followed by a rapid emergence of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in FIP1L1-PDGFRα . In addition , mutations such as S601P [ ] , L629P [ ] were reported to be associated with primary resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive patient .	51	23 24	resistance or non-response
Relapse in one patient was associated with the detection of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in PDGFRA that confers resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	19	11	resistance
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation within the kinase domain of FIP1L1-PDGFRA ( adenosine-5′-triphosphate [ ATP ] -binding region ) seems to be the most frequent mutation that appears <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment and that causes resistance through steric hindrance mechanisms .	26 27	1	resistance
Treatment of two patients resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with nilotinib was successful. , Another patient intolerant to imatinib responded to nilotinib and dasatinib. , The sensitivity of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation to second generation TKIs has been a matter of debate .	6	27	resistance

However , Stover et al reported that nilotinib could not overcome the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance conferred by the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in FIP1L1-PDGFRA in the same cellular model , even at high concentrations .	12	19	resistance
Dasatinib is a dual SRC/ABL1 inhibitor that also inhibits PDGFRs and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion but has no effect on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> FIP1L1-PDGFRA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D842V mutants .	18	20	resistance
Lierman et al described a FIP1L1-PDGFRA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> patient that responded to sorafenib . However , the clinical response was short because of the emergence of another D842V mutation . This mutation is highly resistant to sorafenib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and dasatinib .	37	6	resistance

Mutation T798M at the gatekeeper residue and an ATP binding site mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L755P ) showed reduced response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , with IC50s of up to 50 times higher relative to wild-type HER2 [ ] .	21	13	resistance or non-response
The gatekeeper mutant displayed higher affinity for ATP , providing a potential explanation for resistance to the reversible TKI <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . In contrast , irreversible TKIs CL-387785 and WZ-4002 bound irreversibly to an active conformation of HER2 and suppressed HER2 signaling and growth in stable clones of wild-type or mutant T798M , L755P , or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> HER2 [ ] .	19	55	resistance or non-response

Tumour genotyping revealed a mutation on exon 18 of the PDGFRα gene , excluding <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . In September 2008 , treatment with 400 mg/day <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was initiated .	26	14 15	resistance or non-response
These results suggest that acquired resistance to adjuvant <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was infrequent , especially since both arms included patients with mutations known to be less sensitive or resistant to imatinib ( e.g. , platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha [PDGFRA ] <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] .	8	40	resistance or non-response

It is often associated with mutations in KIT exon 9 or PDGFRA exon 18 ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) but is also found in wild-type GIST ( i.e. , GIST without known mutations in KIT or PDGFRA ) [ , ] . In contrast , secondary resistance generally occurs 6 to 24 months after patients’ initial response to the treatment and is rarely seen in patients with PDGFRA mutations [ ] .

The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> B-RAF mutation appears in 4 % –15 % of CRC.– The possible relationship between of B-RAF mutational status and response to treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in 48 patients with mCRC was investigated by Benvenuti et al .

The possible relationship between of B-RAF mutational status and response to treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in 48 patients with mCRC was investigated by Benvenuti et al . B-RAF mutations were detected in 12,5 % tumors and they were mutually exclusive with K-RAS alterations . The only B-RAF mutation found was the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution .	13	50	resistance or non-response
The only B-RAF mutation found was the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution . The most important thing was that patients who received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or cetuximab but had B-RAF alteration , presented no objective response to therapy ; consequently TTP was worse for subjects bearing a mutated B-RAF although not statistically significant probably due to the limited number of tumors carrying these mutations .	19	7	resistance or non-response
Di Nicolantonio et al also demonstrated that introduction of the B-RAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> allele could confer resistance to either cetuximab or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in wild-type B-RAF colorectal cancer cells .	20	11	resistance or non-response
This is in keeping with an earlier study by Di Nicolantonio and colleagues [ ] , where the response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or cetuximab was found to be impeded by the presence of BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and restored ( in a cellular model of CRC cells ) by BRAF inhibitor sorafenib [ ] .	20	33	resistance or non-response

One mechanism to resistance was recently elucidated : cetuximab resistant cells contain an EGFR mutation in the extracellular domain ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) that impairs cetuximab , but not epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding . Therefore , since the response to therapy require the EGFR target to be present , the development of BOI methods for quantitative detection of EGFR protein levels in CRC primary and secondary tumor tissues is necessary , in order to guide the treatment of individual selected for EGFR targeted antibody treatment and in particular those who relapse while on EGFR targeting therapies . The advent of EGFR targeted antibodies , cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has paved the way to individualized medicine of mCRC .	106	20	response
Other examples of useful biomarkers are KRAS mutation testing to predict benefit from monoclonal antibodies against EGFR , cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , in metastatic colon cancer [ ] and BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation analysis in metastatic melanoma in order to predict responsiveness to BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib [ ] .	20	30	resistance or non-response

Preclinical cell studies indicate that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> may inhibit the KIT <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation that is resistant to imatinib [ ] .	5	10	response
A study by Schittenhelm et al. also indicates a possible activity against KIT activation loop mutations D816Y , D116F and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> making it useful for imatinib-resistant GISTs [ , ] . A multicenter phase II trial sponsored by the Swiss Group for clinical research is testing <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as a first-line treatment in gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( http : //www.clinicaltrials.gov/ ) .	46	20	response
Eight months after starting the treatment , when patients still responded to the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , authors sequenced kinase domain of DDR2 gene and identified the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	13	25	response
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> may therefore stabilize an active conformation that is both more oncogenic and less favored for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding .	16	0	 resistance 
Consistent with this , we found that the introduction of R1275Q into EML4-ALK had no negative impact on sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( IC50 47 ± 8 nm ) . As expected , the IC50 values for viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutants were all above that for Ba/F3 cells expressing native EML4-ALK , with IC50s ranging from 231 to 981 nm . The three most resistant mutants , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , S1206R , and G1269S , all had IC50s within twofold of parental , ALK negative , Ba/F3 cells ( IC50 1176 nm ) .	20	69	 resistance 
However , the ability of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to inhibit ALK phosphorylation was substantially reduced in all mutants tested , with IC50s & gt ; 1000 nm for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G1269S ( ) .	5	26	 resistance 
The 16 mutations are located around the kinase active site and can be categorized into five groups , involved in either direct or indirect contacts with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The three mutations that conferred the strongest resistance were the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper residue , S1206R at the solvent front , and G1269S near the DFG motif .	26	38	 resistance 
However , analogous Ba/F3 xenografts expressing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , S1206R , or G1269S mutants were completely insensitive to these doses , with no statistically significant changes in tumor growth rate . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is not efficacious in mouse Ba/F3 xenograft models expressing EML4-ALK mutants .	30	6	 resistance 
( B) PK/PD analysis after treating tumor bearing mice with a single dose of vehicle ( V , for 6 h ) or 200 mg/kg <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . In pharmacodynamic studies ( ) , xenografts expressing native EML4-ALK exhibited a 60–70 % inhibition in p-ALK levels at 6 h postdose , with more pronounced inhibition at 24 h . By contrast , p-ALK levels were reduced by approximately 25–35 % at 6 h in tumors <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or S1206R , with a partial recovery at 24 h .	25	74 75	 resistance 
By contrast , p-ALK levels were reduced by approximately 25–35 % at 6 h in tumors <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or S1206R , with a partial recovery at 24 h . There was no significant inhibition in tumors expressing the G1269S mutation . Drug exposure was similar in all models , confirming that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inactivity in the mutant ALK efficacy studies is because of the inadequate target inhibition .	51	16 17	 resistance 
In this study , we have used an accelerated mutagenesis strategy to identify an extensive set of mutations in ALK that can confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .

Secondary resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in an IMT with ALK translocation ( ALK/RANBP2 ) has been recently documented in another patient . This resistance was suspected to occur via the neuroblastoma associated <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ALK mutation that has been well studied in neuroblastomas as a mechanism of resistance to some ALK inhibitors [ ] .	3	31	 resistance 
They had found a de novo secondary mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in CD74-ROS1 , and this mutation conferred serious resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	19	8	resistance

Awad has supposed that the solvent front mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> may hinder the drug binding to the mutated ROS1 , which seems possible when a small amino acid was replaced by a larger one . Alternatively , it seems that the up-moved P-loop region in G2032R-ROS1 could attribute to the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance by attenuating the interactions between the drug and the enlarged binding pocket , which has also been observed in the C1156Y induced crizotinib resistance in the ALK tyrosine kinase .	49	8	resistance

Therefore , the P-loop was hard to be induced during the whole binding/unbinding process of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and thus , an attenuated binding state was dominated between crizotinib and binding pocket of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated ROS1 tyrosine kinase .	15	32	resistance

Whether the survival difference between BRAF WT and mutant patients is only due to the fact that BRAF mutational status has prognostic value or if BRAF mutational status may also be predictive for a combination treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and temozolomide can not be concluded definitively from our data set , but should be prospectively studied . If the 2 most frequent BRAF mutations , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and V600K , are the alterations with predictive value in melanoma patients , techniques identical or similar to method 1 described in this paper may be the detection system of choice .	37	64	sensitivity
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation results in substitution of serine with arginine at position 768 in DDR2 . Proposed DDR2 signaling in lung cancer . In vivo sensitivity of DDR2 to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was demonstrated by inhibition of tumors induced into athymic nude mice .	29	1	response
Eighty-five percent of all EGFR activating mutations are exon 19 in-frame deletions or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and they tend to be sensitive to currently approved EGFR inhibitors ( reviewed in [ ] ) . Class III mutations ( exon 20 ) are generally insensitive to EGFR inhibitors with exception of A763_Y764insFQEA [ ] . Patients with AC and “large cell” histology NSCLC should be tested at diagnosis for EGFR mutations , as those who exhibit such mutations benefit from EGFR inhibitors ( e.g. , erlotinib , gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) in the first-line setting .	87 88	13	sensitivity
HER2 amplification and EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) were mutually exclusive in this setting . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( second-generation EGFR inhibitor ) and cetuximab ( anti-EGFR antibody ) significantly inhibit HER2 phosphorylation in vitro , suggesting that tumors acquiring resistance to erlotinib should be tested for HER2 status and potentially treated with a pan-EGFR TKI inhibitor such as afatinib [ ] .	14	5	response

Furthermore , Chen et al. showed that the knockdown of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> transcript by siRNAs , recovered the sensitivity of T790M mutant cells to TKIs , decreasing cell growth and inducing apoptosis of T790M mutant NSCLC cell line H1975 treated with TKIs , or cetuximab [ ] . The same authors also described that the addition of EGFR siRNA to either TKIs or cetuximab additively enhanced growth inhibition , as well as the induction of apoptosis in all cell lines tested ( HCC827 , H292 , H358 , H1650 , H1975 ) , independent of their EGFR mutation status . Also in this case the greatest biological impact was observed when <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was combined with EGFR-specific siRNA [ ] .	110	10	response

In fact , it is restricted to 17 % ( vs 0 % in KRAS mutated ) for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> monotherapy , to 12.8 % ( vs 1.2 % in KRAS mutated ) for cetuximab monotherapy and to 59–61 % ( vs 36–33 % in KRAS mutated ) for cetuximab plus either irinotecan- or oxaliplatin based chemotherapy , respectively , . These findings clearly suggest that other factors , such as alterations in other EGFR effectors , including members of the RAS-MAPK or PI3K pathways could drive resistance to anti-EGFR therapy . BRAF is the principal downstream effector of KRAS , and its oncogenic <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations in CRCs .	18	103	resistance or non-response

Importantly , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is on the surface of the ERα LBD and does not affect the interaction of the receptor with its ligands , as shown previously by the crystallization of genistein with both wild type and Y537S mutant . Further , the mutation can be fully antagonized by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in cells , demonstrating that a single hydrogen bond can only stabilize conformers that are reasonably well populated in solution .	51	3	sensitivity
There is no apparent clinical evidence that Y537 phosphorylation influences <ANNO_TYPE_drug> response in patients . Of note , a naturally , but rarely occurring , Y537 mutation to asparagine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in breast cancer metastasis constitutively activates the estrogen receptor by a conformational change of helix 12 , which may contribute to breast cancer progression and resistance to endocrine treatment [ ] .	10	30	sensitivity

The activating nature of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L755P mutations is evident from their ability to transform Ba/F3 cells to cytokine independence relatively quickly compared to the wild type ERBB2 kinase in a competition assay ( ) . Moreover , mutations ERBB2-L755S , ERBB2-L755P and ERBB2-T798M showed enhanced MAPK signaling compared to both the wild type and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ERBB2 mutants ( ) .	55	4	resistance or non-response
It is also possible that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> introduces stabilizing polar interactions of a structurally altered active form . In conclusion , mutations affecting L755 seems to stabilize the active conformation of the ERBB2 kinase . This would explain the resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> that targets the inactive conformation of the ERBB2 kinase and the partly retained sensitivity to AEE778 that target preferentially the active conformation .	40	5	resistance or non-response

· The presence of any BCR-ABL1 mutation ( that is when considering all mutations together ) does not appear to predict differential response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) treatments ( defined <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib- , and nilotinib based regimens ) . · There is consistent evidence that presence of the relatively <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation can predict TKI treatment failure , mainly in terms of hematologic and cytogenetic response .	33 34	54 55	None
It is also reported that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and nilotinib might be taken up in cells by different mechanisms , with the influx , intracellular concentrations of imatinib , and consequently patient sensitivity to imatinib depending upon the organic cation transporter ( OCT-1 ) , whereas nilotinib transport appears to be independent of OCT-1 . Both nilotinib and dasatinib efficiently block Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase catalytic activity by binding to distinct , partially overlapping sites in the kinase domain . Cross resistance with dasatinib is limited to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , which is also the only mutant isolated at drug concentrations equivalent to maximal achievable plasma trough levels .	5	84	None
However , the T315I mutant remained resistant to nilotinib at concentrations & lt ; 10 μM. , Nilotinib also potently inhibited tyrosine autophosphorylation of the E255K , E255V , F317L , M351T , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> Bcr-Abl mutants , and these effects were not associated with decreases in Abl or Bcr-Abl protein levels .

To determine whether the stimulatory effect of imatinib on the nuclear import of the 9Y/F-KD-mutant was indeed caused by binding of the drug to the mutant protein , we introduced another amino acid substitution , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , which confers <ANNO_TYPE_drug> through interference with drug binding .	39	35	None
Furthermore , responses were achieved across all BCR-ABL mutations , except <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . These studies led to the approval of dasatinib for these patients [ - ] .

The emergence of point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain is a major cause of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in CML patients , especially in AP and BC , . These acquired mutations may alter kinase domain structure and impair drug binding affinity . The second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib show much more potent activity against BCR-ABL and most mutants , but some kinase domain mutations , especially <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , are still resistant to these drugs – .	15	69	None
Therefore , it is unlikely that the cellular resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in K562-imatinib cells is due to point mutations . However , the possibility of involvement of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation can not be ruled out .	10	27	None

Incubation of AML blasts with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced only a small decrease in survival of the cells [ ] .	63	14	None
In this case , because HBeAg was detected and HBV DNA was still high 3 months after administration of clevudin , it should be clarified that the mutations in the overlapping frame gene regions , S codon L213I ( P codons <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and A222T ) , may be associated with escape mutation as well as drug resistance .

A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	71	68	None
However , when present , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> positive cells are more likely to establish more clinically apparent , large sized clones at detection time than other types ; this may result in an increased perceived frequency of this mutation .

It could be therefore be assumed that because PIK3CA mutations drive HER related receptor addiction in these cells it would make them more susceptible to RTK inhibition ( as seen here with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib ) ( Figure ) .	62	4	None
Based on these results in first line treatment of GIST and based on promising activity in imatinib-resistant GIST patients in the phase I study [ ] , it was decided to start two randomised studies in metastatic GIST—a first line phase III study ( NCT00812240 ) comparing masitinib to imatinib and a second line phase II study ( NCT01506336 ) comparing mastinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .

Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and Wnt pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following imatinib .	53	123	None

One of the most critical mechanisms for acquired resistance is the gatekeeper EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutation , which is found in approximately 49 % –63 % of patients who have developed resistance to EGFR inhibitors. , Preliminary studies also indicate that the T790M mutation may play a crucial role in primary resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors because of clonal evolution in tumor cells with preexisting T790M mutations . Different strategies have been pursued in the management of progressive disease after treatment with first-generation EGFR TKIs , including monotherapies such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and neratinib , as well as the rational combinations of cetuximab plus erlotinib and of erlotinib/gefitinib plus everolimus .	90	13	None

Cell fraction measurement by PI-staining based FACS analysis is informative about the apoptosis inducing potential ( subG1 fraction ) and inhibition of proteasome activity ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> arrest ) . In contrast , a low IC50 ( e.g. SW1573 cells ) , as determined by MTT assay , does not necessarily correspond to enhanced apoptosis induction in a certain cell line , compared to a cell line with a higher IC50 ( e.g. , H460 cells ) .

Cyclin D1 is also a target of let-7i , and a chimera that combines Mucin 1 (MUC1) aptamer and let-7i miRNA was proved to reverse paclitaxel resistance in EOC cells through down-regulation of cyclin D1 , cyclin D2 , Dicer 1 , and PGRMC1 expressions [ ] . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family members play an important role in the control of gene expression in several phases of the cell cycle and in multiple checkpoints .	31	87	None
This group also modelled the three hLCB2a mutations onto the bacterial Sp SPT ( V246M , G268V , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) paving the way for the biochemical analysis that we describe here ( ) . In this report , we have studied the influence of the human small subunits on the activity of the HSAN1 hLCB2a mutations . As well as this , we have also characterised the bacterial mutant mimics using enzyme kinetics , spectroscopy , and molecular modelling to provide insight into the impact they have on PLP <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding , catalytic activity , and/or substrate binding .	90	19	None
Given that several aspects of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( P4 ) signaling are differentially influenced by PR isoforms , PRA/PRB ratio should be considered as an important determinant of functional consequences of P4 signaling . We have recently reported a major role of p38 and p42/44 mitogen activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) in regulating PRA/PRB expression ratio at post-translational level that might influence P4 signaling in PR expressing cells . Most of previous studies – on transcriptional regulation by PR isoforms were conducted <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells ( ER+ ) expressing either PRA or PRB where PR homodimers are the only molecular species or in separate cell lines expressing each PR isoform .	5	82 83	None
In the randomized open-label phase III CALGB 40502/NCCTG <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , the new and expensive BC treatments , nanoparticle albumin bound nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane ) and ixabepilone , the latter being a potent epothilone that can be effective after microtubule inhibitor resistance ( Ixempra ) , have failed to demonstrate any superior efficacy versus the standard of weekly paclitaxel in combination with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients with chemotherapy naïve metastatic BC .	61	8	None
Thus , the coexistences of risk alleles in MTNR1B , G6PC2 , and GCK may confer high <ANNO_TYPE_drug> level , low intra-islet glucose oxidation , and low GCK activity in carriers , causing decreased insulin secretion and increased FPG level as observed in this study . The low number of overlapping loci between FPG and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> GWAS studies suggested that genetic variants may disturb beta-cell function and affect physiological fasting glucose levels beneath the pathological thresholds of T2D .	17	55	None

These results indicate that the phosphomimetic Chk2 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant protein can compensate for the loss of DNA-PKcs and prevent dysregulation of microtubule dynamics in mitosis . Microtubule formation in Brca1-deficient cancer cells is abnormal when cells are treated with an anti-microtubule agent such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , The connection of DNA-PKcs and Chk2–Brca1 signaling in regulation of microtubule dynamics prompted us to speculate that DNA-PKcs modulates cellular sensitivity toward paclitaxel .	44	7	None
To confirm these results , MLE12 were also pretreated with either PD98059 ( 50 µM ) or U0126 ( 50 µM ) for 1 h , after which the cells were exposed to either 10 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or PBS for an additional 48 h .

Interestingly , the IC50 values of SN38 , mitoxantrone , doxorubicin , daunorubicin , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for Flp-ln-293 cells expressing other variants were significantly lower than those for cells expressing wild-type BCRP . Notably , F208S and S441N were not expressed in the cells , suggesting that the rest of the variants ( S248P , F431L , and F489L ) may also impart impaired function of BCRP . Another study showed that the P269S ( C.805OT , Ex7 ; rs34678167 ) and Q126Stop ( C.376OT , Ex4 ; rs72552713 ) alleles were found among Korean subjects , and that the transport activity of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant decreased based on methotrexate uptake by vesicles expressing this variant .	15	104	None

However , results obtained in the sub-group of wt KRas patients , corresponding to the current <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treated population , clearly suggest that CCND1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism may be used as an additional marker for predicting cetuximab efficacy , TTP and overall survival .	16	24	None
Even though some studies have reported significant associations between these polymorphisms and clinical efficacy of rituximab [ ] , trastuzumab [ ] or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] , data conflict regarding which alleles are linked to favorable patient outcome . In the present study , we report a significant influence of FCGR3A <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism on survival both in the whole population and in patients with a wt KRas tumor , with VV patients presenting a dramatically shorter survival .	23	52	None
However , results obtained in the sub-group of wt KRas patients , corresponding to the current <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treated population , clearly suggest that CCND1 A870G polymorphism may be used as an additional marker for predicting cetuximab efficacy , TTP and overall survival . Of note , FCGR3A <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism and CCND1 A870G polymorphism were significant independent predictors of overall survival in patients with wt KRas tumors .	16	47	None

Two secondary mutations of ALK associated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance – L1196M and C1156Y – were first detected in the same patient , who relapsed after achieving a partial response to the drug . The L1196M substitution occurs at the gatekeeper position of ALK ( a position that controls the binding of nucleotides and TKIs ) , and corresponds to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution in EGFR and the T315I substitution in the Bcr–Abl fusion protein , both of which confer resistance to corresponding TKIs .	7	60	None
In analysis of signaling downstream from HER2 , we observed that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment routinely down-regulates ERK activity in both SKBR3 and HER2/MCF10A models , leading to the suppression of Cyclin D1 levels and the attenuation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> target genes such as MCM7 ( Figure ) .	11	36	None

Recently , genome-wide screening for the genetic determinants of gout found that an SNP of ABCG2/BCRP ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is associated with high uric acid levels , and demonstrated that uric acid is a natural substrate of ABCG2/BCRP. , ABCG2/BCRP also appears to play a protective role against xenobiotics and their metabolites. , The typical ABCG2/BCRP substrates , irinotecan and SN-38 , are detoxified by glucuronidation with uridine-diphosphate–glucuronyltransferase , and ABCG2/BCRP can extrude SN-38–glucuronide . Interestingly , ABCG2/BCRP can transport another of the glucuronide conjugates , 17-β-estradiol 17- ( β-D-glucuronide ) , and the sulfated conjugates estrone-3-sulfate <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are also substrates of ABCG2/BCRP. , The apical localization of ABCG2/BCRP in the intestinal epithelium and the bile canalicular membrane also suggests the intestinal absorption and hepatobiliary excretion of ABCG2/BCRP substrates. , – ABCG2/BCRP may also play a protective role by transporting dietary carcinogens .	97 98	17	None

Although gefitinib was discontinued because the disease had progressed , the patient with a good performance status received 2 courses of pemetrexed and 4 sequential courses of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> chemotherapy ( ) .	91	28	None
A total of 54 Gy radiation dose plus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> 1/week 300 mg/m2 body surface was administered . 2.2. Immunohistochemistry and k-ras Mutational Analysis Immunhistochemically , the tumor cells showed strong and homogenous positivity for CKAE1/3 ( clone : AE1/3 , DAKO , 1 : 200 ) , CK5/6 ( D5 & amp ; 16B4 , CellMarque , 1 : 50 ) , and p63 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , Zeta Corp. , 1 : 100 ) .	8	65	None
With respect to lung cancer , while there are individuals who do respond to TKIs , a large proportion will develop resistance to these therapies by acquiring an additional EGFR mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , amplification of the c-MET oncogene , or hypermethylation of the PTEN locus [ – ] . High levels of ERCC1 mRNA and protein , a key player in nucleotide excision repair , have been associated with resistance to platinum based chemotherapy [ ] . Similarly , low levels of RRM1/2 mRNA and protein were associated with favorable <ANNO_TYPE_drug> response in NSCLC patients [ ] .	92	32	None
Another prominent SNV is in the gene RAD50 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , which codes for a protein that is involved in DNA double-strand break repair . Defective function of RAD50 has been linked to sensitization to cisplatin and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors . The patient was initially treated with cisplatin and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and then progressed .	52	9	None
We observed that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at low concentrations stimulated proliferation of PCa cells that express promiscuously mutant ARs ( AR-T877A , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and H874Y ) .	3	20	None
Arrows point to different conformational changes and loop movements in WT-AR and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant AR in response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> docking .	18	12	None
Cells were treated the cells with a wide range of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> doses , including physiologically attainable concentrations , to determine the role of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> AR mutation and genistein concentration on genistein effects on cell proliferation , apoptosis , and AR and PSA expression .	10	24	None
We observed that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at low concentrations stimulated proliferation of PCa cells that express promiscuously mutant ARs ( AR-T877A , W741C and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	3	22	None
Given that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation proved able to modify the response of AR to many steroids and steroid like structures such as estrogen , progesterone , bisphenol A , and even the anti-androgens such as flutamide , it could be postulated that the presence of this mutation in the AR may change the mode and eventually the function of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding to the mutant AR compared to the wild AR .	59	3	None
However , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and daidzein have been supplemented to mice fed high-fat diets and thus getting considerably obese which could explain contradictory results in the present study . Surprisingly , formononetin and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> induced hepatic steatosis .	2	32	None
Yet formononetin has a lower antioxidative capacity than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and daidzein [ ] . This could partly explain why formononetin and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> did not prevent hepatic steatosis .	8	21	None
Importantly , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is on the surface of the ERα LBD and does not affect the interaction of the receptor with its ligands , as shown previously by the crystallization <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with both wild type and Y537S mutant .	32 33	3	None
They should also help to clarify whether response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is dependent on the stage of the disease . The mutation found in our patients ( p.T139M ) was described previously as a cause of MPS IIIA in a patient from the UK but no clinical description was reported [ ] . Here we show that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in SGSH can cause a severe phenotype and does occur in the Arab population of Israel .	9	57	None
Using similar mechanisms to that of Curcumin , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs and induces breast , pancreatic and prostate cancer cell death by promoting the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins , inactivating NF-кB , and inducing cell cycle arrest - . Indol-3-Carbinol ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , extracted from cruciferous plants , plays an important role in inhibiting carcinogenesis by protecting cells from oxidative stress due to formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , known to promote cancer development .	8	45	None
The IC50 value of 4.7 nM obtained for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is in excellent accordance with data from a luciferase gene reporter assay . Thus , the ERα regulated expression of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is a suitable readout for the characterization of estrogens and antiestrogens .	8	29 30	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibited the estradiol ( 1 nM ) induced <ANNO_TYPE_variant> expression in a concentration dependent manner with an IC50 value of approximately 5 nM ( ) .	0	9	None
In previous studies full ER antagonists such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were shown to be capable of blocking such signaling pathways . The high expression and functionality of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> supports speculations on a role of NPY in tumor growth , as suggested , for instance , for SK-N-MC , and MCF-7 cells .	8	27	None
Overexpression of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is more potent than wild type LYN at inducing signalling cascade , rendering the treatment of ER downregulator <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or PI3K inhibitor BKM120 less effective .	21	2	None
AREG protein expression were also observed after hormone treatment in the C57BL/6 strain of mice ( Additional File , Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . The E2-induced increase in AREG expression was blocked by the ERα <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and P-induced AREG expression was blocked by the PR antagonist RU486 ( Figure ) .	34 35 36	20	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> is an ER antagonist that functions by down regulating the ER . Knock down of PTEN also increased ERalpha transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells , but decreased ER protein levels and transcriptional activity in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and MDA-361 cells .	0	35	None
RhoA activation was prevented by ER antagonism with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and by interference with G proteins using PTX ( ) . The ERα-selective agonist PPT was associated with a strong activation of RhoA ( ) , while the ERβ-preferential ligand , DPN , was also found to increase RhoA GTP binding , although to a lesser extent ( ) . To further test the requirement of Gα13 and RhoA for ERα induced moesin activation in T47-D breast cancer cells , we performed transient transfections with Gα13 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) or RhoA ( RhoA G14V ) constitutively active mutated constructs or with Gα13 ( Gα13 Q226L/D294N ) or RhoA ( RhoA T19N ) dominant negative constructs ( ) .	8 9	87 88	None

The patient was treated with maximal androgen blockade , including luteinizing hormone releasing-hormone analogue ( 3.65 mg/28 days ) and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 50 mg qd ) . At three years post-diagnosis , the patient underwent a transurethral resection of the prostate ( TURP ) to relieve the obstructive symptoms . A pathological examination of the resected specimens revealed UC , and the immunohistochemistry of PSA , 34βE12 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , CK7 , CK20 and p63 also yielded the same results .	20	67 68	None
However , different X-ray structures have been solved for the mutated agonist converting forms of the AR-LBD ( such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and W741L ) in complex with these drugs [ – ] . The pairwise comparison of available crystal structures has revealed that the overall configuration of the AR-LBD in complex with testosterone ( PDB: 2AM9 ) [ ] , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( PDB: 1Z95 ) [ ] or hydroxyflutamide ( PDB : 2AX6 ) [ ] is highly conserved .	60	20	None
Paradoxically , while AR is mutated and amplified in E006AA cells , the in vitro growth of these cells , as determined by a cell growth and viability MTT assay normalized for cell counts , is not affected by the addition of an increasing dose of synthetic androgen ( e.g. , 1.0 to 100 nM R1881 ) , or anti-androgen ( e.g. , 10 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) ( ) . One possibility is that this lack of ligand dependent androgenic response could be explained by reduced stability of AR dimerization at the DNA interface due to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	64 65	97	None
2Biopsy proven.3Defined as less than one attack per month while on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment.4Adjusted according to patient’s response . The genetic characteristics of the 2 groups are shown in Table .

Activation of ERK , AKT and p70 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is required for cell proliferation . The inhibition of such kinases could induce cell arrest in fibroblasts – . Our data showed that both SIRT1 transfection and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment promoted phosphorylations of ERK ( Thr202/Tyr204 ) and S6K1 ( Thr389 , Thr421/Ser424 ) , whereas that of AKT ( Ser473 ) was unchanged .	35	7	None
The obtained cinnamic acid is activated by ligation to coenzyme A by 4-coumaroyl : CoA ligase ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is then synthesized by the stilbene synthase (STS) which acts to condense three successive units of malonyl-CoA with p-coumaroyl-CoA .	20	17	None
DNA damage induced Chk2 phosphorylation is observed upon exposure to numerous chemotherapeutics including the polyphenol <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , . To investigate the potential of Gltn to likewise induce DNA damage , we probed Gltn treated cells for nuclear enrichment of γH2A.X . Phosphorylation on serine 139 of the histone variant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .X ( known as γH2A.X ) accumulates in the nucleus after DNA damage and is required for repair of damaged chromatin .	15	49	None

Another polymorphism of the OPRM1 gene ( IVS3 + <ANNO_TYPE_variant> SNP in intron 3 ) , present in 22 % of individuals in this cohort , did alter the clinical effect of fentanyl , with a modest reduction of total postoperative IV PCA use of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in carriers of the minor G allele of this SNP .	45	9	None
In vitro studies have suggested that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism affects receptor binding characteristics , or messenger RNA expression levels ; however , under some experimental conditions , there was no effect on function or expression levels . In a recent humanized mouse model exploring signal transduction pathways that mediate opioid pharmacology , sensory neurons expressing the 118GG gene displayed reduced morphine ( but not <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) potency and efficacy compared with the 118AA version .	63	6	None
Recent studies evaluating postoperative IV consumption of fentanyl according to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism of OPRM1 after surgery in various Asian cohorts revealed lower fentanyl requirements in A118G-homozygous individuals ( ) .– Potential explanations for these varying findings are that labor pain is different from that tested by experimental models of pain or that experienced in other clinical settings ( postoperative or chronic pain ) , or that the response to systemic administration <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , rather than spinal , is affected differently by OPRM1 genotype .	71 72	10	None

In addition , ROS signaling is also involved in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced mobilization and its inhibition led to reduced stem cell mobilization [ ] . We found that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is an activator of ROS signaling and increased BM S1P levels during stress induced stem cell mobilization are required for ROS activation in primitive SKL cells , thus leading to increased cell motility , as previously published [ ] .	9	27	None
Subtype B′ isolates were also more sensitive than CRF01_AE isolates to TAK779 ( P = 0.013 ) and maraviroc ( P = 0.036 ) , which may be associated with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , K305T and Q328K in V3 loop in gp120 of all CRF01_AE isolates . However , we could not exclude the possible maraviroc-resistant substitutions outside the V3 loop since the regions of the HIV-1 Env responsible for resistance to CCR5 inhibitors have mapped to not only V3 loop , but also other regions of the gp120 , or even the regions in gp41 . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> exhibited no significant inhibitory activity against all the isolates tested even at 5 µM , which is more than 10,000-fold to the sensitive X4 strain .	96	30 31	None
In contrast , complex V deficiency caused by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the mitochondrial ATPase-6 gene induces ROS overproduction and neurogenic ataxia retinitis pigmentosa [ ] .
