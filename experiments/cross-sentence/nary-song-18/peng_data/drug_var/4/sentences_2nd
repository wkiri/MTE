Most NSCLC patients who harbor activating EGFR mutations , including deletions in exon 19 or the point mutation L858R in exon 21 , experience an initial marked response to the EGFR-TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib .

Most NSCLC patients who harbor activating EGFR mutations , including deletions in exon 19 or the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 , experience an initial marked response to the EGFR-TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib .	31	18	sensitivity
We hypothesised that the mutation status in DNA extracted from pleural effusion fluid would allow prediction of the clinical outcome of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy in NSCLC patients , and we therefore expected the pleural effusion fluid to be a practical source of DNA for detection of EGFR mutations . The sites of EGFR mutations found in this study are identical to these reported in previous studies ( ; ) . The main mutations found were in-frame deletions in exon 19 and the missense mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 .	21	83	sensitivity

EGFR TKIs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , and afatinib ) lead to responses in most patients with advanced NSCLCs harboring sensitizing EGFR activating mutations when given as first or further lines of treatment . It is important to note that the most predominant somatic mutations that were included in these trials were EGFR exon 19 deletions ( the most common is delE746_A750 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ; therefore , all current genomic based approvals for EGFR TKIs are limited to tumors with the aforementioned classic mutations .	3	64	sensitivity

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> has been registered for the therapy of advanced NSCLC harbouring activating EGFR mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain , the most frequent being <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 and Del ( 746–750 ) in exon 19 [ ] .	0	24	sensitivity
About 43 % to 50 % of cases with acquired resistance to reversible EGFR TKIs can be accounted for by a secondary mutation , the gatekeeper mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> located in exon 20 of the EGFR kinase domain . This acquired alteration increases the ATP binding affinity of EGFR approximately 10-fold in the presence or absence of a TKI allowing ATP to competitively displace <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib from EGFR .	63	27	resistance or non-response
At least 10 other activating mutations ( less common single amino acid substitutions such as D761Y , L747S , and T854A ) have been reported within the kinase domain and the novel E884K mutation has been associated with resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib . Balak et al noted that given the proportion of patients with acquired resistance , whose tumors contain <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , malignant cells remain dependent on mutant EGFR for survival in at least half of patients .	40	61	resistance or non-response

Median OS was 27 months and the multivariate analysis found that PS 1 , male sex , the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , brain metastases , and bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma were associated with poor prognosis . Until now , there have been no published randomized trials of EGFR TKIs vs chemotherapy as first-line therapy for NSCLC patients from Western countries ; however , 2 integrative studies of phase II trials support the findings of the SLCG and promote the role of erlotinib as first-line therapy for patients with NSCLC carrying EGFR mutations .

In pre-clinical studies , neratinib inhibited the growth of NCI-H1975 bronchoalveolar cancer cells harboring both substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 ( L858R ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and cell lines harboring the HER2 mutation [ ] . A phase I study of the advanced stage of solid tumors showed that the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of neratinib was 320 mg once daily [ ] .

First , the single-arm phase II trial ( LUX-Lung 4 ) , involving Japanese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma that progressed after ≥12 weeks of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and/or erlotinib , has shown a modest effect in a third- or fourth-line setting [ ] .	81 82	23	resistance or non-response

One of the most critical mechanisms for acquired resistance is the gatekeeper EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutation , which is found in approximately 49 % –63 % of patients who have developed resistance to EGFR inhibitors. , Preliminary studies also indicate that the T790M mutation may play a crucial role in primary resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors because of clonal evolution in tumor cells with preexisting T790M mutations . Different strategies have been pursued in the management of progressive disease after treatment with first-generation EGFR TKIs , including monotherapies such as dasatinib and neratinib , as well as the rational combinations of cetuximab plus erlotinib and of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> plus everolimus .	106	13	resistance or non-response
For example , the combination trial of cetuximab and afatinib has shown promising results , with an overall response rate of 29 % and a median duration of response of 5.7 months in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Importantly , this combination conferred robust and durable clinical responses irrespective of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> status ( T790M positive , 32 % , versus T790M negative , 25 % ; P=0.341 ) , as well as an acceptable safety profile .	42	56	resistance or non-response

Amplification of MET , a receptor tyrosine kinase , was detected in up to 20 % of lung cancer specimens that developed acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib .

Second-generation irreversible EGFR inhibitors , which bind irreversibly in the ATP binding pocket of EGFR through a covalent bond at C797 , were shown to be more potent inhibitors of the second-site <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation than erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in pre-clinical models [ , ] ( ) .	37	32	resistance or non-response
However , in clinical studies , BIBW2992 did not prolong survival compared to placebo in NSCLC patients who have developed acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] .

The most common activating mutations ( ~90 % ) are in-frame deletions in exon 19 of EGFR and a missense mutation at 858 in exon 21 of EGFR resulting in an arginine to leucine substitution ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] .

Conversely , in a recent study , Lee and colleagues investigated the EGFR degradation inducing potential of curcumin in the primary and acquired EGFR-TKIs resistant cell lines ( CL1-5 and A549 , EGFR wide type ; H1975 , EGFRL858R + <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . The IC50 of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for these resistant cells at 72 h ( 15–20 μM ) was up to nearly 700-fold when compared with the EGFR-TKIs sensitive PC-9 cells ( EGFR19del ) ( IC50 = 30 nM ) .	46	40	resistance or non-response
Interestingly , the endogenous EGFR was dramatically depleted in response to curcumin in the three <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant cells as well [ ] .

Exon 19 deletion mutation and a mutation in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) are the two main types of EGFR mutation .

We show here that tumors with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations are inhibited in their proliferation by belinostat or 17-DMAG . Furthermore , the combination of both of these compounds synergistically inhibits growth of these tumors . The growth inhibitory effects of either belinostat or 17-DMAG were independent of the EGFR mutational status of the cells ( p = 0.2323 , p = 0.4455 , respectively ) ( Supplement Fig. 1B , C ) ; thus , their inhibitory activities were quite different from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	81	6	resistance or non-response
Initial clinical studies found that only a minority of individuals with NSCLC responded to either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] . Asian non smoking females were noted to be particularly sensitive to this class of drugs [ , ] .

Activating mutations such as exon 21 missense point mutation L858R and in-frame deletions in exon 19 are the most commonly studied predictive biomarkers of response to EGFR-TKIs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib ) , . Development of resistance to TKI is a thorny problem in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treatment . Despite the initial promising response to EGFR-TKIs in majority of NSCLC patients harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations , , most patients eventually relapse due to the emergence of acquired resistance such as the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or MET amplification , both accounting for about 70 % of the acquired resistance .	28	86	resistance or non-response

For tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) [ ] , mutations within the ATP pocket of the kinase domain may affect the interaction of the drug with its target : for example , the single amino acid mutation tyrosine/methionine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR mediates secondary resistance to the EGFR TKIs erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ , ] .	59	40	resistance or non-response
Through this approach , they showed that Src Family Kinases (SFKs) , as well as EGFR , are relevant targets for the Src inhibitor dasatinib and that acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations render cells resistant not only to erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , but also to dasatinib [ ] .	38	28	resistance or non-response
In addition , they showed that two dominant activating mutations in the PI3K catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PI3K-CA ) , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and H1047R , which are prevalent in breast cancer , also confer resistance to lapatinib [ ] . Conversely , Li et al. infected cells with lentiviruses expressing either wild-type kinases ( Src , Fyn Lyn , EGFR and others ) or kinase alleles with gatekeeper mutations . Through this approach , they showed that Src Family Kinases (SFKs) , as well as EGFR , are relevant targets for the Src inhibitor dasatinib and that acquired T790M mutations render cells resistant not only to erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , but also to dasatinib [ ] .	108	21	resistance or non-response
The most common mutations are an in-frame deletion in exon 19 around codons 746–750 ( 45 % –50 % of all somatic EGFR mutations ) and a missense mutation leading to leucine to arginine substitution at codon 858 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 21 ( 35 % –45 % of mutations ) [ ] . Several NSCLC cell lines lacking the above cited mutations are considered valuable models to study intrinsic resistance to the EGFR TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , such as A549 , H460 , H1299 and GLC-82 .	76	38 39	sensitivity

EGFR mutations are divided into two groups of drug resistant and drug sensitive mutations ( the drugs are erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) .

These mutations , including in-frame deletion of several amino acids , resulted in tumors that became significantly more responsive to treatment by erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than tumors that did not have EGFR mutations . These studies have advanced our understanding of the role of EGFR mutations in interacting with TKIs , but currently there is not enough research to form a reliable antibody based EGFR therapy ( Mukohara et al. , ) . Approximately half of the NSCLC tumors found in patients who initially responded to first-generation EGFR TKIs and then develop resistance have another mutation , known as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in EGFR ( Sharma et al. , ; Suda et al. , ) .	24	100	resistance or non-response

Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , have achieved high clinical response rates in patients with non-small cell lung cancers ( NSCLCs ) , which possess somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene . However , over time ( median of 6-12 months ) , most tumors are known to develop acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs .

Somatic mutation of EGFR defines a specific subclass of lung adenocarcinomas with sensitivity to treatment with the EGFR inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ - ] . The two major classes of EGFR mutations are an <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation and small , in-frame deletions in exon 19 ; both types of mutation enhance the activity and oncogenicity of EGFR compared to the wild-type protein [ ] .	19	35	sensitivity
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , have shown remarkable activity in the patients with NSCLC , and particularly these TKIs are more effective to NSCLC with EGFR mutations in 19 exon ( in-frame deletions ) and exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation ) , which are found to be more prevalent in Asian patients [ , ] .	16	53	sensitivity

Asymmetric dimerization is required for oncogenic activity of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G724S mutant Recently , we reported that a subset of lung cancer derived oncogenic EGFR mutants such as L858R require asymmetric dimerization for biochemical activation and oncogenic transforming activity , meaning that their oncogenic ability depend on formation of an EGFR homodimer in which two distinct regions of the two molecule dimerize [ ] .

Given that colon cancer derived <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G724S mutants are sensitive to cetuximab , we sought to examine whether oncogenic potential of these mutants are dependent on the asymmetric dimerization like lung cancer derived L858R mutant .	19	93	sensitivity

Patients harboring exon 20 insertion mutations should receive irreversible inhibitors rather than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in exon 20 is responsible for approximately 50 % patients with acquired resistance against TKIs [ ] .	12	16	resistance or non-response
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in exon 20 is responsible for approximately 50 % patients with acquired resistance against TKIs [ ] .

This mutation does not reduce the affinity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib to the receptors but it enhances the affinity to ATP and thereby causes resistance . However , de novo <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations were found in Chinese patients with NSCLC before administration of TKIs in our study , indicating that T790M could also lead to primary resistance against TKIs ; this might confirm that a low frequency T790M mutation may have been present in the primary cancer , but under the selective pressure imposed by targeted therapies it may expand and lead to TKIs resistance [ ] .	8	30	resistance or non-response
Indeed , in non-small cell lung cancers treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , sensitive patients have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in only a few cells , whereas resistant patients exhibit EGFR T790M in the majority of the tumour cells ( ; ) .	9	18	resistance or non-response
It has been proved that somatic mutations in exons 19 or 21 are related to tumor sensitivity to therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib . A higher median survival rate was observed in the case of exon deletion in exon 19 than in the case of the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 [ ] .	28	56	sensitivity
miR-128b loss-of-heterozygosity has been found in NSCLC patients and has been shown to be positively correlated with clinical response and survival following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment ( ) . Several other EGFR genetic alterations with oncogenic potential have been reported ; for example , deletion mutants in glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ; deletion of exons 2–7 , denoted EGFRvIII ) and in NSCLC ( exon 19 ) , and activating kinase domain mutations in NSCLC , for example , the leucine-to-argine substitution at position 858 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ; ) .	22	83 84	sensitivity
Similarly , EGFR-T790M mutant could cause resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and Erlotinib drugs in the treatment of lung cancer , . Importantly , these mutations can promote oncogenic activation , uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis even in the absence of the selective pressure from the kinase inhibitors . An activating mutation in the activation loop of the EGFR kinase domain , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( also identified as Leu834 in a different numbering of the EGFR sequence ) is among most frequent mutations in lung cancer , amounting to more than 40 % of EGFR mutations in this cancer category – .	8	60	sensitivity
Two months following the completion of chemotherapy , the patient developed dyspnea on exertion due to reaccumulation of left pleural fluid and the cytological pleural fluid specimens showed an EGFR mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in exon 21 ) .

Yamauchi M , et al also found N-cadherin expression was significantly upregulated in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> PC9/ZD cells harboring the acquired resistant mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in the EGFR gene , other cells expressing N-cadherin were found resistant to erlotinib ( A549 , H157 , and H322 ) and that inhibition of N-cadherin expression using siRNA led to a significant decrease in viability in A549 and H322 cells .	13	21	resistance or non-response

NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor activating kinase domain mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) often initially respond to treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment invariably develops. , There is no effective therapy for patients who develop such resistance . Work by our group and others has shown that resistance to EGFR TKI treatment can occur through a secondary resistance mutation in EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , activation of the MET kinase , and activation of the NF-kB pathway.– .	32	79	resistance or non-response
To further explore the role of AXL in EGFR TKI acquired resistance we next focused on the novel in vitro models of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> acquired resistance that we generated in conjunction with the in vivo tumor xenograft models . Each of these cell lines was also resistant to the irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitor BIBW2992 ( afatinib ) ( ) . Thus resistance in these cellular models is unlikely a consequence of the secondary drug resistance mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in EGFR and is generalizable to distinct classes of EGFR TKIs .	22	76	resistance or non-response
Indeed , the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation was not detected by sequencing in any ER subline ( data not shown ) . We sought to determine whether AXL or other genes previously implicated in EGFR TKI acquired resistance were upregulated in the HCC827 ER1-5 sublines compared to parental cells . To identify genes that were differentially regulated ( threshold 3-fold change , FDR & lt ; 0.1 ) in the context of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> acquired resistance , we profiled the ER1-3 sublines as compared to parental HCC827 cells by genome-wide microarrays ( ) and validated our findings by Q RT PCR and western blots in all 5 sublines .	72	4	resistance or non-response
To test this hypothesis and to clinically validate our preclinical findings , we measured the expression of AXL by IHC ( immunohistochemistry ) in 35 matched EGFR-mutant NSCLC specimens obtained from patients both prior to treatment with the EGFR TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib and upon the development of EGFR TKI acquired resistance . In cases where enough material was available for additional studies , we also examined the specimens for GAS6 and vimentin ( as a marker for EMT ) expression by IHC ( scoring system shown in ) , EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> by sequencing , and MET amplification by FISH .	40	91	resistance or non-response
Our analysis of the clinical specimens shows that AXL upregulation is the second most common mechanism of EGFR TKI acquired resistance ( after EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs that has been validated using primary human data . Importantly , we found upregulation of AXL in patients that developed resistance to both EGFR TKIs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib ) that are clinically approved for use in NSCLC patients worldwide .	55	24	resistance or non-response

In particular , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant is 10- to 100-fold more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib than the wild-type kinase , ,, and significantly more sensitive than the G719S mutant .	13	4	sensitivity
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> was administered to 217 patients , of whom 113 received the TKI as first-line therapy and 104 as second- or third-line therapy . EGFR exon 19 deletions were detected in 135 cases , and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in 82 tumors .	0	36	sensitivity

Median OS was 27 months and the multivariate analysis found that PS 1 , male sex , the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , brain metastases , and bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma were associated with poor prognosis . Until now , there have been no published randomized trials of EGFR TKIs vs chemotherapy as first-line therapy for NSCLC patients from Western countries ; however , 2 integrative studies of phase II trials support the findings of the SLCG and promote the role of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as first-line therapy for patients with NSCLC carrying EGFR mutations .	81	21	sensitivity
About 43 % to 50 % of cases with acquired resistance to reversible EGFR TKIs can be accounted for by a secondary mutation , the gatekeeper mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> located in exon 20 of the EGFR kinase domain . This acquired alteration increases the ATP binding affinity of EGFR approximately 10-fold in the presence or absence of a TKI allowing ATP to competitively displace gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> from EGFR .	65	27	resistance or non-response
At least 10 other activating mutations ( less common single amino acid substitutions such as D761Y , L747S , and T854A ) have been reported within the kinase domain and the novel E884K mutation has been associated with resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Balak et al noted that given the proportion of patients with acquired resistance , whose tumors contain <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , malignant cells remain dependent on mutant EGFR for survival in at least half of patients .	42	61	resistance or non-response

These mutations , including in-frame deletion of several amino acids , resulted in tumors that became significantly more responsive to treatment by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib than tumors that did not have EGFR mutations . These studies have advanced our understanding of the role of EGFR mutations in interacting with TKIs , but currently there is not enough research to form a reliable antibody based EGFR therapy ( Mukohara et al. , ) . Approximately half of the NSCLC tumors found in patients who initially responded to first-generation EGFR TKIs and then develop resistance have another mutation , known as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in EGFR ( Sharma et al. , ; Suda et al. , ) .	22	100	resistance or non-response

Furthermore , when treated with first-generation TKIs , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells are expressed with an increasingly larger percentage of the tumor mass over time ( Inukai et al. , ) .

At present , there are insufficient data to treat patients with tumours having classical activating exon 19 or 21 mutations that coexist with exon 20 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations differently than patients without exon 20 mutations .

This has been reported by several prospective trials of gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in EGFR mutated NSCLC , which showed RRs exceeding 70 % in tumors with exon 19 deletions or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , with PFS intervals of 6-14 months and OS times beyond 20-24 months- .	11	31	sensitivity
All EGFR mutated patients treated with gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> invariably develop acquired resistance to this kind of therapy , ( Figure ) .

Neratinib ( HKI-272 ) , one of the three agents investigated , has n't shown good RR when tested on patients with known <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , therefore further development of this drug in lung cancer has been halted .

Strikingly , we reliably saw [ 18F ] FLT PET responses when morphological changes were still absent and 4 days before actual tumor shrinkage was observed . The observed responses were specifically due to inhibition of EGFR kinase activity as mice with tumors expressing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance allele of EGFR did not exhibit any signs of apoptosis or therapeutic response .	19	80	resistance or non-response

Lazzara and colleagues found that SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation was not induced in response to EGF in the H3255 cells , which harbor the missense <ANNO_TYPE_variant> exon 21 mutation , suggesting that SHP2 activity may be less efficiently promoted by EGFR L858R and the STAT3 pathway may be more active .

The emergence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR gatekeeper mutation and up-regulation of downstream signaling by MET amplification have been described as the two main mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance .

These results reinforce the need for 2nd and 3rd generation EGFR TKIs , while taking into account existing data that suggest use of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib beyond progression , with added chemotherapy , radiotherapy or best supportive care may improve survival . Although afatinib and dacomitinib have been introduced to overcome acquired resistance , they showed limited efficacy in NSCLC with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and were more than 100-fold less potent in NSCLC cells with EGFR T790M mutation than in NSCLC cells with EGFR activating mutation .	23	61	resistance or non-response
CO-1686 is a novel covalent inhibitor that irreversibly and selectively targets both the initial activating EGFR mutations and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary acquired resistance mutation . To investigate its use as a single agent , CO-1686 is being evaluated in a phase I/II trial in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients previously treated with first-line gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( NCT01526928 ) .	53	19	resistance or non-response
To investigate its use as a single agent , CO-1686 is being evaluated in a phase I/II trial in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients previously treated with first-line gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( NCT01526928 ) . In the phase I study , and based on early findings from the ongoing phase II trial , the agent yielded a 58 % ORR across all dose levels in trial participants with biopsy confirmed EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations .	28	69	resistance or non-response
These were clustered in exons 18 , 19 and 21 and were either small in-frame deletion ( 746–750 , adjacent to K745 : ELREA aminoacids ) or heterozygous missense mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> adjacent to the DFG motif in the COOH-terminal lobe in the activation loop of the kinase ) around the ATP binding pocket . Pooled data from these three studies show that 25 of 31 ( 81 % ) patients with partial response or marked clinical improvement have an EGFR mutation , vs. none of 29 specimens from refractory patients ( p=0.0001 ) . Several other studies investigate the role of these mutations in the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR TK inhibitors , demonstrating a statistically significant correlation between the response to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and the presence of the biological data , but this correspondence is not always 100 % [ – ] ( Table ) .	126	31 32	sensitivity
Finally , a recent study shows not only that EGFR mutations are statistically associated with Asian ethnicity and never-smoker status , but also that patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions have significantly longer median survival than patients with EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( 34 vs. 8 months , p=0.01 ) after treatment with gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	54	39	sensitivity
First , a secondary mutation in exon 20 , leading to a substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the kinase domain , is reported in 2 of 5 patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	41	21	resistance or non-response
The appearance of a second mutation represents a mechanism of resistance : in fact the authors demonstrate that the insertion of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> into test cells renders them resistant to gefitinib in vitro . They also find that when test cells transfected with both mutations are treated with other EGFR inhibitors , such as AG1478 , cetuximab , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or CL-387,785 , no objective response is obtained using the first three agents , while the fourth is effective .	57	21	resistance or non-response
It also inhibits EGFR activating mutations , as well as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutations [ ] . A phase I study demonstrated good tolerance to this agent , and 4 patients in this study who had NSCLC with prior treatment with a first line TKI , demonstrated partial response to PF299804 [ ] .

Approximately 70–80 % of NSCLCs harbouring a somatic mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene respond to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , , . However , acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy almost always develops after a median of approximately 10 months from the onset of treatment , even in patients who exhibit an initial dramatic response to these agents . Acquired resistance has been associated with a secondary mutation in the EGFR gene , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , , which has been detected in approximately 50 % of cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs , .	20	74	resistance or non-response

There are some ongoing clinical trials investigating the effects of adding <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or a MET inhibitor to EGFR TKI . It should be noted that discontinuation of an EGFR TKI could result in accelerated disease progression. , In a study reported by Chaft et al , 23 % of patients experienced a disease flare after stopping <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib .	56	11	resistance or non-response
Although more than 188 EGFR mutations have been identified , 85 % of TKI-sensitive clinical cases harbor only two major mutations : in-frame deletions of exon 19 ( 45 % –50 % ) and a point <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 ( 40 % –45 % ; ) . In addition , deletion mutation in exon 19 seems to have a better response to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than mutations at other sites. ,	66	36 37	sensitivity
T854A mutation in exon 21 interferes the contact of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to the ATP pocket of the receptor , hence abrogating the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation by erlotinib .

First-generation EGFR-TKIs ( gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) inhibit EGFR signaling cascade by reversible binding to the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) binding site of the EGFR [ ] . Although initial responses to reversible EGFR-TKIs in most patients with EGFR activating mutations were observed , almost all patients acquired resistance to these agents via diverse mechanisms [ ] . A secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( leading to acquired resistance ) in exon 20 of EGFR occurred in approximately half of the patients [ ] .	5	61	resistance or non-response

Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , including gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which specifically block the EGFR dependent pathway , were the first targeted drugs to enter the clinical use for the treatment of lung cancer . It has been extensively proved that NSCLC patients harboring sensitive EGFR mutations , which mainly refer to exon 19 deletions or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution in exon 21 , usually benefit more from EGFR-TKIs than wild-type patients , .	11	59	sensitivity
Several studies have reported that advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion had a longer overall survival ( OS ) and/or progression-free survival ( PFS ) following treatment with gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> compared with those with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , , , but this result has not been shown in all reports , , , , .	32	38	sensitivity
Another seven studies ( clinical trials or retrospective studies ) , , , , , , involving 549 advanced NSCLC patients receiving first-line EGFR-TKIs ( gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) presented direct comparison of exon 19 deletion and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation for PFS .	27	37	sensitivity
We conducted this study and found that patients with exon 19 deletion had significantly reduced disease progression risk than those with exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation after front-line TKIs . Additionally , similar trends of favorable outcome of PFS in exon 19 deletion among different first-line EGFR targeted agents ( gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and afatinib ) , were presented in our work , but the statistical significances were not approached .	51	23	sensitivity
Afatinib and dacomitinib , which are the furthest in clinical development , have demonstrated superior PFS compared with either chemotherapy or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , but no differences in overall survival ( OS ) in the reported randomized Phase II/III studies to date. [ ] Further development of neratinib in NSCLC is unlikely given its low clinical activity due to dosing limitations arising from diarrhea related toxicities. [ ] Pelitinib ( EKB-569 ) and canertinib ( CI-1033 ) have also been discontinued from further clinical development . Based on the clinical data of achievable plasma concentrations of continuous daily dosing of neratinib , dacomitinib and afatinib , it is thought that primary resistance to these agents will still be encountered for the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation as well as exon 20 insertions [ ] and clinical trial results thus far with the second-generation EGFR TKIs had generally supported this prediction with few exceptions ( see below ) .	21	121	resistance or non-response
However , treatment with gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> will eventually fail because of the development of acquired drug resistance resulting from amplification of the MET proto-oncogene or the threonine-to-methionine amino acid substitution at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) of EGFR , which is detected in 50 % of clinically resistant patients , .	6	35	resistance or non-response
To screen for the agents to overcome gefitinib-resistance , we here synthesized a number of novel gefitinib structural analogues and tested their inhibitory effects on EGFR kinase activity and proliferation of NCI-H1975 cells which harbor L858R/T790M-EGFR , , and wild-type MET without genomic amplification that are resistant to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . We found a gefitinib mimetic , N- ( 2-bromo-5- ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ) -6-methoxy-7- ( 3- ( piperidin-1-yl ) propoxy ) quinazolin-4-amine ( hereafter , V1801 ) , moderately inhibited EGFR kinase activity but significantly suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR harboring non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells in vitro and in vivo .	50	95	resistance or non-response
Approximately 90 % of all activating mutations are exon 19 deletions and a point mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 21 . At present , although it is recommended that the presence of activating mutations in the EGFR gene should be identified before treatment with gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , there is no consensus regarding the specific mutations that should be tested nor methods that should be used .	47	16	sensitivity
KRAS is downstream in the EGFR tyrosine kinase pathway ; therefore , tyrosine kinase based treatment with gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is ineffective when KRAS is constitutively activated ( , ) . EGFR mutations occur most frequently in exons 18 to 21 . The most common mutations , small in-frame deletions in exon 19 ( & gt ; 50 % ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitutions in exon 21 ( 40 % ) , are reported to be the most closely associated with EGFR inhibitor therapy response ( , ) .	19	61	sensitivity
A number of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) ( e.g. , gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , lapatinib ) and antibodies ( eg , trastuzumab , cetuximab , panitumumab ) targeting the erbB family have been developed to treat breast , colorectal , lung , gastric and head and neck squamous cell cancers [ ] . Despite the improvements achieved in patients treated with reversible inhibitors of EGFR or EGFR and HER2 , primary and acquired resistances to these agents remain a clinical challenge . This is exemplified by the development of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , through emergence of a secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutation in non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) [ ] , which occurs in 50 % of the patients with lung adenocarcinoma [ ] .	15	107	resistance or non-response

As previously demonstrated [ , , ] , cells with the deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R were inhibited by the TKIs gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , while the exon 20 insertion mutation was resistant . Three patients with lung adenocarcinoma and with exon 20 deletion mutants of EGFR failed to show a clinical response ( contrary to the expectation that , since the general response rate of tumors with EGFR mutations to TKIs is about 80 % , two or all three of these particular ones would be responsive ) . However , the cells with the insertion mutation demonstrated increased sensitivity to the irreversible inhibitor CL-387,785 , previously demonstrated to be active against cells with both an activating mutation and the resistance associated point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> on exon 20 .	25	127	resistance or non-response
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) targeting EGFR , including gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , have become the standard first line therapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) that harbor activating EGFR mutations , .

MET has also been shown to signal synergistically with EGFR as part of a broad signaling network that cooperatively drives activation of these downstream pathways.

Exon 19 deletions and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation constitute ∼90 % of the EGFR mutations identified to date .

Also available is a second assay , the BRAF ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> Sequencing ) ( V6S ) , which uses sequencing to detect the BRAF p.Val600Glu sequence variant . Public Health Importance Available evidence indicates that the clinical benefit from treatment with EGFR monoclonal antibody inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab is limited to a subgroup of only 10 % to 30 % of CRC patients .	45	10	resistance or non-response
Recently , BRAF mutation ( & gt ; 95 % of BRAF point mutations occure at BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is introduced to be associated with resistance to targeted agents . BRAF protein , a serine-threonine kinase , is the principal downstream molecular of KRAS . A meta-analysis by Bokemeyer C , et al , in 2012 based on two RCTs ( the OPUS and CRYSTAL trials ) reported that in KRAS wild-type ( WT ) patients , adding <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to chemotherapy was beneficial for BRAF WT patients , but not for BRAF mutant patients .	78	17	resistance or non-response

In an abstract recently published in the 2011 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings , Tejpar et al. retrospectively analyzed the influence of KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations on the efficacy of treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as the first-line systemic therapy and compared it with the pooled results of randomized studies CRYSTAL and OPUS .	30	22	resistance or non-response
The KRAS status is the first molecular marker to predict the response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab in metastatic CRC ( mCRC ) patients , and it needs to be determined before deciding in favor of treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies . Previous retrospective studies suggested that mt-BRAF was a marker of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and that the patients with mt-BRAF had significantly shorter PFS and OS than the patients with wt-BRAF tumours . The mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes have been reported to be mutually exclusive. , In the retrospective analysis by Fariña- Sarasqueta et al. , it was also shown that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was an independent prognostic factor for the survival of patients with colon cancer in stages II and III , while the KRAS mutations did not have any effect on the overall survival of these patients .	16	108 109	resistance or non-response
The results of a small study of 74 patients , conducted by Loupakis with his colleagues , suggested that rare KRAS mutations in codon 61 and in codon 146 might also be responsible for in the treatment resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. , In contrast , in their large retrospective analysis , De Roock et al. concluded that the codon 146 mutations did not affect the response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and that the patients with codon 61 mutant tumours had lower response rate . According to the analysis of other mutations , they proposed testing of KRAS status , if not mutated , then of BRAF and NRAS status , and PIK3CA exon 20 mutation in order to improve the objective response up to 40 % in selected patients . In our retrospective study , 26.7 % of patients , all with KRAS wild-type tumours , who had previously unresectable liver-only metastases , underwent surgical resection after systemic therapy , with R0 resection achieved in 38 patients ( 21.6 % ) ; one of those was patient with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	68	179	resistance or non-response
This finding has led to the selection of patients for EGFR blockade therapy based on KRAS status , with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> only offered to those patients with no KRAS mutation in the primary tumor- . In a similar fashion , a small percentage of primary CRC contains a mutation in the BRAF gene . The BRAF ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) mutation in CRC confers poor survival with standard chemotherapy regimens , .	19	56	resistance or non-response
By adding <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for EGFR inhibition to a standard regimen of vemurafenib , a significant antitumor response was shown in vitro and in vivo . While there are no reported results of this combination therapy in adult patients , the laboratory results are promising and may offer another option for late stage CRC patients with wild-type KRAS and the BRAF ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) mutation .	2	61	resistance or non-response
Poziotinib ( also known as HM781-36B ) , a new potent irreversible inhibitor of EGFR , HER2 , HER4 , and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood family of kinases inhibitor ( BTK , BLK , and BMX ) , demonstrated preclinical efficacy against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant at eightfold lower doses compared to afatinib . A different approach in addressing EGFR-TKI resistance involves the use of combination regimens . Therefore , the combination of erlotinib with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and the combination of erlotinib with MM-121 ( a fully human mAb that targets HER3 ) , in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs did not show sufficient clinical activity for further investigation in this population .	73	42	response 
While it has been proven that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is not active in patients bearing KRAS mutant tumours [ , ] , even if a recent analysis suggests that this could not be true for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations [ ] , up today there are no predictive biomarkers of bevacizumab efficacy .	6	33	resistance or non-response
In clinical studies of metastatic colon cancer , patients with wild type K-ras , B-raf and PIK3CA genes gain benefit from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy [ ] , whilst lung cancer patients with mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene benefit from Iressa or Tarceva therapy . These findings suggest that gene mutation ( s ) may play a key role in resistance to Trastuzumab treatment . After screening for EGFR , K-ras , B-raf and PIK3CA gene mutations in the 5 PDECX mouse models and their corresponding primary tumors , we found that model EC039 ( and the corresponding patient tissue ) had a helical domain mutation ( G1624A , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene ( Figure and Table ) .	21	112	resistance or non-response

Approximately 5 % to 7 % of GIST harbour oncogenic mutations in PDGFRA , typically in the juxtamembrane domain ( exon 12 ) or activation loop ( exon 18 ) ; the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution in exon 18 , is highly resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	42	32	resistance or non-response

It was initially proposed that the T790M mutation might prevent the proper binding of tyrosine kinase inhibitors via steric hindrance , similar to the corresponding gatekeeper mutations in BCR-ABL ( T315I ) and KIT ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) that confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Gleevec ) in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors .	41	35	resistance

We have not observed any response to sunitinib in group of patients with PDGFRA mutations ( mainly <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , which has been also shown in preclinical data . We did not analyze the impact of secondary mutations , although patients from clinical trials with tumors harboring a secondary mutation in exon 13 or exon 14 KIT have a longer PFS than patients with exon 17 or 18 mutations [ , - ] . On the other hand , utility of analysis of secondary mutations is very challenging because <ANNO_TYPE_drug> GISTs are very heterogeneous with multiple clones having different secondary mutations within the same or different nodules [ - ] .	89	17	resistance or non-response
Further , although approximately 70 % of c-Kit mutations in melanoma and GIST occur in exon 11 , there is a preponderance of the activating <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , exon 11 variant in melanoma ( ~34 % of c-Kit mutations ) and this mutation shows poor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity in GIST [ ] , and variable sensitivity in melanoma [ , ] .	44	25	resistance or non-response
The fundamental roles of MAPK and PI3K signalling were also demonstrated in c-Kit mutant melanoma cell models with acquired resistance to c-Kit inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and nilotinib [ ] .

The genetic effectors of resistance included additional secondary c-Kit mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or T670I ) and c-Kit independent mechanisms [ ] . Given multiple resistance mechanisms , with varied responses to alternative c-Kit inhibitors , developed from a single parental cell line it is reasonable to predict that clinical resistance may also be heterogeneous .

Similarly , a patient developed resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> after 5 months of treatment and molecular analyses revealed the resistant tumor harbored two acquired but independent mutations within the kinase domain of EML4-ALK , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and the gatekeeper mutation L1196M .	7	33	 resistance 
Similar to the threonine at position 315 in ABL and at position 790 in EGFR , – the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation corresponds to this well described gatekeeper residue . Thus , all three of these mutations have been demonstrated to interfere with the binding of their respective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. , – The other ALK resistance mutations are located around the conformationally sensitive C-helix and activation loop , and may affect kinase activity and inhibitor binding through alterations in the structure or stability of these elements . For instance , substitution of a bulkier alanine at the glycine 1269 residue positioned at the end of the narrow ATP binding pocket of ALK is thought to reduce the binding affinity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as a result of steric hindrance .	120	18 19	 resistance

It is noteworthy that in H1975 cells carrying the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> had a slightly higher activity than the reversible kinase inhibitors , but this difference was small and the activity was still logarithmically inferior to what was observed in the HCC827 cell lines .	13	9	response

EGFR TKIs ( gefitinib , erlotinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) lead to responses in most patients with advanced NSCLCs harboring sensitizing EGFR activating mutations when given as first or further lines of treatment . It is important to note that the most predominant somatic mutations that were included in these trials were EGFR exon 19 deletions ( the most common is delE746_A750 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ; therefore , all current genomic based approvals for EGFR TKIs are limited to tumors with the aforementioned classic mutations .	8	64	sensitivity
This indicates that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant EGFR is a less potent driver of cell growth and survival compared to mutant EGFR without a T790M . This could be an additional explanation for the clinical resistance to TKI inhibition of that receptor , even when the covalent binding ErbB family inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is used .	49	3	response 
Based on the clinical data of achievable plasma concentrations of continuous daily dosing of neratinib , dacomitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , it is thought that primary resistance to these agents will still be encountered for the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation as well as exon 20 insertions [ ] and clinical trial results thus far with the second-generation EGFR TKIs had generally supported this prediction with few exceptions ( see below ) .	18	36	response

KRAS activating mutations reduce or abolish intrinsic GTPase activity of the protein , leading to its constitutive activation ( ) Similarly BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation induces structural changes in RAF protein which increase its kinase activity ( ) Activated RAS and RAF are responsible for the disregulation of RAS/RAF/MAPKs signalling pathway . KRAS codons 12 and 13 activating mutations are widely recognised as predictors of resistance to the treatment with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies ( moAbs ) in metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) patients ( ; ) . Based on retrospectively collected data and post hoc analyses of large phase III studies , the European Medicines Agency has restricted the use of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to the treatment of patients with KRAS codons 12 and 13 wild-type disease ( about the 60 % of the overall population ; ) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology has similarly recommended in a recent provisional clinic opinion not to administer anti-EGFR moAbs to patients with KRAS codons 12 or 13 mutated tumours ( ) .	111	22	resistance or non-response

To optimise the selection of patients who are more likely to benefit from anti-EGFR we investigated in a cohort of patients treated with the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and irinotecan and bearing KRAS codons 12 and 13 wild-type tumours , the association of KRAS codons 61 and 146 mutations and BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation with clinical outcomes .	26	50	resistance or non-response
Patients with irinotecan-refractory mCRC ( ie , progressed during or within 3 months after treatment with an irinotecan based regimen ) were considered eligible for our study if they had an histologically confirmed diagnosis of EGFR positive adenocarcinoma , measurable and evaluable disease according to RECIST criteria ( ) available paraffin embedded samples of primary lesions and had undergone a salvage <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment . All patients ' samples were screened for KRAS codons 12 and 13 mutations , constituting the group named ‘overall population ' and only those with wild-type disease were included in the group named ‘study population ' and further analysed for KRAS codons 61 , 146 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations .	61	110 111	resistance or non-response
Taking into account these considerations and the growing knowledge on minor oncogenic KRAS mutations in codons 61 and 146 ( mutually exclusive with those in codons 12 and 13 ) , we conducted this retrospective study to verify whether the combined analyses of such rare KRAS mutations and BRAF codon 600 variants are related to resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> plus irinotecan . In the present analysis , 13 , 7 and 1 patient among 87 patients with KRAS codon 12 and 13 wild-type disease had tumour bearing BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , KRAS codon 61 and KRAS codon 146 mutation , respectively .	57	87	resistance or non-response

These findings clearly suggest that other factors , such as alterations in other EGFR effectors , including members of the RAS-MAPK or PI3K pathways could drive resistance to anti-EGFR therapy .

<ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations represent more than 87 % of codon 13 mutations according to COSMIC Sanger database . Mutations on codons 61 and 146 have also been described in 2.1 % and 1.9 % of the cases , respectively [ ] . Only one retrospective study showed the impact of codon 61 or codon 146 on response to anti-EGFR therapies in mCRC [ ] and only codons 12 and 13 mutations are clearly reported to be predictive of response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab .	79	0	resistance or non-response

Although KIT inhibitors such as Imatinib are effective for KIT juxtamembrane mutations frequent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors , Imatinib fails to bind and inhibit KIT <ANNO_TYPE_variant> kinase [ - ] .

These inhibitors—imatinib , sunitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and dasatanib—were developed for different cancers ( chronic myeloid leukemia , gastrointestinal stromal tumors ) and different kinases , but they showed activity against KIT . Approximately 70 % of KIT mutations identified in melanoma are found in exon 11 , most commonly <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and in the kinase domain in exon 13 , most often K642E [ ] .	4 5	50	resistance or non-response
Further , although approximately 70 % of c-Kit mutations in melanoma and GIST occur in exon 11 , there is a preponderance of the activating <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , exon 11 variant in melanoma ( ~34 % of c-Kit mutations ) and this mutation shows poor imatinib sensitivity in GIST [ ] , and variable sensitivity in melanoma [ , ] . Several other c-Kit inhibitors , including sunitinib [ ] , dasatinib [ ] and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] are active in c-Kit mutated melanoma , but their inhibitory profile varies and comparisons with imatinib are difficult due to the small numbers of reported patients on alternative kinase inhibitors .	74	25	resistance or non-response

Our in vitro studies demonstrated that both of the secondary mutations initially identified in our lab ( T790M and L747S ) confer varying degrees of resistance to the apoptotic signals initiated by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	87	28	None

Transient transfection experiments utilizing COS-7 cells demonstrated that auto-phosphorylation of the original L858R EGFR was inhibited by lower concentrations of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib than the L858R-L747S or L858R-T790M constructs ( A ) . CL-387,785 partially overcame the observed inhibition ( B ) . To prove the functional significance of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , we generated Ba/F3 cell lines stably expressing mutant EGFR constructs [ ] .	20	50	None
To prove the functional significance of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , we generated Ba/F3 cell lines stably expressing mutant EGFR constructs [ ] . These cell lines , including L858R-L747S , proliferated in the absence of IL3 . Ba/F3-L858R cells were extremely sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( D ) , whereas Ba/F3-L858R-T790M cells were highly resistant up to 1 μM gefitinib .	43	7	None

After the cells were exposed to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for 24 h , Ba/F3-L858R cells were unable to proliferate while Ba/F3-L858R-L747S and Ba/F3-L858R-T790M cells continued to grow even in the presence of 1 μM gefitinib ( E ) . These results suggest that execution of apoptosis may be impaired by the presence of T790M and , to a lesser extent , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	6	59	None

Based on the data obtained from lung cancer cell lines , we further explored the mechanisms by which T790M and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistant mutations affect BIM up-regulation and apoptosis . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> effectively induced apoptosis in Ba/F3-L858R cells , whereas Ba/F3-L858R-L747S cells were intermediately resistant and Ba/F3-L858R-T790M completely resistant ( A , top ) .	29	20	None

Our data indicate that the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is involved in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced cell death and that the up-regulation of the proapoptotic polypeptide BIM was consistently seen during TKI induced apoptosis . In addition , sustained activation of EGFR , AKT , and/or ERK caused by the T790M and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistant mutations delayed BIM up-regulation and apoptosis .	11	49	None

It is possible to conceive that an increase in the clinical doses of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or switching to erlotinib , which is given at its maximal tolerated dose [ ] , may lead to beneficial clinical effects , possibly by increasing BIM expression , in patients with EGFR mutations who acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> after exposure to gefitinib .	13	50	None

It was initially proposed that the T790M mutation might prevent the proper binding of tyrosine kinase inhibitors via steric hindrance , similar to the corresponding gatekeeper mutations in BCR-ABL ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and KIT ( T670I ) that confer resistance to imatinib ( Gleevec ) in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors .

Pre existing small fractions of mutations become major clones when the tumor becomes resistant to imatinib , probably because of the selection pressure due to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment [ ] . Although rare , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations exist as major clones irrespective of gefitinib administration in certain patients [ , ] .	25	33	None
Analogous secondary mutations of the BCR-ABL gene in case of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) [ ] and the KIT gene in case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor [ ] have previously been reported as mechanisms of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance , which is also a TKI . The structural similarity between ABL and EGFR tyrosine kinases is considerably high , and T315I in ABL corresponds to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR [ ] .	37	65	None

We next asked whether ( 1 ) forced expression of AXL is sufficient to induce <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance and ( 2 ) whether AXL kinase activity is necessary for the induction of erlotinib resistance by AXL . To address these questions , we generated cDNA constructs that encode either wild type ( WT ) AXL or a kinase impaired mutant of AXL in which a key conserved lysine within the kinase domain was changed to arginine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	15	76	None

Together , the data indicate that AXL kinase activation is necessary and sufficient to promote <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in these EGFR mutant NSCLC models . The analysis indicated that an <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in AXL would be expected to result in steric clash with XL-880 and would block the ability of XL-880 to inhibit AXL .	15	29	None
Thus we generated a cDNA encoding this gatekeeper mutant of AXL ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and introduced it into HCC827 cells to determine if expression of it blocks the ability of XL-880 to restore <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity in the setting of AXL overexpression .	33	12	None

Similarly , the co-existence of KRAS and EGFR mutations in the same tumor tissue could be interpreted as either double mutation in the crizotinib-resistant tumor cells or more likely as the occurrence of two different tumor subpopulations with constitutive activation of either the EGFR or the KRAS signaling pathway as different mechanisms of acquired <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Neither of these 2 scenarios could be excluded by the methods used in our molecular analysis . The EGFR mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> has to our knowledge not previously been described in the literature , but given its proximity to mutations known to be sensitive to EGFR-TKI ( L858R and L861X ) , tumor clones bearing the L862R mutation could also be potentially responsive to EGFR-TKI .	54	76	None

Cyclin D1 binds to CDK4 and CDK6 to form a complex , supporting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> transition [ ] . Kastl et al. reported that reduced cyclin D1 expression modulated by miR-34a could induce G1 phase arrest , where docetaxel exerts little cytotoxicity , in turn leading to the resistance of docetaxel in breast cancer cells [ ] . Cyclin D1 is also a target of let-7i , and a chimera that combines Mucin 1 (MUC1) aptamer and let-7i miRNA was proved to reverse <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in EOC cells through down-regulation of cyclin D1 , cyclin D2 , Dicer 1 , and PGRMC1 expressions [ ] .	82	13	None

More recently , in addition to other second-site mutations associated with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D761Y in exon 19 or T854A in exon 21 ) , novel EGFR independent mechanisms have been discovered that contribute to EGFR TKI resistance either in the absence or presence of the EGFR T790M mutation reviewed in . The second well-known mechanism of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance is the MET receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) gene amplification .	64	19	None

Phosphorylation of pRb relieves transcriptional repression by the pRb–E2F complex and disrupts the binding of pRb <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , allowing E2F activation and transcription of genes necessary for S-phase entry and progression . In anti-estrogen-responsive breast cancers , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> causes a reduction in cyclin D1 expression , reducing CDK4/6 activity and promoting p27Kip1/p21Waf1/Cip1 inhibition of CDK2 , resulting in decreased pRb phosphorylation and G1 cell cycle arrest ( ) .	38	16 17	None
Investigation of the underlying mechanisms of cell growth arrest focused on MCF7 cells and its anti-estrogen-resistant derivatives , MMU2 and LCC9 cells , revealed that , in contrast to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , to which only MCF7 cells responded , NU2058 and NU6102 directly reduced pRbpThr821 phosphorylation , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> transcriptional activity and cell growth in all the cells .	29	46	None

Some MEK1 mutations , including the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation identified in a patient 's AZD6244-resistant melanoma , also led to cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors , presumably by causing activation of MEK downstream of BRAF . Interestingly , later work by this same group identified a different MEK1 point mutation ( C121S ) in a post-relapse biopsy from a patient with clinically acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , demonstrating that MEK1 mutations can arise as a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors as well [ ] .	66	6	None

Brain metastasis is observed in approximately 10 % of breast cancer patients , and recurrence is common due to reduced efficiency of chemotherapy drugs , such as doxorubicin and carboplatin , and targeted therapy drugs , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , to cross the blood-brain barrier , . A very recent study showed that the binding of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> to S1PR1 in brain capillaries decreases basal P-glycoprotein transport activity and improves the delivery of therapeutic agents like paclitaxel to the brain .	38	56	None
( C ) Analysis of isogenic cells shows that signalling from the catalytic domain of Raf-1 or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in B-Raf diminishes feedback regulation .

Resistance to tyrosine inhibitors invariably develops , and usually involves development of a gatekeeper mutation in the kinase domain , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in chronic myelogenous leukemia , and T790M in EGFR mutated NSCLC . Similarly , a patient developed resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> after 5 months of treatment and molecular analyses revealed the resistant tumor harbored two acquired but independent mutations within the kinase domain of EML4-ALK , C1156Y , and the gatekeeper mutation L1196M .	42	22	None

The demonstration that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Imatinib mesylate ) , an Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor licensed for the treatment of several cancer forms [ ] , is a poxvirus blocker [ ] and the repurposing of the MEK kinase inhibitor U0126 to block the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade for influenza virus inhibition [ , ] serve as cases in point . While the former originated from the insight that efficient vaccinia virus spread requires phosphorylation of the viral <ANNO_TYPE_variant> protein by Abl and Src family tyrosine kinases [ , ] , the latter was triggered by the observation that influenza virus infection induces the activation of MAPK family members [ , ] .	3	75	None
Since BCL-2 and the mitochondria play an important role in sensitivity to cisplatin , , we determined if the various PXN mutants exhibited a differential response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .

Thus , the aversive effects of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in wild-type mice may be countered by its anxiolytic action especially at lower doses while the lack of such effect in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mice may promote aversion and reduced drinking upon subsequent presentation of the sweetened solution .	6	28	None
Nonetheless , although the observed changes in ethanol induced behaviors in mutant mice likely result from the reduced <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> containing NMDARs , we can not rule out the possibility that these effects may be due to alterations in receptor function that are secondary to the change in ethanol sensitivity .	18	21	None
As a strain of NMDA hypomorph mice are viable despite expressing only 5 % of the normal GluN1 subunit , these results suggest that it is unlikely that the neonatal lethality of homozygous <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants results from insufficient expression of functional NMDA receptors . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 100 mM ) inhibited NMDA currents in neurons from cultures prepared from wild-type ( F/F ) GluN1 mice by approximately 20 % ( ) while having significantly less effect ( ∼7 % inhibition ) on currents in neurons from mice homozygous ( A/A ) for the mutant allele ( one-way ANOVA : main effect of genotype , F ( 2,26 ) = 3.690 , p & lt ; 0.05 ) .	44	33	None

However , it is clear that the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding or mutation induced changes in the microenvironments around Trp residues . Among the four mutants , the D28A and E30A mutations resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in Trp fluorescence , while <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D382A mutations led to an ∼30 % increase .	7	40 41	None
However , inhibitory activities of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in CXCR4 mutants at these positions are dependent on the strain of CXCR4 using HIV-1 . Thus , different CXCR4 using HIV-1s vary in their dependence on residues in one or the other domains . Taken together , it is possible that gp120 with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or M425K might recognize a different portion of the CD4/CXCR4 complex and alter their affinity .	5	50	None

Therefore , the 9HA mutant retains its heme binding capability without the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> residues . At present , however , it is difficult to determine the coordination structure of heme in the 9HA mutant . The spectral changes of the Soret band in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant indicate that His122 is the most probable axial ligand of heme iron in HDP , whereas the position and shape of the Soret band for the H122A mutant was different from that for the 9HA mutant .	12	44	None

Some studies have suggested that low ERCC1 expression is associated with increased chemotherapeutic sensitivity and thus considered a predictive marker for patients with colorectal cancer receiving combination <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and fluorouracil chemotherapy , while other studies indicated that genetic variants in ERCC2 were associated with the increased risk of early relapse in colorectal cancer . Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , as important genetic biomarkers , have been reported to be related with altered gene expression and protein activity . Several SNPs of ERCC1 and ERCC2 have been identified , of which ERCC1 rs11615 and rs3212986 SNPs ( Asn118Asn and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) have some effects on ERCC1 mRNA expression , whereas ERCC2 rs1799793 ( Asp312Asn ) and rs13181 ( Lys751Gln ) SNPs are associated with suboptimal DNA repair capacity .	27	100	None
Other studies have limited their analysis to the effect of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , which has been regarded as the main determinant of disease , but this analysis gives an incomplete and inaccurate representation of the region .

Thus , while flow cytometric analysis suggests no transport of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or rhodamine 123 in cells transfected with wild-type ABCG2 , cross-resistance studies do suggest that wild-type ABCG2 confers a very low level of resistance to these two compounds . All three ABCG2 proteins conferred low levels of resistance to etoposide , while no appreciable resistance to paclitaxel , depsipeptide or flavopiridol was noted . Mutations at amino-acid 482 have included <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and R482T in human cancer cells ; R482S and R482M in mouse fibroblast lines ( ; ) ; and a recently reported R482M mutation in a doxorubicin selected human T-cell line ( ) .	10	71	None

At the worm neuromuscular junction , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation induced resistance to aldicarb implying a reduction in signalling strength .	9	28	None
For the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> phenotype , either the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or E465K unc-18 mutations increased sensitivity .	2	7	None
Most surprisingly , we demonstrate that the epistatic interactions between mutants of unc-18 and rab-3 are distinct depending on the phenotypic context such that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation acts downstream of Rab3 in exocytosis whereas it acts upstream of Rab3 in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity .	40	25	None
In contrast to the previously characterised D214N mutation , the R39C and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations enhanced sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at both the stimulatory and the depressive concentrations ( ) .	17	12	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity phenotypes of single point mutations in unc-18 We recently demonstrated that a single point mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in Munc18 acts biochemically by reducing binding to the assembled SNARE complex and that the orthologous mutation in C. elegans unc-18 ( D214N ) reduces sensitivity to both low and high concentrations of exogenous ethanol [ ] .	0	18	None
In comparison to Wt unc-18 , both the R39C and E465K point mutations increased acute sensitivity to ethanol at ( B ) stimulatory levels ( 21 mM ) and ( C ) depressive levels ( 400 mM ) of external <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . For ( A ) significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc comparisons ; *P & lt ; 0.05 ; N = 28 ( Wt ) , 20 ( R39C ) , 22 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and 20 ( E465K ) .	40	78	None
In vivo evaluation of G-1- and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mediated effects on xenograft tumor growth and testis histopathology Based on in vitro results showing that GPER activation by G-1 exerts anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells , we established R2C xenograft tumors in male immunocompromised mice to investigate the ability of G-1 to control tumor growth in vivo .	6	33	None

The correlation between DNA-PK activity and radiation resistance in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , A172 and U251 cells was determined by the Mann–Whitney U-test . Moreover , the endogenous DNA-PK activity was also measured through detecting the phosphorylation of endogenous replication protein A , whose 32-kDa subunit ( RPA32 ) is differentially phosphorylated by three phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases ( ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) , ATM-Rad3 related , DNA-PK ) in response to different DNA damaging agents . DNA-PK is the primary kinase responsible for RPA32 phosphorylation in response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( CPT ) treatment , , , and thus CPT induced phosphorylation of RPA32 is an indirect measure of DNA-PK activity .	84	9	None

This final <ANNO_TYPE_drug> level ( 1600 μmole gDW-1 ) represents an increase between 10- and more than 1000-fold with respect to previous reports [ , , ] . The expression analysis of this response shows that both elicitors stimulated the expression of PAL , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , 4CL and STS independently of the anthocyanins/isoflavonoids ( CHS ) and lignins ( CCR ) pathways and therefore both induce stilbene biosynthetic genes in a highly specific way , in agreement to results reported by Saigne-Soulard et al.

It was not only found that 5-FU-resistant cells expressed significant higher levels of miR-34a , but also that the introduction of miR-34a into resistant cells significantly inhibited cell growth and induced a considerable attenuation of 5-FU-resistance , which was accompanied by reduced expression of SIRT1 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family proteins . These findings suggest that the resistance to 5-FU in DLD-1 cells was at least in part mediated by miR-34a/SIRT1/E2F3 cascade . Furthermore , also <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance resulted overcome by miR-34a over-expression and SIRT1 knockdown in hormone-refractory PC3 , as demonstrated by Kojima et al .	74	46	None

In addition , the presence of common activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene ( exon 19 deletion and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ) confers strong sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib , which are selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR [ , ] . These EGFR mutations are more commonly encountered in ADCs [ ] .

In clinical studies of metastatic colon cancer , patients with wild type K-ras , B-raf and PIK3CA genes gain benefit from cetuximab therapy [ ] , whilst lung cancer patients with mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene benefit from Iressa or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy . These findings suggest that gene mutation ( s ) may play a key role in resistance to Trastuzumab treatment . After screening for EGFR , K-ras , B-raf and PIK3CA gene mutations in the 5 PDECX mouse models and their corresponding primary tumors , we found that model EC039 ( and the corresponding patient tissue ) had a helical domain mutation ( G1624A , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene ( Figure and Table ) .	45	112	None
JTE-013 ( Ohmori et al. , ) is widely used as a S1P2 antagonist in vitro and is effective in vivo , reducing <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced apoptosis of pancreatic β cells and incidence of diabetes ( Imasawa et al. , ) and IgE triggered anaphylactic responses ( Oskeritzian et al. , ) .

Prior to immunostaining , sections were deparaffinized , hydrated in graded <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and microwave treated for 10 min at 750 W and 15 min at 350 W. Heat induced epitope retrieval was performed by heating the TMA slides immersed in retrieval buffer pH 6 ( Lab Vision , Freemont , CA ) for 4 min at 125°C in a pressure boiler ( Decloaking chamber , Biocare medical ) . Immunostaining was performed by avidin-biotin peroxidase staining technique ( Vector elite ) , using 3,3-diaminobenzidine as a substrate . The presence of heterogeneous cell populations in the TMA was documented using the following immunohistochemical markers : GFAP ( 1∶500 ; polyclonal rabbit , DAKO , Denmark ) , vimentin ( 1∶80 ; Mouse clone V9 , Sigma ) , neuronal nuclear protein ( 1∶1000 ; Mouse clone MAB377 , Chemicon , Temecula , CA ) , microtubule associated protein ( 1∶100 ; Mouse clone HM2 , Sigma ) , CD34 ( 1∶100 ; Mouse monoclonal , DAKO ) , Ki67 ( 1∶500 ; Rabbit polyclonal , DAKO ) , and mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> R132H protein ( 1∶100 ; monoclonal mouse antibody , mIDH1R132 ) .	11	184	None
Interestingly , neither the total amount of FAK protein nor the phosphorylated FAK at Tyr397 changed after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment , suggesting that anti-VEGF therapy might have different effects on the activation of FAK and Pyk2 . It also implicated that FAK and Pyk2 might play differential roles in regulating the biological behavior of glioma cells . Lipinski et al.

However , the development of acquired resistance to imatinib has emerged , most often due to point mutations in the ATP binding sites ( e.g. <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D842V in PDGFRα , T315I in BCR-ABL , D816V in KIT ) [ - ] . Several strategies targeting T315I BCR-ABL including blockade of kinase-addiction by the third-generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] , down-modulation of BCR-ABL by inhibition of heat shock protein [ , ] were documented .	59	25	None
Several compounds have been reported to overcome the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , such as nilotinib [ ] , EXEL-0862 [ ] , PKC412 ( midostaurin ) [ ] , sorafenib [ ] , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] , and DCC-2036 [ ] in vitro .	32	8	None
Pretreatment of animals with DL-propargylglycine (PAG) , a CSE inhibitor , reduced the formation of tissue <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide , decreased the activity of hepatic myeloperoxidase ( a marker for neutrophil infiltration ) and the tissue damage ( ) . In a recent study from our laboratory , we observed that treatment with PAG reduced the renal damage induced by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> injection ( ) .	63	16	None

Indeed , a Par-4 cleaved form was previously reported in human cells during Fas- or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced apoptosis. , Thus , phosphorylation by CK2 on residues S124 and S223 results in loss of rat Par-4 proapoptotic properties and prevents the generation of the caspase mediated cleaved form of Par-4 . We then examined whether Par-4 cleavage was regulated by phosphorylation of S124 by CK2 . We first performed an in vitro caspase assay using purified wild-type Par-4 or its mutants ( S124A , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , S223A , S223D , S124A , S223A or S124D/S223D ) in the presence of recombinant caspases .	15	83	None
In a previous study , 152 patients with exon 19 deletions or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations were analyzed . Even after the failure of first-line gefitinib therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC , subsequent administration of erlotinib as a second-line treatment showed a response rate of 5.6 % [ ] . Therefore , erlotinib may be used as a salvage treatment when treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based regimen and gefitinib fails .	62	12	None
The median survival of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is only 10–11 months with either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based chemotherapy , or customized cisplatin based chemotherapy based on excision repair cross complementing 1 ( ERCC1 ) mRNA expression , and the two-year survival rate is only 14–21 % . , , The two proto-oncogenes currently known to be more commonly mutated in lung adenocarcinoma are K-RAS and EGFR . Lung cancers caused by activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) – mainly either deletion at exon 19 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation at exon 21 – respond to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( gefitinib and erlotinib ) , , , with a recently reported median survival to gefitinib of 17.5 months .	21 22	94 95	None
The expression of a specific KRAS mutation induces a different pattern of sensitivity to anticancer agents : in particular , the expression of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is associated with a reduced response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	31	23	None
A diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma was determined and the patient was treated with first-line chemotherapy consisting of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 80 mg/m2 ) and docetaxel ( 60 mg/m2 ) , every three weeks for up to three cycles .

For example , large phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that ADC is a strong predictive factor for improved outcome following treatment with the combination of pemetrexed with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> compared with SQC [ ] . In addition , the presence of common activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene ( exon 19 deletion and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ) confers strong sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib , which are selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR [ , ] .	28	64	None
In WJTOG3405 , 177 chemotherapy-naïve patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC harboring sensitive EGFR mutations ( either deletion in the exon 19 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in exon 21 ) were randomly assigned to receive either oral gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> plus docetaxel chemotherapy .	38 39	21 22	None
However , no OS benefit was noted between samples harboring or lacking MSH6 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ ] . In contrast , Rellecke et al.

In clinical studies of metastatic colon cancer , patients with wild type K-ras , B-raf and PIK3CA genes gain benefit from cetuximab therapy [ ] , whilst lung cancer patients with mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene benefit from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or Tarceva therapy . These findings suggest that gene mutation ( s ) may play a key role in resistance to Trastuzumab treatment . After screening for EGFR , K-ras , B-raf and PIK3CA gene mutations in the 5 PDECX mouse models and their corresponding primary tumors , we found that model EC039 ( and the corresponding patient tissue ) had a helical domain mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , E542K ) in exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene ( Figure and Table ) .	43	110	None

The observation that U0126 inhibited the Muv phenotype of jgIs25 suggested that some MEK inhibitors may have the potential to inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_drug> forms of EGFR mutations . Therefore , we tested the effects of another MEK inhibitor , PD0325901 , as well as a Raf [ <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ] inhibitor ( AZD6233 ) , and an EGFR [ T790M ] inhibitor ( WZ4002 ) in our model system .	21	46	None
In the current study , a number of cases were reanalyzed for EGFR mutations , including minor mutations , such as exon 20 insertions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 18 ; however , no EGFR mutations were identified in the reanalyzed samples ( results not shown ) , suggesting that erlotinib may be effective in certain patients with EGFR mutation negative NSCLC . Erlotinib inhibits the activity of EGFR mutation negative NSCLC tumor cells at a 50 % inhibitory concentration of 2–20 nmol/l . In EGFR mutation negative NSCLC , it is postulated that erlotinib may bind to the EGFR more readily than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	102	25	None

Finally , we observe , in one sample , the co-occurence of two KRAS mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G12D - Additional file : Table S17 ) , indicating that different populations of KRAS mutated cells can co-exist within one specimen , as previously observed in CRC [ ] .	26	81	None
Of particular importance are recent studies that have demonstrated that subjects with a decreased ABCG2 activity owing to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant are at an increased risk of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced diarrhea [ ] , and altered pharmacokinetics of 9-aminocamptothecin [ ] , diflomotecan [ ] , irinotecan [ ] , rosuvastatin [ ] , sulfasalazine [ , ] and topotecan [ ] .	27	19	None
Approximately 50 % of EGFR mutations consist of deletions in exon 19 , whereas 35–45 % consist of the L858R mutation and 5 % consist of insertions in exon 20 or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation – .

K-ras mutations were found in 66.7 % ( 20/30 ) of tumors from L2G7 treated , 50.0 % ( 7/14 ) of tumors from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treated , and 46.7 % ( 7/15 ) from combination treated animals . The placebo treated and IgG treated groups had identical frequencies of mutation and were combined into one all control group with a 43.6 % ( 17/39 ) K-ras mutant frequency . All mutations found were <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in codon 12 .	24	73	None
In exons 19 and 21 of EGFR , just <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was found without other mutation identified . It was concluded that mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR associated with sensitivity of NSCLC patients to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were not present in Barrett 's adenocarcinoma .	36	9	None
A similar mechanism has been described for a point mutant of the EFGR kinase which causes resistance to the ATP-analogue <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by increasing affinity for ATP . 10.1371/journal.pone.0062564.g008The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the HDM2 lid region is predicted to enhance affinity for p53 but not Nutlin .	20	28	None

For tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) [ ] , mutations within the ATP pocket of the kinase domain may affect the interaction of the drug with its target : for example , the single amino acid mutation tyrosine/methionine ( T790M ) in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR mediates secondary resistance to the EGFR TKIs erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ , ] . The T790M mutation in EGFR is structurally analogous to drug resistance mutations in other kinases such as BCR-ABL ( T315I ) , c-KIT ( T670I ) and platelet derived growth factor receptor-α ( PDGFRα ) <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] .	59	107 108	None
Other less frequent EGFR activating mutations include a glycine-719 change to serine , alanine , or cysteine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 18 and in-frame duplications , insertions , or point mutations in exon 20 ( ) . Kinase domain mutations of the EGFR are referred to as “activating mutations” because they lead to more persistent activation of the TK in response to exogenous growth factors compared with the wild-type receptor . Activating EGFR mutations involve the ATP binding pocket in the receptor TK domain , which is the binding site for erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	94	18	None

Our finding that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> did not lead to reduced TREK-1 expression implies additional regulatory mechanisms governing molecular expression of this channel . Recently , a truncated TREK1 splice variant , TREK1ΔEx4 , has been shown to interfere with the trafficking of wild-type TREK-1 to the membrane , thus causing a functional down-regulation manifest as a decrease in TREK-1 current [ ] .

The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> isoform is predominant in the rat pituitary , striatum , and olfactory tubercle , whereas D2S is more abundant in the hypothalamus.- Activation of either isoform in rat lactotrophs mediates dopamine suppression of the PRL gene . While PRL directly inhibits secretion of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary , there is accumulating evidence that PRL also exerts a direct inhibitory effect on gonadotropin actions in the ovary . Physiological levels of PRL suppress follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) -induced estradiol production through a reduction in aromatase expression and PRL increases <ANNO_TYPE_drug> production by augmenting StAR , P450scc , and 3βHSD expression in granulosa cells .	93	1	None

Therefore , the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells , stably transfected with wild-type ebp1 or the T261A or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants , to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was examined .	21	17	None
Thus , it appears paradoxical that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant is inactive . It is possible that in cells , which weakly express PAK1 ( such as MCF-7 ) ( ) , T261 phosphorylation is low and Ebp1 remains active . In the face of high levels of PAK1 , as is observed in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant cells , Ebp1 becomes heavily phosphorylated , inactivating its function .	53	7	None
In contrast , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant was completely unable to inhibit colony formation . GFP-Ebp1 T261A decreased colony growth to a greater extent than wild-type Ebp1 ( P & lt ; 0.05 ) ( ) . Functional Ebp1 is required for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity	41	4	None

Another example comes from the study of the response of patients with breast cancer to adjuvant tamoxifen ; the p53 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism appears as a predictor of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> response , and the authors suggest that patients with breast cancer lacking the P allele might be candidates for other therapies ( ) .	27	20	None
S1P3 is the most highly expressed <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor in BCCs , , is known to promote cell migration – and EGF responsivity , , , , , and may mediate the proliferative effects of estrogen . In addition to the direct effects that S1P3 have on BCCs , S1P3 also mediates angiogenesis – , thus promoting tumor growth by increasing vascularity . A recent study provided evidence for the clinical importance of S1P3 by showing that expression of S1P3 in breast tumors positively correlates with decreased <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity and decreased patient survival .	86	6	None

Bioactive sphingolipids play a key role in cancer progression , especially for proliferation , migration and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance , . The balance between ceramide , sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate ( and also their dihydro derivates ) is thought to regulate cellular processes , including cell survival , growth and differentiation . Especially sphingosine-1-phosphate <ANNO_TYPE_variant> which is controlled by S1P kinases ( isoforms : Sphk1 , Sphk2 ; biosynthesis ) and S1P lyases ( degradation ) is a well established pro-survival molecule .	16	52	None
The women who had the highest level of soy food intake and no administration of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> had a lower risk of mortality and a lower recurrence rate than women who had the lowest level of soy food intake and used tamoxifen , proposing that high soy food intake and tamoxifen use may have a comparable affection on breast cancer outcomes .

miRNA upregulation has been linked to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and fulvestrant resistance [ , ] . Crosstalk may occur between certain classes of miRNAs such as miR-101 , miR-206 , and miR-221/222 , which translationally repress the estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα ) and could also be responsible for the decreased sensitivity to anti-estrogen drugs [ , , ] . Further , on comparing ERα negative breast cancer cells lines such as MDA-MB 468 , HS578T and MDAMD-231 with ERα positive cell lines such as MCF-7 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and MDA-MB 361 , there was an expressional difference in miR-221 and miR-222 .	6	84 85	None

Interestingly , and not readily understood based on the kinase crystal structures , the potencies of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for EGF– and Cetuximab–bound tEGFRs were found to be within 2-fold of one another . To investigate the effects of cancer associated EGFR mutations on the mechanism and degree of EGFR activation , we examine here the kinase activity of wild-type and mutant EGFRs in the presence and absence of inhibitors targeting different activation states of EGFR . Unexpectedly , we find that EGF independent activation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and Δ746–750 tEGFRs remains strongly dependent on asymmetric kinase dimer formation .	16	84	None
Given their resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and Cetuximab , there appears to be little rationale for the use of these agents in non-small cell lung cancer containing L858R and Δ746–750 EGFR mutations whereas erlotinib’s clinical benefit in these cases is readily understood . Furthermore , targeting cancers with these oncogenic mutations with MIG6 peptidomimetics appears to be a challenging proposition since competition for this dimer interface will be difficult . In future experiments with tEGFRs , it will be interesting to determine the effects of the gatekeeper <ANNO_TYPE_variant> drug resistance mutation on the relative activation and inhibitor sensitivities of these enzymes .	4	86	None
In any event , we believe that our data indicating loss of EGF–dependence <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> reflect the intrinsic properties of the purified oncogenic mutant EGFRs and set a benchmark for analyzing cellular behavior of these molecules . The presence of heterodimers of oncogenic forms of EGFR with WT EGFR or HER2–4 may also affect the ligand-dependency of oncogenic EGFR variants in a cellular context . The studies reported here also enhance our understanding of the paradoxical inhibitory properties of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with WT tEGFR in its EGF– and Cetuximab–bound forms .	79	13 14	None
Several such inhibitors have been approved for use in cancer patients , including gefinitib ( ZD-1839 , Iressa ) , erlotinib ( OSI-774 , Tarceva ) and lapatinib ( GW572016 , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) , , . However , treatment with these reversible TKIs produces objective responses in a rather small subset of patients , possibly corresponding to individuals with activating mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain , such as the L858R mutation , . Despite positive initial response , these patients almost invariably develop acquired secondary resistance , such as substitution of threonine 790 with methionine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , to these reversible inhibitors and relapse after several months , , , which accounts for about half of all cases of resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib , .	31	98	None

In order to further examine the hypothesis that EGFR mutations exert effects in combination that are unique to a specific kinase inhibitor , we further tested the mutant EGFR expressing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> alone or L858R+E884K in-cis , against several other ERBB family tyrosine kinase inhibitors , including both reversible inhibitors ( 4557W , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , GW583340 , Tyrphostin , AG1478 ) and irreversible inhibitor ( CL-387,785 ) ( , and ) .	52	30	None
In MCF10A/HER2/HR cells , a combination of HRG knockdown with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resulted in a marked reduction in pHER2Y1248 and pHER3Y1289 with further inhibition of pAKTS473 compared to lapatinib alone ( ) . The addition of trastuzumab following HRG knockdown did not inhibit pHER2Y1248 or pHER3Y1289 any different than siHRG alone ( ) perhaps explaining why it minimally contributed to the antitumor effect of HRG knockdown in these cells ( ) . This result further suggests that upregulation of HRG in cells expressing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> PI3K amplifies signaling by the ErbB receptor network and reduces the antitumor action of HER2 inhibitors .	10	82	None
Another approach for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance is the dual inhibition of EGFR with afatinib and cetuximab , an EGFR blocking antibody resembling the synergistic combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and trastuzumab in ErbB2 positive breast cancer .	26	3	None
A number of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) ( e.g. , gefitinib , erlotinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) and antibodies ( eg , trastuzumab , cetuximab , panitumumab ) targeting the erbB family have been developed to treat breast , colorectal , lung , gastric and head and neck squamous cell cancers [ ] . Despite the improvements achieved in patients treated with reversible inhibitors of EGFR or EGFR and HER2 , primary and acquired resistances to these agents remain a clinical challenge . This is exemplified by the development of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , through emergence of a secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutation in non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) [ ] , which occurs in 50 % of the patients with lung adenocarcinoma [ ] .	17	107	None
