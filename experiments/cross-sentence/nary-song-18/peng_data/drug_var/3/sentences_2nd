In preclinical studies , cell lines harboring the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation were resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , but were sensitive to irreversible HER2 inhibitor , neratinib .	13	8	sensitivity
Thus , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant reduces the relative efficacy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and causes the development of acquired resistance .	10	3	resistance or non-response
Balak et al reported that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant was found in ~50 % of NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	20	6	resistance or non-response
However , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant was also found in some patients who were not treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and the presence of the T790M mutation was reported to be significantly higher in advanced tumors than in early-stage tumors .	16	3	resistance or non-response
Thus , Inukai et al proposed that , although the detection of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> positive tumor cells may be useful for predicting the clinical efficacy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , gefitinib treatment might result in the selection of T790M mutant cells and that even a small fraction of T790M positive tumor cells at the beginning of treatment could lead to clinical resistance as a result of the selective proliferation of T790M mutant cells .	25	12	resistance or non-response

In addition to the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variation , L747S , D761Y , and G796A variations were identified in NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ; the G796A variant is especially known to cause strong resistance to EGFR-TKIs .	26	7	resistance or non-response
However , careful analysis of the exon 20 sequence chromatograms in both forward and reverse directions from this patient 's lung biopsy specimen obtained after disease progression on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> demonstrated an additional small peak at nucleotide 2369 , suggesting a C→T mutation ( A , upper panels ; ) . This nucleotide change leads to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	28	64	resistance or non-response
This nucleotide change leads to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . The 2369 C→T mutant peak was even more prominent in cells from the patient 's pleural fluid , which were obtained after further disease progression <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( A , lower panels ; ) .	42 43	14	resistance or non-response
The 2369 C→T mutant peak was even more prominent in cells from the patient 's pleural fluid , which were obtained after further disease progression <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( A , lower panels ; ) . Collectively , these findings imply that the exon 20 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was present on the same allele as the exon 21 L858R mutation , and that a subclone of cells harboring these mutations emerged during drug treatment .	25 26	44	resistance or non-response
However , analysis of DNA from cells in the pleural effusion that developed after treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> showed the C→T mutation at nucleotide 2369 in exon 20 ( C , lower panels ; ) , corresponding to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation described above .	16	37 38	resistance or non-response
The mutant 2369 T peak was small , possibly because <ANNO_TYPE_drug> had been discontinued in this patient for 4 mo at the time pleural fluid tumor cells were collected ; thus , there was no selective advantage conferred upon cells bearing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	10	42	resistance or non-response
Collectively , our results suggest that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is associated with lesions that progress while on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib .	17	7	resistance or non-response
Such mutations rarely , if ever , accompany EGFR mutations and are associated with primary resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] . To evaluate the possibility that secondary KRAS mutations confer acquired resistance to these drugs , we performed mutational profiling of KRAS2 exon 2 from tumor specimens from patients 1 to 3 , as well as the three additional patients lacking evidence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	17	66	resistance or non-response
Surprisingly , one cell line—H1975—contained the same C→T mutation at position <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) as described above ( D , lower panel ) . This cell line had previously been shown by others to contain a 2573 T→G mutation in exon 21 ( L858R ) [ ] , which we confirmed ( D , upper panel ) ; in addition , H1975 was reported to be more sensitive <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition than other lung cancer cell lines bearing wild-type EGFR [ ] .	69 70	11 12 13	resistance or non-response
To determine how the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation would affect EGFR proteins already containing mutations associated with sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors , we introduced the specific mutation into EGFR cDNAs that encoded the exon 21 and 19 mutations found in patients 1 and 2 , respectively . Various lysates from cells that were serum starved and pre treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib were analyzed by immunoblotting .	59	4	resistance or non-response
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibited the activity of wild-type and L858R EGFRs progressively with increasing concentrations of drug , as demonstrated by a reduction of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins ( A ) and a decrease in p-EGFR : t-EGFR ratios ( B ) . By contrast , wild-type and mutant EGFRs containing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation did not display a significant change in either phosphotyrosine induction or p-EGFR : t-EGFR ratios ( A and B ) .	0	49	resistance or non-response
These results suggest that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation may impair the ability of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib to inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase activity , even in EGFR mutants ( i.e. , L858R or an exon 19 deletion ) that are clinically associated with drug sensitivity .	12	5	resistance or non-response
Resistance of a NSCLC Cell Line Harboring Both <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L858R Mutations to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or Erlotinib	13	8	resistance or non-response
To further explore the functional consequences of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , we determined the sensitivity of various NSCLC cells lines grown in the presence of either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , using an assay based upon Calcein AM .	26	8	resistance or non-response
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was shown in vitro in the context of wild-type EGFR to confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] and a related quinazoline inhibitor , PD153035 [ ] .	17	1	resistance or non-response
We show here , through molecular analysis of tumor material from three patients and one NSCLC cell line , as well as additional biochemical studies , that acquired clinical drug resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib is indeed associated with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	32	40	resistance or non-response
In tumors from patients not treated with either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , the 2369 C→T mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) appears to be extremely rare .	8	16 17	resistance or non-response
We have not identified this mutation in 155 tumors ( see above ) , and among nearly 1,300 lung cancers in which analysis of EGFR exons 18 to 21 has been performed [ , ,, , , ] , only one tumor ( which also harbored an L858R mutation ) was reported to contain the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Whether the patient from which this tumor was resected had received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib is unclear , and the report did not note an association with acquired resistance to either drug [ ] .	69	55	resistance or non-response
How tumor cells bearing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation emerge within <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib treated patients is a matter of investigation .	9	5	resistance or non-response
In either scenario , treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib subsequently allows these resistant subclones to become apparent , because most cells bearing sensitivity conferring mutations die , while cells with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation persist .	6	31	resistance or non-response
Consistent with this , the H1975 NSCLC cell line reported here to contain both <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L858R did not to our knowledge undergo any prior treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib ; the doubly mutated cells must have become dominant over time through multiple passages in vitro .	27	14	resistance or non-response
This scenario could explain the seemingly contradictory report by others who found the H1975 cell line to be highly sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] ; our H1975 cells could represent a subclone that emerged over time . Analysis of earlier passages of H1975 cells for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation would be informative in this regard .	21	46	resistance or non-response
This study revealed that the quinazoline rings of erlotinib and lapatinib interact differently with the EGFR kinase domain , suggesting that while the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation may affect inhibition by erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , it may not affect inhibition of EGFR by compounds similar to lapatinib .	31	23	resistance or non-response
To our knowledge , no NSCLC patient who initially responded to but then progressed on either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib has yet been treated with lapatinib . In some of the patient specimens analyzed , the actual sequencing peaks demonstrating the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation were smaller than originally anticipated .	16	40	resistance or non-response
Since tumor specimens from three additional patients with acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not demonstrate the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , this specific lesion does not account for all mechanisms of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib .	35	19	resistance or non-response

EGFR Mutants Containing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> Mutation Are Resistant to Inhibition by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or Erlotinib 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type ( WT ) EGFR or EGFR mutants with the following changes : T790M , L858R , L858R + T790M , del L747–E749 ; A750P , or del L747–E749 ; A750P + T790M .	11	4	resistance or non-response
The EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , in conjunction with either wild-type EGFR or the drug-sensitive L858R EGFR mutant , prevents inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation ( A ) or p-EGFR ( B ) by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	32	2	resistance or non-response
Analogously , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , in conjunction with the drug-responsive del L747–E749 ; A750P EGFR mutant , prevents inhibition of p-EGFR by erlotinib ( C ) . Sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> Differs Among NSCLC Cell Lines Containing Various Mutations in EGFR or KRAS	30	3	resistance or non-response
Some 90 % of NSCLC associated mutations occur as either multi-nucleotide in-frame deletions in exon 19 , involving elimination of four amino acids , Leu-Arg-Glu-Ala , or as a single nucleotide substitution at nucleotide 2573 ( T→G ) in exon 21 , resulting in substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . Both of these mutations are associated with sensitivity to the small-molecule kinase inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ , , ] .	69	52 53	sensitivity
The 2369 C→T mutant peak was even more prominent in cells from the patient 's pleural fluid , which were obtained after further disease progression <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( A , lower panels ; ) . Collectively , these findings imply that the exon 20 T790M mutation was present on the same allele as the exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , and that a subclone of cells harboring these mutations emerged during drug treatment .	25 26	56	sensitivity
Such mutations rarely , if ever , accompany EGFR mutations and are associated with primary resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] . To evaluate the possibility that secondary KRAS mutations confer acquired resistance to these drugs , we performed mutational profiling of KRAS2 exon 2 from tumor specimens from patients 1 to 3 , as well as the three additional patients lacking evidence of the T790M mutation .

These results suggest that the T790M mutation may impair the ability of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib to inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase activity , even in EGFR mutants ( i.e. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or an exon 19 deletion ) that are clinically associated with drug sensitivity .	12	29	sensitivity

Several phase 2 studies showed a high response rate ( 55–90 % ) and a prolonged progression-free survival ( of approximately 9 months ) with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in Asiatic patients selected on the basis of the presence of activating EGFR gene mutations [ – ] . The results of these studies are summarized in . Yang and colleagues observed in 43 patients with exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations a response rate of 95 % and 73.9 % and a progression-free survival of 8.9 and 9.1 months , respectively [ ] .	25 26	67	sensitivity
Actually , the response rate was 78 % and 59 % for patients carrying <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and exon 19 deletion , respectively , which are activating mutations , predictive for response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , whereas it was 0 % in patients with atypical mutations .	32	14	sensitivity
For acquired resistance , secondary mutation in the EGFR gene <ANNO_TYPE_variant> – or alternative EGFR independent activation of cell growth signaling pathways including c-Met activation is well-known , . The loss of PTEN expression is one of the acquired resistant mechanisms , which was demonstrated by isolating <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mutants from PC9 cells which harbor activating mutation of EGFR , .	47	10	resistance or non-response

Both erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> show similar kinase inhibition selectivity based on quantitative analysis of small molecule-kinase interaction maps for 38 kinase inhibitors , and show therapeutic efficacy against progressive NSCLC patients – .

The influence of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> administration timing in the treatment of patients with NSCLC has been investigated . In a previous study , 152 patients with exon 19 deletions or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations were analyzed .	3	29	sensitivity
In a previous study , 152 patients with exon 19 deletions or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations were analyzed . Even after the failure of first-line <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC , subsequent administration of erlotinib as a second-line treatment showed a response rate of 5.6 % [ ] .	23	12	sensitivity
An objective response rate of 25 % for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment was reported in 16 patients with exon 20 mutations , and it was much lower than the response rate of patients with deletions in exon 19 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations .	8	37	sensitivity
Furthermore , three of the four responders with exon 20 mutations also had concurrent sensitizing EGFR mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] . According to previous studies , the average response rate for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment in patients with exon 20 mutations was only 34 % .	33	18	sensitivity
However , treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib will eventually fail because of the development of acquired drug resistance resulting from amplification of the MET proto-oncogene or the threonine-to-methionine amino acid substitution at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) of EGFR , which is detected in 50 % of clinically resistant patients , .	4	35	resistance or non-response
We found a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mimetic , N- ( 2-bromo-5- ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ) -6-methoxy-7- ( 3- ( piperidin-1-yl ) propoxy ) quinazolin-4-amine ( hereafter , V1801 ) , moderately inhibited EGFR kinase activity but significantly suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR harboring non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells in vitro and in vivo .	3	43	resistance or non-response
To overcome such drug resistance , novel mutant-selective EGFR kinase inhibitors against EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> were reported , and 4-pyrrylamino quinazolines as new <ANNO_TYPE_drug> analogues were synthesized .	22	13	resistance or non-response
In this study , we design , synthesize and evaluated a number of novel quinazoline derivatives by exchanging the positions of the C5 and C6 substituents and varying the C4-amino functionality of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and report that compound V1801 having a trifluoromethyl group at the C5'-position and a bromine at the C2'-position of the aniline moiety substituted at the C4 position of quinazoline core overcomes gefitinib resistance via up-regulation of Noxa , suggesting a novel strategy to fight against NSCLC with EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	32	82	resistance or non-response

Compared with the parental compound <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , V1801 is a relatively weak EGFR inhibitor which bears a much more potent cytotoxicity in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR harboring NCI-H1975 cells ( ) .	5	22	resistance or non-response
Approximately 70–80 % of NSCLCs harbouring a somatic mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene respond <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , , . However , acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy almost always develops after a median of approximately 10 months from the onset of treatment , even in patients who exhibit an initial dramatic response to these agents . Acquired resistance has been associated with a secondary mutation in the EGFR gene , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , , which has been detected in approximately 50 % of cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs , .	19 20	74	resistance or non-response
The secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was not detected in the HCC827/GR and HCC827/ER cell lines by sequencing ( data not shown ) . To assess the inhibitory effects of EGFR-TKIs on MET further , EGFR and their downstream signals , HCC827 , HCC827/GR and HCC827/ER cells were treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib for 72 h .	48	2	resistance or non-response
Previously , we established <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cells ( PC-9/GR ) from PC-9 cells . Although PC-9/GR cells acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance , decreased expression of IGFBP-3 was also found in them ( Supplementary ) .	4	17	resistance or non-response
Incidentally , we found MST to be better in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cases . As reported by , RR was more favourable among the exon 19 deletion cases . Although this was conceivably due to factors including the ILD being experienced in two cases with exon 19 deletion and the impact of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment , the relatively small sample did not allow for any clarification in this respect .	50	9	sensitivity
Preclinical studies have shown superior activity of afatinib over first-generation TKIs , mainly due to ( 1 ) irreversible binding , which confers stronger binding affinity and potency , ( 2 ) ability to circumvent first-generation TKI resistance mechanism <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 20 , and ( 3 ) effectiveness against multiple HER-endothelial growth factor receptors . Recently , TKIs have been investigated in eight phase 3 trials as first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR activating mutations , in comparison with platinum based chemotherapy doublets : <ANNO_TYPE_drug> trials IPASS , , West Japan , North-East Japan , , and First-SIGNAL ; erlotinib trials OPTIMAL , and EURTAC ; and afatinib trials LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 .	89	39	resistance or non-response
One of the proposed mechanisms of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib is the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation on exon 20 .	8	13	resistance or non-response
As the theoretical advantage of afatinib versus the first-generation EGFR-TKI did not translate into progression-free survival gains , maybe the clinical relevance of possible inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is minimal , at least in the first-line setting , when T790M positive clones are rarely detected . A limitation of our study is the indirect comparison of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , and afatinib with one another , which relies on the quality of variance component estimates .	55	26	resistance or non-response
However , subsequent resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is inevitable even among the initial good responders , mostly related to acquired EGFR mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) or c-met amplification [ , ] .	5	22	resistance or non-response
An acquired EGFR mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) has been reported to occur upon failure of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and is also predictive of resistance to erlotinib [ , ] .	15	5	resistance or non-response
However , the acquired resistance is not completely explained by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in all cases [ ] . The presence of heterogenous malignant clones with different EGFR mutation status may confer differential sensitivity to the two EGFR-TKIs [ ] . Also , the different treatment efficacy between the two EGFR-TKIs has been proposed to be related to drug pharmacokinetics [ ] , with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> given at largely sub-maximal tolerated dose ( MTD ) in contrast to erlotinib at MTD .	64	11	resistance or non-response
EGFR mutation tests were available in four patients , in whom three of them were positive for point mutation in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L861Q ) and one was negative . At the time of initiation of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment , most of the patients were in good performance status ( & gt ; 90 % in ECOG 0 or 1 ) .	38	23	sensitivity
The detection rate of EGFR mutation positive status among patients with evaluable tumour samples was 13.7 % ( 118 out of 859 ) ; 65.1 % of patients with a positive EGFR mutation status had tumours with exon 19 deletions and 31.1 % with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutations . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment was started in 107 patients , of whom 106 had activating , sensitising EGFR mutations and one had a resistant EGFR mutation .	48	44	sensitivity
As in our study , iTARGET and EURTAC reported generally mild to moderate AEs ( rash and diarrhoea ) , although 13 % of patients ( 11 out of 84 ) in EURTAC did experience grade-3/4 rash with erlotinib ( there were no grade-3/4 rash events with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> reported in our study ) . Mutation subtype analysis results in iTARGET and EURTAC were also similar to our study , with exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> the most common mutation subtypes detected .	47	74	sensitivity
More than 50 % of lung adenocarcinomas (LAD) from East Asian non-smokers harbor EGFR mutations , and these tumors have been termed oncogene addicted to reflect their dependence on EGFR mediated pro-survival signaling and their high susceptibility to apoptosis induced by EGFR-TKIs ( e.g. <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib ) ( ) . The most frequently occurring mutations in the EGFR gene ( in-frame deletion in exon 19 at codons 746–750 or a single-base <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 ) predict an improved clinical response to first-line oral EGFR-TKIs compared with standard platinum based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) ( , ) .	44	72 73	sensitivity
Emerging data suggest that patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 deletion have a longer survival following treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib compared with those with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ – ] .	19	26	sensitivity

Moreover , dacomitinib showed significant effects in vitro and in vivo against NCI-H1975 cells containing the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , T790M mutation .

However , Yun et al. ( 2008 ) showed that both the single <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant and the double-mutant L858R/T790M maintain the same low nanomolar affinity for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as the L858R mutant .	26	13	resistance or non-response
By contrast , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation confers a higher affinity toward ATP than the L858R mutant such that the combined double mutant L858R/T790M results in an activated enzyme that is resistant to ATP-competitive TKIs . Recent report by Yoshikawa , S. et al.

Our analysis revealed that the T790M mutation significantly increased the distance between the P-loop and activation loop , whereas the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation significantly shortened the distance between the P-loop and activation loop ( ) .

By contrast , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation increased the distance between residues L718 and G796 . For DM , distance was found to be lowest when compared to WT and the other mutations . The decreased distance between L718 and G796 lead to a smaller slot in the hydrophobic region , which in turn facilitated the exclusion of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> from the binding pocket .	57	4	sensitivity

Furthermore , the NSCLC cell line H1975 harbors both the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T790M mutations , and is resistant to inhibition by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , unlike cell lines that express the L858R allele alone .	21	10	sensitivity
A ribbon structure of erlotinib bound to the EGFR kinase domain ( ) shows the threonine residue at position 790 in green and the positions of the exon 19 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gain-of-function mutations . These observations provide convincing evidence that , at least in some patients with NSCLC , resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib can be attributed to acquisition of a T790M mutation in the context of EGFR .	51	30	sensitivity
The authors sequenced exons 18–21 of the EGFR gene using DNA extracted from tumor and normal lung tissue obtained at a previous resection : <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was detected . This point mutation in the activation loop of the kinase domain is linked to erlotinib responses [ ] . In a phase II trial , Ceresoli and colleagues assessed the efficacy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in 41 patients with NSCLC metastatic to the brain .	62	24 25	sensitivity
Many tumours with intrinsic resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were found to have wild-type EGFR and/or mutant KRAS . At present , no FDA approved inhibitor drugs have been shown to be successful in overcoming <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance clinically .	6	33	resistance or non-response
Acquired MET amplification was identified to be a potential alternative mechanism to enable the mutant EGFR expressing HCC827 to become secondarily resistant ( HCC827-GR ) without a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . In the course of our study , reported the presence of MET amplification that occurred independently with and without T790M-EGFR mutation in lung tumours . Interestingly , another recent report adopted a global phosphoproteomic approach using cell lines sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( HCC827 ) and sensitive to SU11274 ( MKN45 ) , and showed that besides p-EGFR inhibition , gefitinib also inhibited p-MET ( that is indeed constitutively activated ) in HCC827 , but not vice versa ( ) .	70	27	resistance or non-response

H1975 cell line was chosen because it expresses the ‘gatekeeper'-resistant T790M-EGFR mutation ( in-cis <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the receptor kinase domain hydrophobic pocket , representing a major mechanism of resistance to reversible EGFR-TKI ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) ( ; ) .	35	14 15	sensitivity
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation accounts for approximately 50 % of cases in which acquired resistance to erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> occurs , , .	17	1	resistance or non-response
EGFR TKIs ( such as erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) are selective inhibitors of EGFR 's kinase domain that work by competing with ATP for binding at the ATP binding site , thereby preventing autophosphorylation and activation . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation affects the gatekeeper residue in the catalytic kinase domain and confers drug resistance by increasing EGFR 's affinity for ATP – thus reducing the potency of the ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors .	7	38	resistance or non-response
Of note , mutations within ALK that lead to crizotinib resistance have already been described , analogous to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation leading to erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in EGFR .	25	19	resistance or non-response
In 40 patients harboring L858R , five revealed complex mutations , including two with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . In 61 patients with EGFR TKI as first-line therapy , 46 received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , 13 received erlotinib , and two received afatinib .	28	14	resistance or non-response

After re-introduction of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , 25 % achieved partial remission and 75 % showed DCR . A different response to the same EGFR-TKI regimen after a drug holiday can be explained with tumor heterogeneity . In a retrospective analysis of an erlotinib retrial , Becker et al. [ ] reported five cases of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and exon 19 deletions in rebiopsy specimens taken before the retrial of erlotinib .	3	54	resistance or non-response
The ability of irreversible pan-HER inhibitors such as afatinib and dacomitinib to overcome <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has been demonstrated in some preclinical studies ; therefore , they are being actively investigated .	17	13	resistance or non-response
In our case , DNA sequencing of the EGFR gene in a tumor biopsy specimen at relapse showed a second point mutation that changed threonine to methionine at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) of EGFR . The efficacy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is of limited duration , mainly due to drug resistance conferred by a second point mutation .	39	31	resistance or non-response
Unfortunately , even in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> responders , disease progression occurs and is inevitable . Some reports present that despite initial responses , patients eventually progress by unknown mechanisms of “acquired” resistance , a secondary mutation in exon 20 , which leads to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the kinase domain [ ] .	4	50 51	resistance or non-response

More than 4 months after the discontinuation of the initial <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment , the patient was retreated with gefitinib due to further progression of the disease .	56	36 37	resistance or non-response

Thus , the patient began to take <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at 250 mg/day because EGFR gene analysis in this patient showed a deletion mutation in exon 19 and point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 by direct sequence method ( ) .	7	28	sensitivity
In addition , Cadranel et al [ ] demonstrated that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is suitable as a first-line treatment for advanced adenocarcinoma , particularly in patients with lepidic predominant subtype . Our case showed deletion mutation in exon 19 and point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 as well as pathologically lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma .	10	40	sensitivity
The most common lesion is the so-called “gatekeeper mutation” , which involves a substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . The second well-known mechanism of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib is the amplification of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) gene , which activates downstream intracellular signaling independently of EGFR .	32	21 22	resistance or non-response
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> and MET amplification account for approximately 60–70 % of all known causes of acquired resistance <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib ; these amplifications are not mutually exclusive and can be detected in the same resistant tumor or may occur independently in different metastatic sites in the same patient .	16 17	0	resistance or non-response
For example , Caucasian patients harboring activating mutations in the EGFR kinase domain , such as a deletion in exon 19 or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , have shown significant responses to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) erlotinib , including a 70 % response rate , 14-month progression-free survival , and 27-month median survival . Accordingly , the EGFR TKIs erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> have become the standard of care for first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC and whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR .	62	22	sensitivity
The research article by Pao et al. [ ] provides important new information addressing three patients with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib in progressing tumors containing a secondary mutation , leading to the substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 20 .	20	43	resistance or non-response

The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is rarely found in tumors from patients not treated with either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , and could be discovered only in progressing tumors , in addition to a primary drug-sensitive mutation in EGFR .	14	1	resistance or non-response
A non-small-cell lung cancer cell line bearing both <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L858R mutations was approximately 100-fold less sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , and did not show inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro [ ] .	18	8	resistance or non-response
Pao et al. and Kobayashi et al. identified four cases with lung adenocarcinoma harboring pre existing mutations of EGFR as delL747–E749 plus A750P , delE746–A750 , or delL747–S752 , prior to the use <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ , ] . All of them had exposure to previous systemic chemotherapies and took a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor as the second- or third-line therapy , then all acquired a second mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in the following months after disease progression .	33 34	70	resistance or non-response
In the case of our patient , the patient received no prior systemic chemotherapy , and we identified an initial <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitizing L858R EGFR mutation , followed by a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation concomitantly with L858R in the biopsy taken from the growing tumor nine months after gefitinib use .	20	29	resistance or non-response

Afatinib , an EGFR and HER2 irreversible inhibitor has been shown to reverse the effects of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in preclinical lung cancer studies [ ] .

EGFR gene mutations indicate sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and it was demonstrated that about 85 % of patients with NSCLC who obtained benefit from gefitinib treatment were found to have mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene [ - ] . EGFR mutations in exon 19 ( short in-frame deletions ) or 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( point mutation ) affect the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain leading to the activation of 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds , which function to compete with ATP [ ] .	6	61	sensitivity

Deletion in exon 19 , which removes the conserved sequence LREA , and a single point mutation in exon 21 , which leads to the substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , are the most clinically relevant and extensively studied drug-sensitive mutations [ ] . Studies have shown that these mutations preferentially bind to first generation EGFR-TKIs , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib [ , ] .	63	34	sensitivity
To test this hypothesis and to clinically validate our preclinical findings , we measured the expression of AXL by IHC ( immunohistochemistry ) in 35 matched EGFR-mutant NSCLC specimens obtained from patients both prior to treatment with the EGFR TKIs erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and upon the development of EGFR TKI acquired resistance . In cases where enough material was available for additional studies , we also examined the specimens for GAS6 and vimentin ( as a marker for EMT ) expression by IHC ( scoring system shown in ) , EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> by sequencing , and MET amplification by FISH .	42	91	resistance or non-response
Our analysis of the clinical specimens shows that AXL upregulation is the second most common mechanism of EGFR TKI acquired resistance ( after EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs that has been validated using primary human data . Importantly , we found upregulation of AXL in patients that developed resistance to both EGFR TKIs ( erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) that are clinically approved for use in NSCLC patients worldwide .	57	24	resistance or non-response
Another second-generation irreversible EGFR TKI , dacomitinib , demonstrated preclinical efficacy in NSCLC tumours harbouring the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutation , , which is present in ∼50 % of NSCLCs that have acquired resistance to erlotinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , .	35 36	16	resistance or non-response
In addition , the presence of common activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene ( exon 19 deletion and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ) confers strong sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , which are selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR [ , ] .	36	29	sensitivity
Interestingly , studies on different lung cancer cell lines suggested that NCI-H292 , a pulmonary MEC cell line that has wild-type EGFR , is more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than other wild-type EGFR non-small cell lung cancer cell lines [ ] . O'Neill analyzed the data from multiple studies and raised the interesting question that different ethnic populations may have different EGFR mutations in their pulmonary MEC tumors [ ] . Per review of the literature , 48 pulmonary MEC tumors were tested for EGFR mutations , and nine tumors ( 19 % ) tested positive for mutations including two reports of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations , five L861Q mutations , one I760I mutation , and one exon 19 deletion .	27	101	sensitivity

Phosphorylation of both AKT and MAPK was abrogated in the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , demonstrating its dependency on EGFR activation ( data not shown ) . Constitutive activation of HER family members prevent the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of MET inhibition The most common EGFR activating alterations in human tumors are receptor point mutations ( such as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , [ ] ) and the onset of TGFα autocrine production [ , ] .	12	60	sensitivity

In NSCLC , approximately 85 % of patients who responded favourably to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , two FDA approved small-molecule EGFR-tyrosine-kinase inhibitors , were shown to have somatic mutations in the EGFR gene . Somatic EGFR mutations are primarily located in exons 18 through 21 around the ATP binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain [ - ] . The most common mutations are short deletions in exon 19 affecting the amino acid sequence LREA ( DelE746-A750 ) or a point mutation in exon 21 resulting in the amino acid change <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	12	91	sensitivity
For example , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancers has been shown to be mediated in some cases by the selection of cancer cells harboring the EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) gatekeeper mutation and/or MET gene amplification [ ] .	3	33	resistance or non-response
Most patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC receive an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( e.g. <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , or afatinib ) as first-line therapy , and unfortunately most patients experience disease progression after approximately 10–15 months of treatment . The most common mechanism of resistance is an EGFR exon 20 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , which is detected in approximately 50–60 % of tumor samples when a biopsy is performed after disease progression on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors [ , ] .	14	50	resistance or non-response
As previously demonstrated [ , , ] , cells with the deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R were inhibited by the TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , while the exon 20 insertion mutation was resistant . Three patients with lung adenocarcinoma and with exon 20 deletion mutants of EGFR failed to show a clinical response ( contrary to the expectation that , since the general response rate of tumors with EGFR mutations to TKIs is about 80 % , two or all three of these particular ones would be responsive ) . However , the cells with the insertion mutation demonstrated increased sensitivity to the irreversible inhibitor CL-387,785 , previously demonstrated to be active against cells with both an activating mutation and the resistance associated point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> on exon 20 .	23	127	resistance or non-response

Erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and have been studied extensively . Since Lynch et al. have identified specific activating mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR [ ] , the missense mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 and the in-frame deletion in exon 19 , nested around the amino acid residues 747 to 750 of the EGFR polypeptide , account for & gt ; 85 % of all clinically important mutations related to TKI sensitivity [ ] .	2	38	sensitivity
Furthermore , there are three small-molecule inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase domain ( TKIs ) that interfere with the binding of ATP , also approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer ( i.e. , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , and lapatinib ) [ ] . These therapeutic molecules are limited by the development of resistance mutations such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR , which necessitates the screening of new inhibitors .	34	57	resistance or non-response
The EGFR mutations are distributed throughout the kinase domain , but a deletion in exon 19 and the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 account for approximately 90 % , which confer a greater response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment , compared with other types of EGFR mutations .	36	20	sensitivity
EGFR-TKI ( such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib ) treatment of lung-cancer harboring EGFR gene mutation is one of the prototypes of such therapies . Several clinical trials clearly demonstrated that progression-free survival of patients treated with EGFR-TKI therapy is significantly longer than that of those treated by conventional platinum doublet chemotherapy.– EGFR-TKI therapy dramatically changed the paradigm of lung cancer treatment . Which strategy is better in the management of advanced NSCLCs – the inhibition of mutated EGFR with TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation increases tyrosine kinase affinity for TKIs ) or a combined approach with cetuximab ( an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody ) plus first-line chemotherapy – is yet to be determined .	4	80 81	sensitivity
The interaction between TM4SF5 and EGFR is observed by a co-immunoprecipitation approach using NSCLC expressing TM4SF5 , where the interaction is positively correlated with the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance even without EGFR mutation ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following TM4SF5 overexpression .	25	34	resistance or non-response

The two most common genetic mutations are the in-frame deletion in exon 19 ( E746-A750 ) and the substitution of leucine 858 by arginine in the exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . These two mutations constitute about 90 % of all mutations and are known as the “classical” mutations . These two EGFR-specific mutations are strong predictors of the response to small-molecule EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and erlotinib .	67	29	sensitivity
Most of the mutations are in frame deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] . A deletion between codons 746 and 750 accounts for 65–75.5 % of the deletions in exon 19 [ ] . Erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are compounds that reversibly inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and have been employed in the treatment of patients with NSCLC .	46	19	sensitivity

The most commonly seen activating point mutation in EGFR , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , is incompatible with the inactive state of the kinase [ , ] , and the crystal structure of the L858R mutant revealed that additional hydrogen bonds are formed which serve to further stabilize the active state of the kinase [ ] . The mechanism by which this and other mutations activate EGFR , however , is not completely explained by a conformational predisposition to the active-state . Kinetic analyses found that clinically relevant mutations in EGFR alter binding to both ATP and inhibitors ( e.g. <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and imatinib ) in such a way that the ratio of Kd to Km [ ATP ] is altered in favor of the inhibitors [ - ] .	97	10	sensitivity
Median PFS and OS for the 217 patients who received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were 14 and 27 months , patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> had longer PFS than patients with exon 19 deletions and outcomes did not seem to differ whether erlotinib was given in the first or second-line setting .	10	19	sensitivity

As compared to the large number of secondary resistance mutations noted in acquired imatinib resistance in CML , in the case of EGFR-TK , there are currently only several documented resistance point mutations to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ , ] , L747S [ ] and D761Y [ ] .	36	39	resistance or non-response
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation results in alteration of the topology of the ATP binding pocket not only interrupting the physicochemical binding of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , but also leading to much increased affinity of the EGFR protein to ATP resulting in resistance to EGFR-TKIs [ ] .	21	1	resistance or non-response
Given that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and MET amplification collectively account for approximately 60 % of the acquired resistance cases , there are clearly additional mechanisms that underlie resistance to EGFR TKIs . Other mechanisms that have been implicated in acquired resistance include overexpression of AXL tyrosine kinase receptor [ ] , altered EGFR trafficking [ ] , expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 [ ] , amplification of mutant EGFR or hyperactivation of components of downstream signaling pathways [ ] , and expression of the ABCG2 drug-efflux transporter [ ] . Recently , it has been shown that activation of TGF-β/IL-6 signaling leads to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance [ ] .	103 104	2	resistance or non-response
These measured changes in apparent Ki therefore provide a mechanism for selective inhibition of mutant EGFR by small molecules such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and imatinib [ ] . Alterations in ATP dependent reaction rates and inhibitor binding affinities are probably the mechanism for acquired resistance by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] .	21	46	resistance or non-response

E.g. one study of CTCs from lung cancer patients was able to identify EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in CTCs of some patients and progression-free survival was shorter as one might expect in patients with than without T790M on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	36	14	resistance or non-response
In adenocarcinoma tumor samples from never smokers , a Memorial Sloan Kettering group similarly identified EGFR mutations that were associated with sensitivity to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib belong to the first generation of TKIs and have reversible binding features . The principal predictive factor for response to such drugs is the presence of somatic “activating” mutations in the EGFR gene that cause an aberrant and constitutive activation of the receptor at the membrane level , resulting in a growth advantage of tumor cells through the activation of Ras/MAPK , PI3K/Akt , and STAT signaling pathways . In about 50 % of cases , a secondary mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is supposed to be responsible for resistance. , Other mechanisms involve MET gene amplification ( 5 % –20 % ) ,	0	83	resistance or non-response

However , it is unknown whether the status of EGFR mutation and downstream resistance related genes aberrances ( i.e. , KRAS mutations , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , or c-MET amplification ) are consistent in pre- and post-chemotherapy samples . Therefore , it is necessary to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on tumor molecular profiles .

Sequist et al performed a longitudinal analysis of genetic and phenotypic changes in 37 patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> NSCLCs carrying EGFR mutations .

Alternatively , the selective resistance hypothesis suggests that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation might exist in patients as small clones prior to treatment ; these resistant clones may proliferate after exposed to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	32	9	resistance or non-response
One important issue raised by this case concerns acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .

The EGFR mutation L862R has to our knowledge not previously been described in the literature , but given its proximity to mutations known to be sensitive to EGFR-TKI ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L861X ) , tumor clones bearing the L862R mutation could also be potentially responsive to EGFR-TKI . Meanwhile , because of rapid worsening while waiting for these new molecular tests the patient received third-line pemetrexed , showing further progression in abdomen and pelvis , but still no sign of relapse in the thorax .

Nevertheless , the possibility of treating the patient with the EGFR-TKI <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was considered . Indeed , even if the co-existence of KRAS and EGFR mutations could be interpreted as double mutation occurring in the crizotinib-resistant tumor cells , the possibility of different tumor clones with activation of EGFR and KRAS signaling as different mechanisms of crizotinib-resistance appeared to be an alternative , perhaps more likely explanation .

Somatic mutations in the EGFR gene have been identified as a major determinant of the clinical response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , such as gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , in patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Most of the EGFR mutations occur in exons 19 to 21 , which encode the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor . Deletions in exon 19 ( such as delE746-A750 ) and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in exon 21 are the commonest mutations found in NSCLC , accounting for about 90 % of all EGFR mutations .	32	78	sensitivity

One of the most critical mechanisms for acquired resistance is the gatekeeper EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutation , which is found in approximately 49 % –63 % of patients who have developed resistance to EGFR inhibitors. , Preliminary studies also indicate that the T790M mutation may play a crucial role in primary resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors because of clonal evolution in tumor cells with preexisting T790M mutations . Different strategies have been pursued in the management of progressive disease after treatment with first-generation EGFR TKIs , including monotherapies such as dasatinib and neratinib , as well as the rational combinations of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> plus erlotinib and of erlotinib/gefitinib plus everolimus .	101	13	response

<ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα , analogous to T315I Bcr-Abl in CML , is also resistant to the second-generation TKIs , such as nilotinib . Novel agents for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> HES are needed .	25	0	resistance
Because the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant in HES mainly contributes to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , , we explored whether DCC-2036 could inhibit PDGFRα in FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive cells regardless of the mutational status .	10 11	2 3	resistance
B , EOL-1 cells and BaF3 cells expressing WT or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα were treated with DCC-2036 for indicated durations with different concentrations ( 6 nM for EOL-1 cells , 400 nM for BaF3 cells ) , the phosphorylated and total levels of indicated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting . C , BaF3-T674I cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of DCC-2036 , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or sorafenib for 36 h , the phosphorylated PDGFRα and total PDGFRα were analyzed by immunoblotting .	62	10	resistance
Because tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib was effective for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation cells , we also compared the inhibitory effect of DCC-2036 with sorafenib in the BaF3-T674I cells .	8	9 10	resistance

Several mutations in the kinase domains such as D842V , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , S601P and L629P , have been demonstrated to be responsible for the drug-resistance .	20 21	46	resistance

Moreover , inhibitory effect of DCC-2036 was comparable to sorafenib in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation cells . In this study , we have also shown for the first time that Bim is essential for DCC-2036 mediated apoptosis in FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive cells . Taken together , DCC-2036 may be a promising agent for treating FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive HES which is resistant <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	59 60	12 13	resistance

After treatment of cells with increasing doses of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , we observed a similar inhibition of HER2 phosphorylation in parental and resistant cells , but the resistant cells with an acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation showed only very limited inhibition of PI3K signaling as measured by Akt and S6 phosphorylation ( Figure C ) .	8	31	sensitivity
Similarly to BT474 LR cells with acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , cells with the other hotspot mutations showed a blunted inhibitor response of PI3K signaling to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with persistent PI3K-Akt signaling ( Figure A ) .	25	7	sensitivity
Interestingly , we observed a similar increase in the IC50 for pAkt and pS6 in the LR BT474 cells with an acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( Additional file : Figure S3 ) .

We suspected that internalization was driven by direct interaction between <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and the ATP binding pocket of c-Kit .

As expected , the expression of the mature form of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> c-Kit mutant was down regulated in the presence of sorafenib . These data indicate that the accessibility of the ATP pocket is crucial for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced c-Kit internalization process .	35	10	resistance

Indeed , up to 10 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was ineffective to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant –driven cell proliferation , while kinase inhibitor sorafenib , which inhibits wt c-Kit at a concentration of 5 µM efficiently reduced this proliferation [ 27,33 and our data not shown ] .	5 6	10 11	resistance 
The striking stability of our gene expression results on PDGFRA mutated tumors could be explained by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation found on 4/5 samples . The fifth tumor exhibited an exon 10 polymorphism and had expression values in the range of exon 18 mutated tumors . The response to targeted therapies , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and sunitinib , is also dependent of the type of mutation , , .	53	17	resistance or non-response

In a recent report , the c-KIT mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was associated with resistance to multiple KIT inhibitors including <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , nilotinib , and sorafenib , but objective tumor responses could be induced in 2 patients bearing the KIT L576P mutation after treatment with dasatinib .	18	8	resistance or non-response
The most common point mutation is <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 11 , but point mutations also occur in exons 13 , 17 , and 18 .

Therefore , Phase II trials were conducted with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients with acral or mucosal melanoma or melanomas on chronically sun damaged skin that harbored KIT mutations or amplifications . Response rates of 16 % –23 % with a small number of complete long-term responses have been seen , with no difference in response rates between the various melanoma subtypes.– Notably , the same KIT mutations ( K642E and N822K ) that have shown response to treatment in gastrointestinal stromal tumors also show response in the treatment of melanoma . Meanwhile , resistance to specific KIT mutations ( V654A and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) are observed in both gastrointestinal stromal tumors and melanoma .	8	100	response

Approximately 40 % of patients with mucosal melanoma have c-kit aberrations in exons 11 , 13 , and 17 , and clinical responses , including CR 's , were seen in these patients after treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , , , . Notably , a recent case report documented a PR in a patient with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 17 of KIT who was treated with sorafenib .	36	55	response
Analysis of the cell-free tumor DNA samples at PD in patient 1 and 2 showed the presence of the KRAS mutation G12V while in patient 3 the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was detected . Interestingly , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cell-free tumor DNA was positive for KRAS mutant alleles for patients 2 and 3 , but was not sufficient to test the mutational status of KRAS in patient 1 .	34	27	sensitivity
Ihle et al. demonstrated that a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation activates both PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways , whereas a G12C mutation causes robust RAL signaling . The prevalence of NRAS mutations was higher than reported in other studies or in the COSMIC database ( 14–20 % ) . , BRAF mutations have been mainly reported in melanoma , colorectal , papillary thyroid , and ovarian cancer. , In colorectal cancer they are associated with a dismal prognosis , however , unlike KRAS mutations , BRAF mutations might not be predictive of lack of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> benefit .	91	6	sensitivity
Similarly , our case demonstrated BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , wild-type KRAS and no evidence of microsatellite instability on immunohistochemical workup . However , we did not assess our case for CpG island methylation status . From the therapeutic standpoint , wild-type KRAS status would imply tumor responsiveness to novel biological molecules such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) compounds ; however , a BRAF mutation and rhabdoid morphology would signify the opposite : a poor response to conventional and novel chemotherapy regimens and a likely refractory disease with relapses .	53	6	sensitivity
Using a representative cohort of 229 sporadic CRCs , we identified the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation as an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with advanced and recurrent CRC . The presence of the BRAF mutation is associated with a significantly higher risk of dying of cancer related causes , independently of other factors such as age , gender , PS , KRAS status , pathological finding , number of metastasis and metastatic sites , in agreement with other recent studies ( ; ; ; ) . However , our study focused on the advanced and recurrent group who received systemic chemotherapy , including fluoropyrimidines , in combination with oxaliplatin , irinotecan , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and anti-EGFR antibody in several lines .	113	13	sensitivity
Acquired resistance EGFR mutations Mutations in the EC domain ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and in the kinase domain ( codons 714 and 794 ) of EGFR found in patients <ANNO_TYPE_drug> remained active in a patient with S492R mutation , which abrogated cetuximab binding .	28	10	response

Indeed , Montagut et al. [ ] identified the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in 2 out of 10 tumors from patients with cetuximab resistance , and those 2 tumors showed good response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	31	9	response
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was not found in our patient ; it seems that the expression of the mutation does not occur at a high frequency . Validation of the available evidence and clarification of its clinical significance through clinical studies is anticipated . In summary , the present case implies that there are likely to be multiple or unknown mechanisms of drug resistance of EGFR targeting antibodies , including <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	69	1	response
Because mutations in the KRAS gene result in activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway , only metastatic colorectal cancer patients with wild-type KRAS tumors qualify for anti-EGFR targeted therapies with cetuximab or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . Also , a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor ( PLX4032 ) demonstrated antitumor activity in tumors with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and confirmed that V600E BRAF is a valid therapeutic target in human cancer [ ] .	36	60	resistance or non-response
Moreover , the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the BRAF gene is more and more frequently taken into consideration before patient targeted therapy qualification , because wild-type BRAF is required for a response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or cetuximab [ , ] .	35	6	resistance or non-response
A somatic mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 15 of BRAF has been identified in multiple human cancers with a mutation rate of 66 % in malignant melanomas [ ] and at lower frequency in other human carcinomas .

Recently , it was demonstrated that wildtype BRAF is required for the response of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .

The KRAS status is the first molecular marker to predict the response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in metastatic CRC ( mCRC ) patients , and it needs to be determined before deciding in favor of treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies . Previous retrospective studies suggested that mt-BRAF was a marker of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and that the patients with mt-BRAF had significantly shorter PFS and OS than the patients with wt-BRAF tumours . The mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes have been reported to be mutually exclusive. , In the retrospective analysis by Fariña- Sarasqueta et al. , it was also shown that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was an independent prognostic factor for the survival of patients with colon cancer in stages II and III , while the KRAS mutations did not have any effect on the overall survival of these patients .	18	108 109	resistance or non-response
However , acquired resistance to imatinib can occur because of point mutations in the ATP binding site ( e.g. , T674I and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ - ] . T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα is a “gatekeeper” mutation : substitution of the gatekeeper threonine ( T674 ) with a bulky amino acid ( I ) blocks access by imatinib and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , such as nilotinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , to a hydrophobic pocket inside the ATP binding site [ ] .	67 68	22	sensitivity
Other amino acid substitutions observed include G1269A , G1202R , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitutions , as well as a 1151 threonine insertion .

From docking analysis of ALK with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , it is well revealed that both the mutations perturbed the binding pocket quite significantly .

Lung cancers with mutations that activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) , including exon 19 deletions and the exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation , respond to the reversible EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) gefitinib and erlotinib [ ] .

To determine whether the jgIs6 transgenic strain expressing the chimeric LET-23 : : hEGFR-TK [ <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ] protein could be used in a large-scale screen for human EGFR-TK inhibitors , we tested the effects of the drugs gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	39	15	sensitivity
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> , another EGFR-TKI anti-cancer drug , produced similar inhibitory effects to gefitinib ( ) . We tried to compare the expression level of two chimeric proteins from jgIs6 and jgIs25 , but we were unable to quantify the chimeric protein .

Analogous to our findings with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance , at least in vitro crizotinib resistance in ALK-translocation positive lung cancer models also appears to be mediated by an EMT transition accompanied by AXL overexpression . However , in this model AXL inhibition could not overcome resistance to crizotinib but cellular migration and invasion were both reduced [ ] .

Further corroborating data suggesting the importance of AXL as a resistance marker came from a recent study [ ] that identified a 76 gene expression signature of EMT that can classify NSCLCs either as epithelial or mesenchymal .

Therapy of NSCLC with first generation small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors , gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , is severely limited by two main factors : first , the poor sensitivity to TKIs of tumor cells expressing wild type forms of the receptor [ - ] ; second the emergence of drug resistance in virtually all tumors bearing EGFR mutations initially sensitive for the presence of either exon 19 deletions or exon 21 mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ - , ] .	14	72	sensitivity
To assess the effect of anti-ErbB3 monoclonals as sensitizers to gefitinib , we focused on MPEDCC Pe e/10 , which has high expression of ErbB3/ high resistance to the drug ( IC50=9,3 μM ) and PC9ZD resistant cell line which contains the Del exon and harbors <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( IC50 = 14,4 μM ) .

Resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib has been linked to six resistance mutations , . Analysis of sequences where the kinase domain is homologous to that of EGFR reveals that in 4 of the 6 resistance missense mutations , the same amino acid variation is observed in other sequences of related proteins ( and ) . These four resistance mutations are S768I , V769L , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( on exon 20 ) , and T854A ( on exon21 ) , whereas the two resistance mutations that can not be observed as SNVs in the MSA ( L747S and D761Y ) are located on exon 19 .	2	65	resistance or non-response

In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene are targeted by recently introduced small molecule inhibitors , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib .

More recently , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , considered as a pan-BCR-ABL1 inhibitor , was shown to be active against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants [ ] .	3	17	response
For that purpose , we developed a niche based cell mutagenesis assay using UT-7 cells expressing native or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated BCR-ABL1 ( as CML models ) and the murine stromal cell line MS-5 ( as a niche model ) . This cell line creates a surrogate microenvironmental niche that can promote the expansion or differentiation of human HSCs in vitro . Using this screening protocol , four TKIs ( imatinib , nilotinib , dasatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) were tested .	75	18	response
The present strategy highlighted a potential role of the stromal niche in the acquired resistance of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants towards <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	19	16	response
Our assay was based on human UT-7 cell lines ( expressing non mutated or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated BCR-ABL1 ) , mutagenized with ENU ( N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ) and cultured with or without murine MS-5 stromal cells in the presence of imatinib , dasatinib , nilotinib , or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ) .	45	14	response
As expected , only <ANNO_TYPE_drug> caused cell death on 86 % of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated BCR-ABL1 expressing cells ( UT-7-315 ) .	4	12	response
The constant detection of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> MS-5 screening strengthened this hypothesis ( Table , exp. 5 ) .	8	4	response
Mutation profiles with UT-7-315 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> selection displayed interesting data . As expected , all resistant clones carried the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution .	5	19	response
Conversely , in the presence of MS-5 cells , resistant clones mainly harbored the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation alone . Consequently , the mutation profiles appeared different according to MS-5 condition . Finally , resistant UT-7-11 cells selected by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in MS-5 cocultures carried the gatekeeper substitution alone in most cases , whereas no outgrowth was observed without MS-5 ( Fig. ) .	37	14	response
To examine the role of the MS-5 niche , we first analyzed by array-CGH ( 1 ) two imatinib-resistant UT-7-11 clones harboring the E255K mutation compared with UT-7-11 control that did not undergo ENU mutagenesis , and ( 2 ) two <ANNO_TYPE_drug> UT-7-315 clones with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation alone compared with non mutagenized UT-7-315 control ( Fig. ) .	41	46	response
Potential MS-5 effects were analyzed in ( 1 ) two imatinib-resistant UT-7-11 clones harboring the E255K mutation compared with non mutagenized UT-7-11 control and in ( 2 ) two <ANNO_TYPE_drug> UT-7-315 clones harboring the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation alone compared with non mutagenized UT-7-315 control .	29	34	response
In this case , it is uncertain whether or not the MS-5 feeder effects selection of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants . Concerning <ANNO_TYPE_drug> assays on UT-7-315 cell line , a sizable increase in the percentage of resistant clones was observed in the presence of MS-5 stromal cells ( two independent experiments ) .	20	16	response
Another exciting result was the presence of a majority ( 78 % ) of compound mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> + other mutation ) in the absence of MS-5 , and the detection of the T315I mutation alone in most of the resistant clones ( 87.5 % ) recovered from MS-5 condition . According to these results , we can formulate two hypotheses for T315I-resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	64	17	response
According to these results , we can formulate two hypotheses for T315I-resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . First , in the absence of the stromal niche , a compound mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> + another mutation ) could be necessary to induce a complete resistance .	13	29	response
First , in the absence of the stromal niche , a compound mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> + another mutation ) could be necessary to induce a complete resistance . Indeed , cell based screenings have demonstrated that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was potent on single point mutations but less effective on several compound mutations [ ] .	36	14	response
Second , in the presence of the MS-5 microenvironment , UT-7 cells harboring the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation alone could survive <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	19	14	response
In this model , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and stromal niche could jointly play a crucial role in the acquisition of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance .	19	4	response
However , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has been shown to be active against BCR-ABL1 mutants ( in particular the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant ) in vitro as well as in vivo [ , ] .	2	16	response
Altered BCR-ABL1 signaling potentially due to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , associated with a stroma mediated influence on these particular signaling pathways , could represent an explanation for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> escape .	27	7	response
Based on IC50 values , it is noticeable that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> show an intermediate resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	15	9	response
Overall , these data suggest that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants , supported by a stromal niche , could survive <ANNO_TYPE_drug> through interactions mediated by direct contact or soluble factors .	17	6	response
In the absence of MS-5 niche , compound mutations appeared to be the major way to escape <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy , especially via the occurrence of p-loop mutations in addition to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	17	30	response
In the presence of the niche , resistance appeared due to the close association of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants and stromal cells , suggesting a cross-talk between the two components . Overall , we conclude that stromal niche could play a crucial role in conferring resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , by providing survival signals and favoring genetic instability , which is likely to lead to the occurrence of novel mutations .	45	15	response
UT-7 cells harboring the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BCR-ABL1 ( UT-7-315 ) were generated by lipofectamine transfection of a MIGR-BCR-ABL1-T315I plasmid . Drugs and reagents TKIs ( imatinib , nilotinib , dasatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) used in this study were purchased from Selleck Chemicals ( Houston , Texas ) and stored at -20 °C as 1mM stock solutions in DMSO .	30	4	response
Moreover , to investigate the PPP2R5C siRNA effects in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CML cells , we selected two pairs of CML cell lines , including the imatinib-sensitive cell lines K562 and 32D-Bcr-Abl WT and the imatinib-resistant cell lines <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , which lacks an Abl mutation , and 32D-Bcr-Abl T315I , which has an T315I Abl mutation , to compare the different changes induced by PPP2R5C siRNA .	9	36	None

To investigate the effects of AZD0530 on Bcr-Abl harbouring mutations conferring <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Y253F , E255K and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutants were treated with the dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor AZD0530 , and proliferation was assessed comparing them with the Ba/F3 infected p185Bcr-Abl cells treated in a similar manner ( Figure ) .	11	17	None
Other options include bumping up the dose of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , or the use of an agent undergoing clinical trials . The choice of the second-line therapy is also dictated by whether the patient has a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or not – ponatinib being the most promising agent in such a case .	8	40	None
The importance of perfect adherence to TKI therapy should be reinforced to all patients with CML at initiation of therapy and rechecked before the patient is labeled as having “suboptimal response” or treatment failure. [ ] Also , it would be preferable to back this up by checking serum levels <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in such cases . Issue 8 : Mutation analysis When considering a change in therapy , it is important to consider a BCR-ABL kinase domain mutational analysis.

The L747S mutation lies at the start of the β3 strand and the α-C-helix [ ] and has analogous residues in BCR-ABL ( L237M ) and ERBB2 ( L755S or P ) that have been identified in TKI resistant disease [ ] . The occurrence of these secondary mutations spurred development of second and third generation irreversible TKIs which bind covalently to the cysteinyl-797 residue in the pocket of the EGFR-kinase domain and overcome resistance driven by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] .	27 28	111	None

At low ( 5 nm ) and medium ( 10–25 nm ) concentrations of dasatinib , certain mutations arose ( F317C , F317V <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) that did not also confer resistance <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or nilotinib , suggesting that dasatinib could be used as first-line therapy , with imatinib or nilotinib used later if necessary .	32 33	23 24	None
In addition , a complete molecular response ( defined as undetectable BCR-ABL , with a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction sensitivity of ≥5 logs ) was reported for 49 % and 61 % of imatinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> patients with complete cytogenetic response , respectively . Hematological and cytogenetic responses were examined in a subgroup of patients with known BCR-ABL mutations at the study baseline ( n = 115 ) . Remarkably , similar responses were observed across all BCR-ABL mutations when compared with wild-type BCR-ABL , with the exception of the highly resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	35 36	93	None
These results were recently confirmed in a larger Phase II study including 449 mostly heavily pretreated chronic phase , accelerated phase , and blast crisis CML patients , as well as patients with Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia with and without the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . A decreased incidence of progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis has been reported for bosutinib , dasatinib , and nilotinib when compared with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in upfront therapy , even though these differences have only been reported to be statistically significant in the case of nilotinib to date .	69	42	None
On the other hand , the rate of major molecular response was significantly higher , and complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response were achieved more rapidly with bosutinib than with imatinib , suggesting that if early treatment failures can be reduced in the future , patients on bosutinib may achieve both complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response rates that are superior to those of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . In patients with omniresistant mutations , allogeneic stem cell transplantation and interferon are currently the only approved treatment options with a potential life prolongation for patients . This is of particular importance because <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is predicted to have an increased clinical impact in the future because of the growing selection pressure on resistant leukemic subclones under second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment .	66	101	None
However , the comparison between the results of FISH using peripheral blood leukocytes and the cytogenetics of the bone marrow may not establish an appropriate correlation in the measurement of CML activity during <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment ( ) ( B ) . The existence or occurrence of mutations in CML patients under TKI treatment , when identified , enables an estimation of the prognosis and guides treatment . Some mutations can be identified by direct sequencing during the follow-up of patients including : T315T , T315I , F317L , V339L , M351T , E355G , Y253F and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ; these are associated with different responses to available inhibitors .	33	96	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations occur more often in patients treated with dasatinib . Recommendation : BCR-ABL mutations should be investigated in CML patients resistant to TKIs ( suboptimal response or failure ) regardless of the stage , because their presence predicts the greater risk of resistance and shorter survival . Does the diagnosis of mutations guide the choice of treatment in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> patients ?	59	0	None
In contrast to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mesylate , mutations recovered in the presence of 50 nM nilotinib were limited to L248V , G250E , Y253H , E255K ( p-loop ) , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , F359C , L384M and L387F .	3	29	None

At 500 nM , only <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , E255V and T315I were detected , in line with their reported level of resistance in cell proliferation assays . At concentrations of at least 2000 nM , only T315I was recovered . The fact that only 1 novel mutation occurred at a low concentration and the lack of novel , previously undescribed mutations at intermediate inhibitor concentrations ( 500 nM ) suggests that the structural modifications of nilotinib compared with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> do not generate clinically relevant novel vulnerable sites .	77	5	None

For example , three BCR-ABL mutations ( T315I , Y253H , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) have a predicted role in abrogating binding of imatinib to BCR-ABL in resistant patients . The second-generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , binds to BCR-ABL with less stringent conformational requirements and was shown to be effective in inhibition of imatinib-resistant mutants .	35	12	None

In the case of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , the median PFS in the PROFILE studies was 7.7 months .

To assess the in vivo relevance of our in vitro results , vemurafenib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> combination was tested for its ability to inhibit the growth of M21 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice .	14	28	None
A , E. M21 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells were each implanted subcutaneously in 20 SCID mice . When tumors became palpable , mice were randomly divided into 4 groups ( 5 mice/group ) .

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> as well as GDC-0449 ( GDC ) ( B ) inhibited cell proliferation individually and the combination was significantly more effective . TGF-β1 induced EMT of NSCLC cells involves modulation of Cancer Stem Cells ( CSCs ) and miRNAs In order to fully understand the mechanism ( s ) of drug resistance that accompany induction of EMT in NSCLC cells , we investigated CSC markers ( Sox2 , Nanog and EpCAM ) and the expression levels of several EMT related miRNAs in parental A549 vs. mesenchymal <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells .	0	87	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells were more resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and cisplatin , compared to parental A549 cells , and A549M cells treated with GDC-0449 showed reduced cell proliferation ( Table ) , as evidenced by lower IC50 of both the drugs in the cells pre treated with GDC-0449 .	6	0	None

Also like that observed for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in this study , estradiol treatment was able to markedly increase PRL production and cell proliferation in cells expressing the D2S receptor , but produced a minimal effect in cell producing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptors .	5	37	None
Furthermore , the data showing increased Gs levels following Gi3 blockade in ethanol-responsive D2S cells and not in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells identify the critical importance of the Gi3 and Gs inhibitory interaction in the regulation of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> action on lactotropic cells .	35	18	None
Furthermore , by increasing the production of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> may decouple the D2 receptor influence on Gi3 and Gs interaction and thereby reduce the dopaminergic inhibitory control over PRL production and cell proliferation .	9	7	None

By contrast , we showed that other EGFR mutants are oncogenic without the requirement for dimerization , including the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> exon 20 insertion mutant and the T790M mutant [ ] . Furthermore , we found that dimerization dependent L858R mutant shows a dramatic response to cetuximab , whereas tumors driven by dimerization independent mutants such as T790M are resistant to the antibody , suggesting that there is a close correlation between dimerization dependency of lung cancer derived oncogenic mutant EGFR and pharmacological effects of cetuximab [ ] . Given that colon cancer derived G719S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants are sensitive to cetuximab , we sought to examine whether oncogenic potential of these mutants are dependent on the asymmetric dimerization like lung cancer derived L858R mutant .	19	95	None
However , a higher concentration of E2 ( 1.0 nM ) prolonged APD ( 168.89 ms ) ( Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> – left panel ) .

Since silencing hMSH5 expression or replacing hMSH5 with hMSH5 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( a phosphorylation-resistant mutant ) sensitizes cells to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , it appears that the induction of hMSH5 expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of hMSH5 are critical early events for repair of cisplatin induced DNA lesions [ ] .	18	9	None
Previous studies using colorectal cancer ( HT29 ) , breast cancer ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and colon cancer ( H630 ) cells , in accordance with our own , have found that acquired chemo-resistance can reduce growth rate , . Reduced cell proliferation due to the presence of chromosomal instability , which is associated with multi-drug resistance , has recently been demonstrated in colorectal cancer cells . Thus the increased ability of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> variants to resist cell death under anoikis conditions in our study can not be attributed to a simple increased rate of proliferation .	71	12	None

Also , centrosome amplification induced by a transient G1/S arrest because of the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , generated aneuploidy both in human and MEFs with pRb dysfunction [ ] .

In the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant , the mutation from Tyr67 to Arg67 may produce not only a distal arginine ( although its structure is not available ) , but also a room for substrate coordination ( because Fe-S bond is broken in the Y67R variant ) . Our current NMR structure of the Y67H variant ( determined at pH 7.0 ) suggests that the sixth ligation bond Fe-S is attenuated due to the disruption of hydrogen bond between Met80 and Tyr67 existed in the native cyt c . The distance between Nε atom of His67 and heme ferric iron is measured as 5.48 Å in the Y67H variant , very close to the distances of 5.84 Å and 5.55 Å between Nε2 atom of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and heme iron ion in horseradish peroxidase ( HRP , pdb codes 1H5A ) and cytochrome c peroxidase ( CcP , pdb codes 2CYP ) , , respectively .	124 125	2	None
Tyr67 is located at the distal position of heme pocket of the yeast iso-1 cyt c , thus , we thought that the mutations from Tyr67 to His67 , or to Arg67 , might induce a distal <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or a distal arginine , which could enhance peroxidation activity of cyt c . Within our anticipation , in guaiacol peroxidation at pH 7.0 and 16°C , compared to the wild type cyt c , the catalytic efficiency kcat/Km for the Y67H variant ( where kcat/Km = 89.38 M−1s−1 , Km = 0.0096 M , kcat = 0.858 s−1 ) is increased by about 16 folds ( for wild-type cyt c , the value kcat/Km is 5.12 M−1s−1 , Km = 0.0127 M , kcat = 0.065 s−1 ) , while kcat/Km <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> Y67R variant is raised by about 8 times ( for the Y67R variant , the value kcat/Km is 37.47 M−1s−1 , Km = 0.0162 M , kcat = 0.607 s−1 ) - .	37	130 131	None

For tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) [ ] , mutations within the ATP pocket of the kinase domain may affect the interaction of the drug with its target : for example , the single amino acid mutation tyrosine/methionine ( T790M ) in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR mediates secondary resistance to the EGFR TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ , ] . The T790M mutation in EGFR is structurally analogous to drug resistance mutations in other kinases such as BCR-ABL ( T315I ) , c-KIT ( T670I ) and platelet derived growth factor receptor-α ( PDGFRα ) <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] .	57	107 108	None
In addition , they showed that two dominant activating mutations in the PI3K catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PI3K-CA ) , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and H1047R , which are prevalent in breast cancer , also confer resistance to lapatinib [ ] . Conversely , Li et al. infected cells with lentiviruses expressing either wild-type kinases ( Src , Fyn Lyn , EGFR and others ) or kinase alleles with gatekeeper mutations . Through this approach , they showed that Src Family Kinases (SFKs) , as well as EGFR , are relevant targets for the Src inhibitor dasatinib and that acquired T790M mutations render cells resistant not only to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib , but also to dasatinib [ ] .	106	21	None

It has also been shown that exposure of glioblastoma cells to glucocorticoids induces partial resistance to anti-cancer agents such as cisplatinum , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , vincristine , cytarabine , adriamycin , and teniposide [ - ] . DXM appears to interfere with p53 dependent pathways of drug toxicity since the glioblastoma cell lines ( LN-229 and U87MG ) with wild-type p53 status were protected from drug toxicity by DXM to a greater extent than the cell lines ( LN-18 , LN-308 , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) with mutant p53 [ - ] .	22	82	None

R1 substitutions to residues other than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> result in a hyperpolarization induced inward current carried by alkali metal cations rather than protons ( Tombola et al. , ) indicating that this mutation creates a short-circuit connection of intracellular and extracellular compartments in the canaliculus . This current varies with the identity of the substituted residue : R1S &gt ; R1C &gt ; R1V ∼ R1A , has the selectivity Cs+ & gt; K+ & gt ; Li+ , and is not affected by alpha pore blockers . Shaker mutants <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and R3H conduct protons at potentials corresponding to the voltage dependent movement of S4 charges , as the current is maximal at potentials close to midpoint of the QON-voltage relation ( Starace et al. , ; Starace and Bezanilla , ) .	6	84	None
To confirm that the high affinity binding of MPL6 was due to multivalency , we measured the binding affinities of the individual components and MPL variants that had either <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and R8A mutations to abolish meditope binding , or Y51W and L55H mutations to weaken protein L binding to memAb <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	50	29	None

These results suggest that both Ser346 and Lys347 represent additional factors that determine the NADP+ specificity of human c-NADP-ME . Indeed , both double-mutant enzymes , S346K/K362Q and K347Y/K362Q , displayed <ANNO_TYPE_drug> specificity , as both of them exhibited similar values for Km , NADP and Km , NAD and for kcat , NADP and kcat , NAD .	68	23	None

Both D1R and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family ( D2R in particular ) have been implicated in the mechanisms of drug dependence and abuse . Disruption of D1R gene expression or administration of D1R antagonist attenuates or prevents <ANNO_TYPE_drug> seeking behavior .	36	4	None
Using this screening protocol , four TKIs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , nilotinib , dasatinib and ponatinib ) were tested . TKI-resistant UT-7 clones , appearing in the presence or in the absence of the niche , were analyzed for BCR-ABL1-kinase mutations , and some of them were further analyzed by array-comparative genomic hybridization ( array-CGH ) . The present strategy highlighted a potential role of the stromal niche in the acquired resistance of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants towards ponatinib .	8	72	None
Our assay was based on human UT-7 cell lines ( expressing non mutated or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated BCR-ABL1 ) , mutagenized with ENU ( N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ) and cultured with or without murine MS-5 stromal cells in the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib , nilotinib , or ponatinib ( ) .	38	14	None

The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation occurs at a conserved threonine residue located near the kinase active site that is found in many kinases and is often referred to as the “gatekeeper mutation” . Gatekeeper mutations have been found in many kinase-driven tumors that develop resistance to kinase inhibitor treatment ( e.g. , CML patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> that develop the T315I resistance mutation in BCR-ABL ) .	54	1	None
Gatekeeper mutations have been found in many kinase-driven tumors that develop resistance to kinase inhibitor treatment ( e.g. , CML patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> that develop the T315I resistance mutation in BCR-ABL ) .

Studies comparing dasatinib , nilotinib and bosutinib to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML are underway.– , If durable cytogenetic response rates are significantly improved with the use of these medications in the front line setting , it is possible that a smaller percentage of patients will ultimately develop treatment resistance . Lastly , new small molecule non-ATP-competitive inhibitors designed to address the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation are under development .	8	64	None
The only mutation found to be unaffected by nilotinib usage is , as in the case of dasatinib , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Based on phase 1 studies , a dose of 400 mg twice daily was thought to be optimal for phase 2 evaluation . In the most recent update of a phase 2 trial of nilotinib in 320 patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> failure in chronic phase who had received nilotinib for at least 6 months , the CHR rate , MCyR rate and CCyR rate were 76 % , 56 % and 40 % respectively .	62	20	None
Therefore , unless a randomized study is performed ( an unlikely prospect ) , no data support the preferential use of either TKI for patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CML . An exception may be for certain mutations which have better in vitro sensitivity to one agent or another such as P-loop and F359I/V mutations , which are more sensitive to dasatinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations which are more sensitive to nilotinib .	26	62	None

Structural analysis of the PrfA* <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant has indicated that a new hydrogen bond is formed between K130 and Q146 as a result of the G145S mutation . K130 and Q146 may similarly interact as result of the conformational changes induced by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding , and the substitution of the lysine 130 to glutamine would be anticipated to eliminate this interaction and may thus impact PrfA activation .	42	5	None
The double substitution mutant did not exacerbate the effects observed for the single substitution mutants , but rather appeared to restore a portion of activity in comparison to prfA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> single substitution strains . It is possible that the charge neutralization of both lysine residues may potentially mimic charge neutralization that occurs as a result of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding .	56	29	None
The prfA* Y63C mutation results in a highly activated form of PrfA with target gene expression levels similar to those observed for prfA constitutive activation mutations , such as prfA* G145S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , .

Increased stability of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1α and its endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) accumulation were found in the brain of these mutant mice , which appeared to be a cause of the failure of collagen deposition along blood vessels in the CNS of IDH1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) mutants [ ] . Similar to TETs , HIF1α also belongs to the dioxygenase family and plays a key role in the cellular response to hypoxia [ ] . The stability of HIF1α is regulated by the prolyl hydroxylase domain containing protein ( PHDs ) , which in principle requires αKG as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and is also a potential target influenced by 2-HG competition .	100 101	45 46	None

Reduced thermal stability of the T15A and E232K variations was not enough to abolish their activity , while the N158D and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variations result in inactive enzymes and severe form of the disease despite normal protein stability . It is noted that the affected stability and the opening of the structure ( like e.g. domain movements or secondary structure fluctuations ) are not necessarily connected .

It is possible that the availability of NADPH as a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in drug activation may well be influenced by prevailing metabolic conditions , forming a coupled interactive system and therefore constituting a control point in drug activation . The data obtained based on the methodology used by Elwell and colleagues ( Elwell et al , 1997 ) indicated that SR4317 formation rate was essentially identical between the A549wt and A549c50 cells despite the very dramatic differences in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> activity .	10	77	None
The reduced rate constant for nucleotide incorporation and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect observed for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> derivative relative to wt enzyme provide additional support for Lys359 being employed as a general acid .

For that purpose , we developed a niche based cell mutagenesis assay using UT-7 cells expressing native or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated BCR-ABL1 ( as CML models ) and the murine stromal cell line MS-5 ( as a niche model ) . This cell line creates a surrogate microenvironmental niche that can promote the expansion or differentiation of human HSCs in vitro . Using this screening protocol , four TKIs ( imatinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib and ponatinib ) were tested .	71	18	None
Just like <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , it is more potent than imatinib but is less selective than either . Second-generation TKIs are currently used in clinical practice and are efficient on most of the mutants , with the exception of the threonine-isoleucine substitution at position 315 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] .	2	45	None
Using this screening protocol , four TKIs ( imatinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib and ponatinib ) were tested .

In other cases , treatment has to be switched to dasatinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Both drugs are registered and approved for treatment of imatinib-resistant CML .

To determine if ATRA co-treatment may work for inhibiting CML acquired resistance by other BCR-ABL mutations or non-mutation mediated resistance , we treated four CML resistance cell lines that were originated from KCL-22 cells but developed resistance differently : L1 , L7 and Ag11 lines through E255K , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T315I BCR-ABL mutations respectively , and Ag3 line through non-BCR-ABL mutation mediated mechanism .	2	57	None
To construct TKI-resistant K562 sublines , the K562 cell lines were exposed to three conditions , 50 and 250 n of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and 800 n of imatinib . The culture conditions and related experimental protocols are described elsewhere . To rule out the mutation based resistance acquisition , the BCR-ABL loci of three resistant K562 sublines were screened by nucleotide sequencing , and the absence of major clinically relevant point mutations including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was confirmed for all three sublines .	21	72	None
To overcome the acquired resistance , second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib and INNO-406 ) have been developed and are effective against all but the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation which accounts for approximately 20 % of acquired resistance cases [ - ] .	14	30	None
Studies of newer TKIs , such as dasatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( which can act through signaling pathways other than c-KIT and PDGF-R ) , are currently ongoing , as are studies with IPI-504 , a heatshock protein 90 inhibitor . Work in GIST cell lines suggests that treatment with dasatinib or IPI-504 may provide a therapeutic alternative for GIST patients whose tumors carry the imatinib-resistant PDGR-F ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) mutant isoform .	9	67	None
To overcome the acquired resistance to IM , new tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib and INNO-406 have been developed and are effective against most mutations but not the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ - ] .	17	34	None
The activity of DAS is maintained despite the presence of mutations that confer resistance to IM with the exception of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , and to a large degree , mutations affecting the residue 317 ( F317L , F317V ) . The V299L mutation , although rarely acquired on IM , is often detected at the time of DAS failure . For those patients with the 299 and 317 mutations detected at the time of initiation of DAS , other agents such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , bosutinib ( SKI606 ;	83	21	None
One molecule , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( AMN107 ) , is able to inhibit kinase activity of wild-type F/P [ ] . Two other compounds , PKC412 which is structurally unrelated to imatinib [ ] , and sorafenib [ ] , are able to inhibit kinase activity of both wild-type F/P and its imatinib -resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant form .	3	53	None
The patient that remained on study for 12 cycles had a biopsy prior to study entry that demonstrated a primary KIT exon 11 ( alteration beginning at K558 ) with a secondary exon 17 mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . The benefit of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for patients with exon 11 and 17 mutations is intriguing but appears to be dependent on the specific secondary mutation in exon 17 .	42	36	None
Although imatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> disrupt the hydrophobic spine , the fact that they fail to show any activity against the gatekeeper mutant may be due to the requirement of higher free energy to destabilize the active state imposed by their physical interactions with the activation loop . DISCUSSION Substitution of the gatekeeper threonine residue by isoleucine in the BCR-ABL oncoprotein ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) was the first resistance mutation noted in imatinib treated patients , and mutation in the homologous residue has emerged as a common mechanism of resistance for numerous kinases .	3	61	None
Both Aurora kinases A and B have been linked to tumorigenesis and previous publication highlight the importance of Aurora A inhibition : Kelly et al. showed preclinical activity of Alisertib , a selective Aurora A inhibitor as a single agent or in combination with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in CML cells bearing wild-type or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BCR-ABL .	44	51	None
Specific inhibition of BCR-ABL by first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) targeting the kinase domain of BCR-ABL , such as imatinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and dasatinib , has revolutionized the treatment of Ph+ malignancies , . Despite the potent effects of second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors , a subset of patients still harbor certain BCR-ABL mutations , such as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , which is refractory to first- and second-generation TKIs in vitro and in vivo , , .	25	60	None
Treatment with second generation BCR-ABL inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and dasatinib also resulted in relapse and acquisition of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in KCL-22 cells , but their combination with tenovin-6 or sirtinol blocked the recurrence ( and not shown ) .	6	16	None
Two phase III trials compared afatinib to a platinum-doublet in patients with advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC , and a combined analysis for overall survival was presented at ASCO , as well as subset analyses based on EGFR mutation subtype ( exon 19 deletion and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation ) [ ] . In subgroup analysis based on EGFR mutation type the benefit appeared to be limited to patients with exon 19 mutations . When cross-over to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was examined , 75 % of patients who received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and pemetrexed received an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and 56 % of patients who received cisplatin and gemcitabine received an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor .	91	46	None
