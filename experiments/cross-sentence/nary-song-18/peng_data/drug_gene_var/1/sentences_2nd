In contrast to previous retrospective analyses ( ; ) , patients with exon 19 deletions were equally responsive compared to those with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in this study .

In <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation positive patients treated by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , TTP ( 9.4 months ) of after the gefitinib treatment and MST ( 19.1 months ) after the initial treatment were longer than in patients treated with the regimens using platinum doublet .	56	50	22	sensitivity

All such mutations result in conformational changes that lead to increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors .

Earlier studies have suggested an active involvement of EMT in resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKIs , and accordingly , E-cadherin expression has been reported to operate as a biomarker capable of predicting the clinical efficacy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . However , it should be noted that these studies were largely based on NSCLC cells expressing wild-type EGFR ; therefore , these studies did not mimic clinical usage of EGFR TKIs because EGFR wild-type NSCLC cells are intrinsically resistant to EGFR TKIs . In this scenario , it might appear reasonable to suggest that in addition to the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , immunohistochemical and/or microarray based transcriptional profiling studies dedicated to specific alterations of EMT drivers ( e.g. , SLUG ) and/or effectors ( e.g. , vimentin ) may be helpful in monitoring for erlotinib responders and non-responders based on the loss of biomarkers associated with epithelial status and gain of biomarkers associated with mesenchymal status .	35	12	98	resistance or non-response

Neratinib is an oral , irreversible inhibitor of both <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and HER2 ; in preclinical studies conducted on cell lines with both an activating EGFR mutation and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , neratinib was more effective at suppressing cell proliferation than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	39	9	28	resistance or non-response

In 2004 , EGFR gene mutations were firstly identified : classical activating EGFR mutations are localized in exon 19 , mainly consisting of an in-frame deletion ( 45-50 % ) , and in exon 21 , consisting of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation ( 40-45 % ) , even if there are less common mutations localized in other exons [ – ] . Since their identification , it was clear that EGFR mutations , more frequently observed in never smokers , adenocarcinoma histology , women and Asiatic patients , outline a distinct subgroup of NSCLC . During the last years , six phase III trials ( Table ) established that patients harboring activating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations benefit more from a first line treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , such as erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , than from standard chemotherapy , at least in terms of response rate ( RR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) and quality of life [ – ] .	135	112	39	sensitivity

Patients with exon 19 harboring deletions were found to have longer survival following treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib compared with those having <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in NSCLC [ , ] ; however , Marks et al. reported no difference in survival between exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations in the absence of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> targeted therapy [ ] .	15	51	22	sensitivity
In vitro studies showed that exon 19 deleted mutants and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant receptors appear to be more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition as compared to wild type receptors [ , ] . This could explain why NSCLC patients harboring such mutations respond better to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) than patients without such mutations .	19	43	10	sensitivity

The patients who had a diagnosis of advanced NSCLC with stage III–IV and the patients harboring activating EGFR mutations ( either exon 19 deletion <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 ) . All patients received <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKIs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib ) for monotherapy , first line or otherwise .	37	34	24 25	sensitivity
The IC50 values corresponded with the degrees of inhibition of phosphorylation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and key components of downstream signaling cascades ( i.e. , ERK and AKT ) , as seen by immunoblotting lysates derived from the lines treated with various concentrations of drug with phospho-specific antibodies ( ) . H1975 cells were insensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> due to the drug-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] .	54	12	59	resistance or non-response
Here , tumor bearing transgenic animals ( as determined by magnetic resonance imaging ) were treated with a single dose of vehicle ( n = 5 ) or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 50 mg/kg ; n = 5 ) intraperitoneally and humanely killed 13 h later . Lungs from all <ANNO_TYPE_gene> animals expressed the induced oncoprotein , as measured by immunoreactivity of lysates with antisera against the specific <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR [ ] ( A ) .	28	48	66	sensitivity

In Vivo Correlation of BIM/Bim Expression and Mutant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Activity ( A and B ) Lung tumor bearing mice that express a tetracycline-inducible <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant ( EGFRL858R ) ( A ) or an exon 19 deletion mutant ( EGFRΔL747–S752 ) ( B ) were treated with a single dose of either vehicle control or 50 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> intraperitoneally .	55 56	8	23	sensitivity
Specifically , we examined the relationship between levels of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and Bim in tumors induced in transgenic mice that conditionally express mutant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFRs in lung epithelial cells under the control of tetracycline regulation [ ] . We previously showed that treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> eliminated disease within lung tumor bearing animals [ ] .	43	9	22	sensitivity
Analogously , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , in conjunction with the drug-responsive del L747–E749 ; A750P <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutant , prevents inhibition of p-EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( C ) .	22 23	15	3	resistance or non-response

Such mutations rarely , if ever , accompany <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations and are associated with primary resistance to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . To evaluate the possibility that secondary KRAS mutations confer acquired resistance to these drugs , we performed mutational profiling of KRAS2 exon 2 from tumor specimens from patients 1 to 3 , as well as the three additional patients lacking evidence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	19	8	66	resistance or non-response
Collectively , these findings imply that the exon 20 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was present on the same allele as the exon 21 L858R mutation , and that a subclone of cells harboring these mutations emerged during drug treatment . In patient 2 , the tumor-rich sample obtained prior to treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> did not contain any additional mutations in the exons encoding the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase domain ( B , upper panels ; ) .	50	62	9	resistance or non-response
To determine whether the 2369 C→T mutation was a previously overlooked <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation found in NSCLCs , we re-reviewed exon 20 sequence tracings derived from analysis of 96 fresh-frozen resected tumors [ ] and 59 paraffin embedded tumors [ ] , all of which were removed from patients prior to treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor . We did not detect any evidence of the T790M mutation in these 155 tumors ( data not shown ; see ) . Collectively , our results suggest that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is associated with lesions that progress while on gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	99	11	87	resistance or non-response

Specific mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> are associated with sensitivity to either gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , but mechanisms of acquired resistance have not yet been reported . Based upon analogous studies in other diseases with another kinase inhibitor , imatinib , a single amino acid substitution from threonine to methionine at position 790 in the wild-type EGFR kinase domain was predicted to lead to drug resistance , even before the association of exon 19 and 21 mutations of EGFR with drug responsiveness in NSCLC was reported . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was shown in vitro in the context of wild-type EGFR to confer resistance to gefitinib [ ] and a related quinazoline inhibitor , PD153035 [ ] .	17	8	91	resistance or non-response
The T790M mutation was shown in vitro in the context of wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> to confer resistance to gefitinib [ ] and a related quinazoline inhibitor , PD153035 [ ] .

Since tumor specimens from three additional patients with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not demonstrate the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , this specific lesion does not account for all mechanisms of acquired resistance to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	37	11	19	resistance or non-response

The EGFR T790M mutation , in conjunction with either wild-type EGFR or the drug-sensitive <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutant , prevents inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation ( A ) or p-EGFR ( B ) by gefitinib .	16	28	62	sensitivity

These results suggest that the T790M mutation may impair the ability of gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase activity , even in EGFR mutants ( i.e. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or an exon 19 deletion ) that are clinically associated with drug sensitivity .	14	17	29	sensitivity

We found that the mechanism of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance of HCC827TR3 was neither c-Met amplification nor <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( data not shown ) .	6	18	15	resistance or non-response
On the other hand , erlotinib could not inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_gene> phosphorylation in H1975 cells because the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR causes a conformation change at the ATP binding pocket , thus decreasing the affinity between <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and EGFR .	35	9	16	resistance or non-response

Gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> represent the first generation of small <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) that selectively target the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR , blocking the downstream signaling of the receptor . The EGFR somatic mutations have emerged to be the most relevant predictor of response to these agents. , Thus , several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that the use of EGFR TKIs in patients with advanced treatment-naive NSCLC with EGFR mutations significantly improved the objective response rate ( ORR ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) compared with standard platinum based chemotherapy.– Unfortunately , all responders eventually develop resistance , most commonly because of the emergence of a gatekeeper mutation in the kinase domain , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR mutated NSCLC or amplification of mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor ( c-Met ) .	2	9	122	resistance or non-response

Otherwise , CO-1686 is a novel irreversible mutant-selective inhibitor of EGFR , able to target both the initial activating EGFR mutations as well as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary acquired resistance mutation . To investigate its use as a single agent , CO-1686 is being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> NSCLC patients previously treated with first-line gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( NCT01526928 ) .	59	50	25	resistance or non-response
The most commonly identified mechanism of resistance is an <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , resulting in substitution of a threonine residue with methionine , which abrogates the ability of gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to inhibit EGFR [ , ] .	35	9	15	resistance or non-response

Since the first reports of an association between somatic mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> exons 19 and 21 and response to gefitinib , treatment of NSCLC has changed dramatically [ , ] . It has been shown that exon 19 deletions are more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition than the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , a finding demonstrated by kinetic analysis [ ] and also confirmed in clinical studies [ - ] .	43	11	47	sensitivity
It has been shown that exon 19 deletions are more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibition than the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , a finding demonstrated by kinetic analysis [ ] and also confirmed in clinical studies [ - ] .

The majority of activating mutations are of 3 dominant types , deletions in exon 19 , insertions in exon 20 or a single point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . More recent data have focused on patients with known mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> who initially respond and subsequently become resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	47	38	25	sensitivity
Resistance due to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> can potentially overcome by second generation irreversible EGFR TKIs , which appear to be well tolerated in early clinical studies [ ] . Although did not demonstrated an overall survival benefit , Afatinib , an irreversible <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , Her-2 , and ErbB4 blocker has led to significant PFS in patients who progressed after a 12 week course of Gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> when compared to placebo in a phase 2b/3 trial [ ] .	64	40	3	resistance or non-response

The other EGFR mutations , e.g. , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation on exon 20 , represent less than 10 % of all mutations , and are associated with drug resistance ( ) . Treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation Both the European Society of Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) ( ) and the American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) ( ) recommend first-line treatment with a TKI ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib ) in metastatic NSCLC bearing an activating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation because of higher response rate , longer progression free survival ( PFS ) , and better quality of life when compared with first-line chemotherapy .	72	82	8	resistance or non-response

In pre-clinical studies , neratinib inhibited the growth of NCI-H1975 bronchoalveolar cancer cells harboring both substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 ( L858R ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and cell lines harboring the HER2 mutation [ ] . A phase I study of the advanced stage of solid tumors showed that the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of neratinib was 320 mg once daily [ ] . An open-label , single-agent , phase II study revealed only a 3 % RR in patients with an <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation who had been treated with gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for more than 12 weeks .	95	86	27	resistance or non-response
It was initially proposed based on the crystallographic structure of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase domain . The bulkier methionine residue <ANNO_TYPE_variant> changes the ATP binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain , leading to the blockade of gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	39	11	20	resistance or non-response
Another retrospective study reported a small group ( 14 patients ) of patients that was heavily treated and then re-treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> after a median interval from the discontinuation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> to the second episode of 9.5 months ( 3–36 months ) [ ] . The RR was 36 % ( n = 5 ) , and the disease control rate was 85.7 % ( n = 12 ) . Before beginning the re-treatment , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was detected in 36 % of patients ( five of 14 ) .	21	30	75	resistance or non-response
In the xenograft model of mice , the combination of cetuximab and afatinib can lead to a significant reduction of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> tumor harboring <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , compared to gefitinib plus cetuximab [ ] . A phase II study supported by the above preclinical data was then conducted using the combination of cetuximab and afatinib in NSCLC patients who developed acquired resistance to first-generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> by clinical definition [ , ] .	20	62	23	resistance or non-response
However , it was demonstrated recently that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> increased the affinity of ATP to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase domain ; thus , it decreased the binding of gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , because they are ATP-competitive agents [ ] .	29	15	7	resistance or non-response
In pre-clinical studies , neratinib inhibited the growth of NCI-H1975 bronchoalveolar cancer cells harboring both substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and T790M and cell lines harboring the HER2 mutation [ ] . A phase I study of the advanced stage of solid tumors showed that the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of neratinib was 320 mg once daily [ ] .

At the molecular level , most patients with partial or complete responses to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> harbored specific mutations in the gene that encodes <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , located on chromosome 7p12 [ ] . Exon 19 mutations , characterized by in-frame deletions of amino-acids 747–750 , account for 45 % of mutations , exon 21 mutations , resulting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitutions , account for 40–45 % of mutations , and the remaining 10 % of mutations involve exon 18 and 20 [ - ] .	15	24	57 58	sensitivity
As the theoretical advantage of afatinib versus the first-generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> did not translate into progression-free survival gains , maybe the clinical relevance of possible inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is minimal , at least in the first-line setting , when T790M positive clones are rarely detected . A limitation of our study is the indirect comparison of gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and afatinib with one another , which relies on the quality of variance component estimates .	57	9	26	resistance or non-response
Preclinical studies have shown superior activity of afatinib over first-generation TKIs , mainly due to ( 1 ) irreversible binding , which confers stronger binding affinity and potency , ( 2 ) ability to circumvent first-generation TKI resistance mechanism <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 20 , and ( 3 ) effectiveness against multiple HER-endothelial growth factor receptors . Recently , TKIs have been investigated in eight phase 3 trials as first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activating mutations , in comparison with platinum based chemotherapy doublets : gefitinib trials IPASS , , West Japan , North-East Japan , , and First-SIGNAL ; <ANNO_TYPE_drug> trials OPTIMAL , and EURTAC ; and afatinib trials LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 .	104	77	39	resistance or non-response
One of the proposed mechanisms of resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation on exon 20 .

The patient was first administered <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and maintained a good response for one year , according to the literature data ( 14 months ) ( ) . The patient then presented with a peritoneal progression and a second biopsy was planned to rule out acquired resistant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations .

As in our study , iTARGET and EURTAC reported generally mild to moderate AEs ( rash and diarrhoea ) , although 13 % of patients ( 11 out of 84 ) in EURTAC did experience grade-3/4 rash with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( there were no grade-3/4 rash events with gefitinib reported in our study ) . Mutation subtype analysis results in iTARGET and EURTAC were also similar to our study , with exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> the most common mutation subtypes detected .

The two most common genetic mutations are the in-frame deletion in exon 19 ( E746-A750 ) and the substitution of leucine 858 by arginine in the exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . These two mutations constitute about 90 % of all mutations and are known as the “classical” mutations . These two <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations are strong predictors of the response to small-molecule EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	70	52	29	sensitivity

PNA-LNA PCR clamp analysis of the spinal fluid revealed the same <ANNO_TYPE_gene> deletion mutation ; however , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation could not be detected . Thus , we administered <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to control the central nervous system metastasis .	29	11	18	resistance or non-response
In patients with the non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) , the assessment of mutations in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain may be used as a predictive biomarker . It has been proved that somatic mutations in exons 19 or 21 are related to tumor sensitivity to therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) such as gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A higher median survival rate was observed in the case of exon deletion in exon 19 than in the case of the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 [ ] .	58	17	84	sensitivity
Similarly , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutant could cause resistance to Gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> drugs in the treatment of lung cancer , . Importantly , these mutations can promote oncogenic activation , uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis even in the absence of the selective pressure from the kinase inhibitors . An activating mutation in the activation loop of the EGFR kinase domain , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( also identified as Leu834 in a different numbering of the EGFR sequence ) is among most frequent mutations in lung cancer , amounting to more than 40 % of EGFR mutations in this cancer category – .	10	2	60	sensitivity
Similarly , the gatekeeper mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> causes resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and has been detected in lung cancer patients before drug treatment and in the germ line of a family pedigree with several cases of lung cancer , .	13	7	5	resistance or non-response
Finally , although molecularly targeted therapies ( that is , gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and crizotinib for ALK fusions ) are effective in NSCLC , intrinsic or acquired resistances inevitably lead to recurrence and/or metastatic dissemination . This is the case of MET activation/amplification , , or acquired somatic mutations of EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) or ALK fusions ( G1269A , L1196M and ALK amplification ) . , ,	12	14	54	resistance or non-response
Grommes et al. also reported a study involving treatment of a very small group of patients ( n = 9 ) treated with pulsatile , high-dose <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with CNS metastases and with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation diagnosed outside of CNS metastases . A partial response of CNS metastases was observed in six patients . Corresponding tissue from the CNS metastases was available for four patients with response after tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) -EGFR therapy diagnosed with EGFR mutation matching to those diagnosed outside the CNS metastases ( three <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution and one deletion in exon 19 ) [ ] .	26	32	88	sensitivity
Most of the mutations are in frame deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] . A deletion between codons 746 and 750 accounts for 65–75.5 % of the deletions in exon 19 [ ] . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib are compounds that reversibly inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and have been employed in the treatment of patients with NSCLC .	44	57	19	sensitivity
In spite of recent improvements in NSCLC management , such as the use of targeted therapy including gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which have led to improved progression-free survival and quality of life in NSCLC patients with an activating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation , progression or metastasis because of resistance to targeted therapy remains a major clinical problem . Apart from <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and c-MET amplification , a recent study has reported that Axl kinase is upregulated in humans with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI .	19	38	58	resistance or non-response
In particular , H1975 cells contain a second mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) reported to be linked to gefitinib resistance [ ] , but we found that these cells also responded poorly to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . It has been proposed that mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cause repositioning of several critical residues surrounding the ATP binding cleft of the tyrosine kinase domain ; this repositioning stabilizes the interactions between the ATP binding site and reversible inhibitors such as gefitinib [ , ] .	32	46	10	response 
H1975 cells , which also contain a second mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) linked to gefitinib resistance [ ] , responded poorly to either agent .

Indeed , in non-small cell lung cancers treated with gefitinib or erlotinib , sensitive patients have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in only a few cells , whereas resistant patients exhibit EGFR T790M in the majority of the tumour cells ( ; ) . In conclusion , our results , which deserve a confirmation in larger ( not only retrospective ) studies , revealed that the response to anti-EGFR MoAbs may be influenced by the HER2 gene copy number status ( as detected by FISH ) in KRAS wt mCRC patients . The presence of HER2 gene amplification throughout the tumour ( HER2-all-A patients ) is associated not only with resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab but may also identify patients who could benefit from specific anti-HER2 drugs ( i.e. , trastuzumab ) or from combined <ANNO_TYPE_gene> targeted agents ( i.e. , lapatinib ) ( ) .	111	134	18	response 
A phase II study supported by the above preclinical data was then conducted using the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and afatinib in NSCLC patients who developed acquired resistance to first-generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> by clinical definition [ , ] .

The results are indicated as mean +/- SD of sextuplicate wells and are representative of three independent experiments ( B and C ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is effective against SW48 ( EGFR G719S mutant ) -induced tumors but not HCT8 ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant ) induced-tumors in xenografted mice .	23	39	40	resistance or non-response

One mechanism to resistance was recently elucidated : cetuximab resistant cells contain an EGFR mutation in the extracellular domain ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) that impairs cetuximab , but not epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding . Therefore , since the response to therapy require the EGFR target to be present , the development of BOI methods for quantitative detection of EGFR protein levels in CRC primary and secondary tumor tissues is necessary , in order to guide the treatment of individual selected for EGFR targeted antibody treatment and in particular those who relapse while on EGFR targeting therapies . The advent of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> targeted antibodies , cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has paved the way to individualized medicine of mCRC .	106	100	20	response
Consistent with this , we found that the introduction of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> into <ANNO_TYPE_gene> had no negative impact on sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( IC50 47 ± 8 nm ) .	20	12	10	sensitivity
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> may therefore stabilize an active conformation that is both more oncogenic and less favored for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding . This screen has several potential limitations . Ba/F3 cells in vitro are unlikely to faithfully recapitulate the cellular context of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> primary human tumors .	16	39	0	 resistance 
The 16 mutations are located around the kinase active site and can be categorized into five groups , involved in either direct or indirect contacts with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The three mutations that conferred the strongest resistance were the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper residue , S1206R at the solvent front , and G1269S near the DFG motif . Ba/F3 cells expressing native <ANNO_TYPE_gene> grew robustly as subcutaneous xenografts in SCID mice .	26	59	38	 resistance 
Consistent with this , we found that the introduction of R1275Q into <ANNO_TYPE_gene> had no negative impact on sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( IC50 47 ± 8 nm ) . As expected , the IC50 values for viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutants were all above that for Ba/F3 cells expressing native EML4-ALK , with IC50s ranging from 231 to 981 nm . The three most resistant mutants , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , S1206R , and G1269S , all had IC50s within twofold of parental , ALK negative , Ba/F3 cells ( IC50 1176 nm ) .	20	12	69	 resistance

However , analogous Ba/F3 xenografts expressing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , S1206R , or G1269S mutants were completely insensitive to these doses , with no statistically significant changes in tumor growth rate . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is not efficacious in mouse Ba/F3 xenograft models expressing <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants .	30	40	6	 resistance 
However , the ability of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_gene> phosphorylation was substantially reduced in all mutants tested , with IC50s & gt ; 1000 nm for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G1269S ( ) .	5	8	26	 resistance 
In this study , we have used an accelerated mutagenesis strategy to identify an extensive set of mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> that can confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Alterations at 16 different amino acids were observed , with three of them , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , S1206R and G1269S , rendering cells completely insensitive in mouse xenograft studies .	25	19	41	 resistance 
By contrast , p-ALK levels were reduced by approximately 25–35 % at 6 h in tumors <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or S1206R , with a partial recovery at 24 h . There was no significant inhibition in tumors expressing the G1269S mutation . Drug exposure was similar in all models , confirming that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inactivity in the mutant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> efficacy studies is because of the inadequate target inhibition .	51	56	16 17	 resistance

KRAS mutations have recently been reported to be markers of resistance for EGFR-TKI and monoclonal antibodies against EGFR , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab [ – ] . <ANNO_TYPE_gene> is one of the kinase types that most frequently mutate in human tumors . In melanoma , colon and thyroid cancers , the tumor types with highest frequency of BRAF mutation , a single nucleotide substitution resulting in a gulutamic acid for valine substitution within the kinase domain at codon 600 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , accounts for the majority of cases [ ] .	19	26	79	resistance or non-response
Multiple analyses have demonstrated that responses to either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab occur exclusively within the 60–70 % of patients without activating mutations in codon 12 and 13 of KRAS [ , , , ] . The activating <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation is present in an additional 10 % of patients , and it may be predictive of a lack of response to anti-EGFR therapy [ ] in addition to a clear poor prognostic factor .	8	38	37	resistance or non-response

Potentiation of gemcitabine , camptothecin , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and oxaliplatin cytotoxicity by V158411 was dependent on <ANNO_TYPE_gene> status . In the p53 wild-type colon cancer cell line HCT116 , V158411 did not potentiate any of the four cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents tested ( Figure A ) . In comparison , V158411 potentiated all four agents by greater than 5-fold in the HT29 colon carcinoma cell line which harbors a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in p53 .	6	15	67	None
The LUX-LUNG 3 study [ ] , a multicenter , randomized , open-label phase III study compared afatinib with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> plus pemetrexed in patients with lung adenocarcinoma , stage IIIb/IV harboring <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations [ , ] . Among the 1,269 screened patients , 345 resulted eligible and were randomized in a two-to-one fashion to afatinib 40 mg daily or chemotherapy up to a maximum of six cycles ( without any maintenance therapy ) . As expected , patients were mainly East Asian , never-smokers and women ; EGFR mutations were predominantly exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutations .	19	31	95	None
These data indicate that all AKT isoforms become activated by mutant PI3K ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in HCC . Whether all AKT isoforms are involved in the oncogenic signalling has to be shown in further experiments .

Although <ANNO_TYPE_drug> extended recipient mouse survival for each xenograft tested , in some instances the effects were relatively modest and in all but one xenograft the mice ultimately died of ALL . Signaling through PI-3K can promote cell survival and proliferation through mTORC1 independent mechanisms [ - ] . Furthermore , inhibition of mTORC1 can result in phosphorylation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> on Ser473 by mTORC2 [ ] or on Thr308 due to loss of the negative feedback loop through <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and further activation of PI-3K [ ] .	1	59	78	None

Some of the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance include T790M second mutation , mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) amplification , ATP binding cassette (ABC)-G2 transporter ( ABCG2 ) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) overexpression , insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein-3 ( IGFBP3 ) downregulation , as well as ERBB3 activation .

Mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( H1047R ) have been shown to enhance HER2 mediated transformation by amplifying the ligand induced signaling output of the HER family of RTKs [ ] . It could be therefore be assumed that because PIK3CA mutations drive HER related receptor addiction in these cells it would make them more susceptible to RTK inhibition ( as seen here with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib ) ( Figure ) . Cells containing the PIK3CA mutation E545K were found to be more sensitive than those with the PIK3CA mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , suggesting that not all activating mutations found within a given gene will result in the same activity to targeted therapy .	62	2	88	None
Cells with PIK3CA mutations H1047R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> showed greatest single agent sensitivity to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor . Interestingly , cells with these mutations also showed greater sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib than cells with the EGFR mutation ( exon 19 deletion ) , which are associated with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC .	28	14	6	None
Carboplatin was discontinued and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> was initiated as a second-line chemotherapy . For the first cycle , a total of 85 mg ( 40 mg/m2 ) of liposomal <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in 250 ml of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( 5 % glucose solution ) was prescribed with the same premedications used for the prior carboplatin .	28	4	33	None
Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and Wnt pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibition by the addition of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( T315I ) following imatinib . Although the MET <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation renders cancers insensitive to type I MET inhibitors , conformal differences between these and type II compounds may allow treatment of MET Y1230H mutant cancers or prevent the emergence of resistance due to the mutation. ,	53	47	131	None
Of note was that a response was seen in three patients with medullary thyroid cancer who had been pretreated with vandetanib or sorafenib ( which also target VEGFR and RET ) , supporting the concept of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> being a VEGF inhibition escape pathway and thus a valid target . Mutational analysis was carried out as part of the trial , and identified 15 patients harboring <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , a RET mutation associated with poor prognosis . Of these , 12 had a response or stable disease with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , noted by the authors to be in contrast with motesanib , which showed no activity in this subset of patients .	86	36	65	None
The dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR might be advantageous over single inhibition by suppressing a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> feedback loop that leads to the pathway reactivation . Based on this idea , an on-going phase I study of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and mTORC1/2 dual inhibitor , BEZ235 , was designed for the patients with advanced solid tumors harboring PIK3CA or PTEN alteration ( NCT01195376 ) .

These observations could be due to the presence of concurrent drug resistance mechanisms ( such as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification ) , or to the inability of dacomitinib to fully inhibit EGFR in tumors harboring EGFR T790M at the doses currently under clinical investigation . Strategies to improve EGFR inhibition in EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cancers include the combination of irreversible EGFR inhibitors with the EGFR‐directed <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( as reported for afatinib plus cetuximab ) 19 ; the development of more potent and specific inhibitors of EGFR T790M20,21 ; and the use of intermittent but high doses of existing irreversible EGFR inhibitors .	62 63	16	50	None

In contrast , where resistance is mediated by compensatory signaling pathways , or tumors harbor more than one concomitant drug resistance mechanism , combination strategies with targeted agents in appropriately selected patients will be necessary to treat such cancers ( eg , inhibition of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway ) .	26 27	102	7	None

To investigate cell-specific EGFR signaling dynamics , we constructed an H1299WT model ( WT model ) , an H1299EGFR-WT model ( EGFR-WT model ) , and two alternate H1299L858R models ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A with Mig6 overexpression and L858R model B with Cbl overexpression ) .	6	57	90	None
As a result , the combination of a lower k3 ( the rate constant for the forward reaction of the EGFR phosphorylation ) and k8 ( the rate constant for the forward reaction of binding of EGFR to Shc ) contributed to effectively inhibit the total phosphorylation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Figure ) .

Despite the higher rates of molecular response , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is emerging as a common mechanism of failure of second-line TKIs [ ] . It was reported that combined treatment with nilotinib or dasatinib with SGX393 ( inhibitor of native and T315I-mutant BCR/ABL ) might be useful for reduction of BCR/ABL mutants in Ph-chromosome positive leukemia [ ] . In addition , it was shown that combined treatment with dasatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA ) <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor ) led to depletion of wild-type and mutant forms of BCR/ABL expressing cells [ ] .	71	79 80	8	None
To explore potential <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance mechanisms in model EC039 , we screened for mutations in a panel of genes ( EGFR , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , B-raf and PIK3CA ) across all 5 PDECX models and their corresponding patient EC tissues . Screened gene locations included ; exons 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 of EGFR gene , exons 2 and 3 of K-ras gene , exons 11 and 15 of B-raf gene , and exons 9 and 20 of PI3KCA gene .

Despite initial sensitivity and responses that in many cases can be maintained over periods of many months or even years , tumors with EGFR mutations or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene rearrangements treated with specific inhibitors will ultimately progress—a process termed acquired resistance . In the case of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib in EGFR mutant tumors two major mechanisms have been identified . Firstly , a secondary mutation , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation within exon 20 of EGFR , is responsible for about 50 % of instances of acquired resistance [ , ] .	48	26	69	None

This findings show that EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is a common resistance mechanism to both reversible , and when amplified , the irreversible EGFR inhibitors . In our case , the response duration of irreversible EGFR inhibitor was 11 months which was unusually longer than those of initial gefitinib ( for 4 months ) and second round <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( for 6 months ) treatments . Recently an alternative approach is to develop novel strategies , instead of irreversible EGFR inhibitors , to inhibit EGFR and/or EGFR signaling , including the use of inhibitors of HSP90 and/or EGFR downstream signaling ( such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors ) as these resistant cancers still remain dependent on EGFR signaling for their growth .	55	103	5	None

Besides being able to quickly export glutathione conjugated platinum , upregulated expression of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> is also associated with decreased formation of platinum-DNA adducts and decreased G2-arrest in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cell lines [ ] .

<ANNO_TYPE_variant> family members play an important role in the control of gene expression in several phases of the cell cycle and in multiple checkpoints .

However , a higher concentration of E2 ( 1.0 nM ) prolonged APD ( 168.89 ms ) ( Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> – left panel ) . For endocardial cells , APD is lengthened by 1 nM E2 from 184.22 ms ( 0 nM E2 ) to 189.54 ms. APD is slightly increased to 184.95 ms in the presence of 0.1 nM E2 . Figure S2B shows that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> reduced APD <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .5 nM to 157.64 ms in epicardial and 175.79 ms in endocardial cell .	66	69 70	19	None

Three initial base models were compared : model 1 contained only environmental factors , including the type of platinum , baseline Scr , smoking status , coadministration of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and the number of chemotherapy cycles ; model 2 contained only genetic factors , including <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Arg72Pro and ERCC1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ; and model 3 contained both genetic and environmental factors .	28	45	49	None
In fact , there was a markedly increased pErk signal in one NRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated cell line ( M207 ) , an observation consistent with data from others that has been attributed to loss of negative regulatory pathways [ , ] and enhanced signaling through C-Raf [ , ] . Therefore , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway signaling specifically in cell lines that harbor the BRAFV600E mutation .	52	54	13	None
It would be interesting to study in the future if <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , CTBP , MECP2 , LSD1 or other yet-to-be identified REST interactors are involved . Notably , we did not observe pathways specifically enriched in any group of REST targets with different <ANNO_TYPE_drug> occupancies . In summary , our results indicate that SIN3 co-localization was correlated with higher expression while EZH2/CoREST co-occupancy was associated with lower levels of expression of REST targets , with SIN3 seemingly dominant over <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	43	79	10	None
In this report we showed that GNF-2 cooperated with the Abl kinase inhibitors (AKIs) , Imatinib , Nilotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , in inhibiting clonigenicity of Bcr-Abl <ANNO_TYPE_variant> transformed <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells .	19	28	26	None
Levels of pSTAT5α were also marginally reduced when GNF-2 was applied in the presence of Imatinib , Nilotinib ( Figure ) and significantly reduced in the presence <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Figure ) .

The 16 mutations are located around the kinase active site and can be categorized into five groups , involved in either direct or indirect contacts with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The three mutations that conferred the strongest resistance were the L1196M gatekeeper residue , S1206R at the solvent front , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> near the DFG motif . <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells expressing native EML4-ALK grew robustly as subcutaneous xenografts in SCID mice .	26	55	49	None
Consistent with this , we found that the introduction of R1275Q into EML4-ALK had no negative impact on sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( IC50 47 ± 8 nm ) . As expected , the IC50 values for viability of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells expressing these mutants were all above that for Ba/F3 cells expressing native EML4-ALK , with IC50s ranging from 231 to 981 nm . The three most resistant mutants , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , S1206R , and G1269S , all had IC50s within twofold of parental , ALK negative , Ba/F3 cells ( IC50 1176 nm ) .	20	38	69	None

The combination of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has a synergistic effect in inhibiting EGFR signaling The only difference between the EGFR-WT model and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A is in the negative EGFR regulation produced by Mig6 , therefore , which can be experimentally verified by overexpressing Mig6 .	5	3	23	None
BRAF ( v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 ) , a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , is the downstream effector of KRAS in the RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway . A somatic mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 15 of BRAF has been identified in multiple human cancers with a mutation rate of 66 % in malignant melanomas [ ] and at lower frequency in other human carcinomas . Recently , it was demonstrated that wildtype BRAF is required for the response of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab [ ] .	86	12 13	31	None
In contrast , the median <ANNO_TYPE_gene> for patients without T315I had not yet been reached , and the estimated 20-month survival rate was 70 % .

Also , a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) demonstrated antitumor activity in tumors with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and confirmed that V600E BRAF is a valid therapeutic target in human cancer [ ] . Therefore , recent guidelines for anti-EGFR therapies has forced assessment for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation in codons 12 and 13 in colorectal cancer .	10	49	20	None
Because mutations in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene result in activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway , only metastatic colorectal cancer patients with wild-type KRAS tumors qualify for anti-EGFR targeted therapies with cetuximab or panitumumab [ ] .

H1975 cells harbor two mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T790M ) in the EGFR gene . All cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated fetal calf serum ( FCS , JRH Biosciences , Lenexa , Kansas ) .

This findings show that EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is a common resistance mechanism to both reversible , and when amplified , the irreversible EGFR inhibitors . In our case , the response duration of irreversible EGFR inhibitor was 11 months which was unusually longer than those of initial <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( for 4 months ) and second round gefitinib ( for 6 months ) treatments . Recently an alternative approach is to develop novel strategies , instead of irreversible EGFR inhibitors , to inhibit EGFR and/or EGFR signaling , including the use of inhibitors of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and/or EGFR downstream signaling ( such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MEK inhibitors ) as these resistant cancers still remain dependent on EGFR signaling for their growth .	46	92	5	None
Clinical trials of new small molecule TKIs ( e.g. <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , sorafenib and midostaurin ) were not ideal against T674I PDGFRα despite these drugs in vitro activity .

Based on our data , we hypothesized that PRR of hnRNP L binds to PTB and cooperatively suppresses inclusion of exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . We thus examined the role of PRR of hnRNP L on the interaction with PTB . Histidine tagged hnRNP L ( His-L ) , its <ANNO_TYPE_gene> deleted variant ( His-L-ΔPRR ) , histidine tagged hnRNP LL ( His-LL ) , and its PRR inserted variant ( His-LL-PRR ) were expressed in SH-SY5Y cells , and they were immunoprecipitated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> antibody in the presence of RNase .	82	48	21	None

This then indicates that whatever the E465K mutation is doing at high <ANNO_TYPE_drug> concentrations , it acts both downstream and independent of functional rab-3 , which itself is downstream of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . Interestingly , the E465K mutation is modelled on a Sly1p ( yeast Sec1/Munc18 protein ) that bypasses the requirement for a functional <ANNO_TYPE_gene> protein during ER to Golgi vesicle trafficking [ ] .	12	54	30	None

The promoter of the cyclin A1 gene , CCNA1 is not <ANNO_TYPE_variant> dependent and , consistently , increasing doses of Roscovitine did not repress cyclin A1 basal transcription levels in contrast to cyclins A2 , B , D and E . However , we demonstrated that Roscovitine at doses preferentially inhibiting CDK2 but not CDK7 and 9 completely abolished cyclin A1 DNA damage induced upregulation , thus suggesting that residual <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activity is required for cyclin A1 upregulation . In addition Roscovitine co-administered with doxorubicin was able to largely modify the patterns of cell cycle phase distribution in comparison to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> only treatment .	100	70	11	None

Recently , genome-wide screening for the genetic determinants of gout found that an SNP of ABCG2/BCRP ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is associated with high uric acid levels , and demonstrated that uric acid is a natural substrate of ABCG2/BCRP. , ABCG2/BCRP also appears to play a protective role against xenobiotics and their metabolites. , The typical ABCG2/BCRP substrates , irinotecan and SN-38 , are detoxified by glucuronidation with uridine-diphosphate–glucuronyltransferase , and ABCG2/BCRP can extrude SN-38–glucuronide . Interestingly , ABCG2/BCRP can transport another of the glucuronide conjugates , 17-β-estradiol 17- ( β-D-glucuronide ) , and the sulfated conjugates estrone-3-sulfate <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are also substrates of ABCG2/BCRP. , The apical localization of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in the intestinal epithelium and the bile canalicular membrane also suggests the intestinal absorption and hepatobiliary excretion of ABCG2/BCRP substrates. , – ABCG2/BCRP may also play a protective role by transporting dietary carcinogens .	97 98	109	17	None
A phase I dose escalation study was conducted in Japanese patients in order to test the efficacy of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , an oral EGFR inhibitor .

Several studies have reported renal failure and tumor lysis syndrome during TKI based molecular targeted therapies , including with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma , with imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia , and with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.– Because the Q141K variant of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> corresponding to SNP 421C&gt ; A reduces uric acid transport and those TKIs are substrates/inhibitors of ABCG2/BCRP , TKI therapy in patients with the SNP 421C&gt ; A ( Q141K ) may be at higher risk of tumor lysis syndrome . A defect in the pharmacological interaction has been suggested between sunitinib and another ABCG2/BCRP germ-line mutant allele , 1291T & gt ; C. Remarkably , sunitinib reversed wild-type ABCG2/BCRP mediated drug resistance and competitively inhibited ABCG2/BCRP mediated estrone 3-sulfate transport and the binding of 125I-iodoarylazidoprazosin to ABCG2/BCRP . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant of ABCG2/BCRP , which is expressed from a germ-line mutant allele 1291T & gt ; C , was insensitive to sunitinib mediated inhibition .	33	43	134	None

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> was designed through SAR optimization of lead 5-H-pyrimido [ 5,4-d ] [ 2 ] benzazepine . It is currently in numerous Phase II clinical studies . It does not appear to have any significant off-target effects towards other kinases included in the panel , but it has been shown to inhibit wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BCR-ABL effectively in both kinase assays and in vitro cell cultures [ ] .	0	53	55	None

Overall , the study emphasize the potential role of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as an agent that do not necessarily select for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance and allow the sequential use of non-cross-resistant EGFR TKIs . BMS-690514 , a reversible oral inhibitor of EGFR , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and −4 , VEGFRs-1 to −3 , showed antitumour activity in tumour xenograft models and in cell lines containing the EGFR T790M mutation , suggesting a role against erlotinib-resistant tumours [ ] .	9	41	19	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> , an oral small-molecule inhibitor of EGFR , VEGFR-2 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and Ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EphB4) , in preclinical studies showed efficacy against EGFR-driven tumors , including those harboring <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ ] .	0	11	31	None
Surprisingly , the effect of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was less pronounced on <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells . As expected , Imatinib failed to inhibit BCR-ABL and CRKL phosphorylation in BaF3 cells carrying mutated BCR-ABL . We have previously reported that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells exhibited constitutive activation of ERK1/2 as a mechanism of resistance to this TKI [ , ] .	5	10	36	None
Lazzara and colleagues found that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Y542 phosphorylation was not induced in response to EGF in the H3255 cells , which harbor the missense <ANNO_TYPE_variant> exon 21 mutation , suggesting that SHP2 activity may be less efficiently promoted by EGFR L858R and the STAT3 pathway may be more active . The main problem is that STAT3 activation is not abrogated by single EGFR TKI treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , afatinib or dacomitinib , - .	66	5	24	None

Surprisingly , the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation leads to decreased ability to activate ERK compared to WT EGFR which correlates with decreased EGFR internalization , reduced phosphorylation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , hyperactivity of STAT3 and reduced sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	36	27	4	None
Exogenous lipoic acid equilibrates among different intracellular and extracellular compartments but can not substitute for covalently bound lipoic acid ( as the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> of mitochondrial complexes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase ) . This study is aimed at establishing the effects of lipoic acid , on glucose uptake , insulin signaling through the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway , and synaptic plasticity on a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease ( 3xTg-AD ) . This transgenic model harbors PS1 ( M146V ) , APP ( Swe ) , and tau ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) transgenes , shows progressive development of both plaques and tangles with increasing age in a region specific manner : ~6 month-old 3xTg-AD mice show diffuse amyloid plaques in different regions but tangle pathology is established at ~12 months [ ] .	22	55	91	None
Inhibition of ALK activity in NB cell lines has already been approached by using specific small molecule ALK inhibitors , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] , NVP-TAE684 [ ] and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] , and more recently by RNA interference molecules [ ] . Particularly , NB cells harboring either <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or ALK amplification showed sensitivity to PF-02341066 and these results were also confirmed in xenografts ( Wood AC et al. , ASCO Annual Meeting , 2009 ) .	22	30	50	None

To evaluate the performance of the method , we analyzed the binding of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> (MTX) to Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase ( eDHFR ) . The binding between MTX and eDHFR is well characterized and a series of eDHFR mutants are available , which bind to MTX with wide range of affinity , . We prepared <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tagged constructs of eDHFR wild-type ( WT ) and three eDHFR mutants ( eDHFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , eDHFR L54G and eDHFR F31V , L54G ) for which the reported Kd values to free MTX range from low pM to low µM , .	13	55	70	None
Helman described their preclinical results on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , an old antibiotic from streptomyces , which they have identified in a 56,000 natural product EWS-FLI1 signature based screen ( Grohar et al. , ) ( Table ) . He reviewed published molecular ( inhibition of EWS-FLI1 cooperating transcription factors SP1 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and ETS ) and first clinical results in a patient with ES ( Kofman et al. , ) , and reported on their own findings of tumor regression in TC32 xenografts .	6	50	50	None

We also tested the ability of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> to synergize with a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> (CPM) based chemo-radiation regimen using the same glioblastoma model . CPM has been used to treat glioblastoma in the clinic [ ] and has been widely studied in the context of immunotherapy [ , ] . We used a dose ( 100 mg/kg ) that exhibited no therapeutic benefit as a single agent ( Additional file : Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and did not prolong survival when added to RT alone ( Additional file : Figure S3B ) .	11	6	70	None

Although the resistant cell line <ANNO_TYPE_gene> does not have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , it was found to have MET amplification . MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is associated with the development of various human cancers . Therefore , EGFR-TKIs fail to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway dependent growth signal because the constitutive phosphorylation of HER3 by MET occurs independent of EGFR activation , which causes the cells to acquire resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	5	11	None

However , three of four patients harboring the rare EGFR mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( X indicates substitution of glycine by either serine , cysteine , or alanine ) were found to respond to neratinib ( Sequist et al. , ) . Strikingly , neratinib showed promising activity in ERBB2 overexpressing breast cancers and could potentially be approved as a first-line therapy in locally advanced or metastatic ERBB2 overexpressing breast cancers ( Chow et al. , ; Limentani et al. , ; Burstein et al. , ; Awada et al. , ) . Preclinical activity for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( BIBW2992 ) , a second irreversible inhibitor of EGFR and ERBB2 , was demonstrated in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells expressing an ERBB2-mutant with an insertional mutation at codon 776 and in transgenic lung cancer models ( Li et al. , ) .	94	111	11	None
Further TKI improvement came from the higher binding affinity and selectivity than imatinib through the follow-up substance <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( AMN107 ) [ ] . In addition , bosutinib ( SKI-606 ) was developed , a second line inhibitor which has the broadest target spectrum inhibiting SRC , ABL and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , as well as serine kinases CAMK2G and STE20 , but bosutinib does not target PDGFR and KIT [ , ] . Finally , the third line inhibitor ponatinib has been developed and shown to exhibit substantial efficacy in patients with CML in whom the polyresistant BCR-ABL1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is expressed in leukemic cells [ ] .	17	49	97	None

A similar situation is found in the tethered membrane complex caa3-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> of Thermus thermophilus where the ET pathway from heme c to the CuA centre does not involve water , but rather the D-pyrrole and D-propionate of heme c to the cis amide N and α C of Phe126 of the cupredoxin domain . The mutations had no significant effect on the specific activity of the enzyme and in single turnover experiments where reduced RpNiR was reoxidised by nitrite , the ET efficiency from heme to T2Cu was similar to the wild-type enzyme , with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant showing a small decrease in rate ( see ) . These small effects suggests that the conserved water molecule H-bonded to the solvent exposed T1Cu <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ligand and the carbonyl of the peptide bond of Ala138 plays a dominant role in ET in this tethered complex .	125	11 12 13	98	None

Jin et al also reported that the HDAC inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , inhibits HDAC activity by downregulating cyclin D1 protein expression in colonic carcinoma cells in xenografted mice . In conclusion , our study confirms that valproic acid significantly suppresses growth of Kasumi-1 cell xenograft tumors in nude mice via cell cycle arrest . The antitumor activity of valproic acid is possibly attributable to its direct downregulation of cyclin D1 , CDK4/6 , and cyclin E1 expression , blockage of Rb phosphorylation , reduction of free <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , inhibition of HDAC activity , attenuation of histone acetylation in the p21 promoter region , upregulation of p21 expression , and induction of cell cycle arrest .	10	86	86	None

A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( T315I ) following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Although the MET <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation renders cancers insensitive to type I MET inhibitors , conformal differences between these and type II compounds may allow treatment of MET Y1230H mutant cancers or prevent the emergence of resistance due to the mutation. ,	71	66	76	None
One special group of patients , those harbouring a T315I mutation in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain , warrants further discussion . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation has been shown to mediate resistance to all three tkis ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib , nilotinib ) , and therefore patients with this particular mutation should be evaluated for an allogeneic hsct or offered experimental therapy if transplantation is not a suitable option .	35	13	22	None
The second generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib are effective in most CML patients following failure of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy .

( B ) Murine BM cells transduced with unmutated BCR-ABL and single point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , E255K , and T315I genes were tested for the effectiveness of 1R-Chl ( 125 nM to 1000 nM ) , 1S-Chl ( 500 nM and 1000 nM ) , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 500 nM and 5000 nM ; IC50 = 260 nM for the native BCR-ABL transduced cells ) , and dasatinib ( 10 nM and 100 nM ; IC50 = 0.8 nM for the native <ANNO_TYPE_gene> transduced cells ) .	45	81	14	None
In these CML-BC patients , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance often depends on reactivation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase activity via mechanisms involving BCR/ABL overexpression , gene amplification or mutations that suppress imatinib mediated kinase inhibition ( i.e. E255V and G250E ) or disrupt imatinib binding ( i.e. <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( ) .	5	12	44	None
Preliminary results from an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study of the multikinase , pan–BCR-ABL inhibitor ponatinib ( AP24534 ) showed antileukemic activity in patients with refractory CML , including patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Phase 1 and 2 trials of ponatinib are ongoing in patients with refractory CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Danusertib ( PHA-739358 ) is a multikinase aurora inhibitor with in vitro activity against wild-type ABL and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ; preliminary results from an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study indicate antileukemic activity in patients with AP or BC who failed <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and/or nilotinib or dasatinib .	93	71	31 32	None
Addition of AKIs at 10 nM with various concentration of GNF-2 did not sensitize Ba/F3 p185 <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells to GNF-2 dependent clonigenicity inhibition ( data not shown ) . However , presence of AKIs at 100 nM showed a marginal cooperation between GNF-2 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and Nilotinib ( Figure - ) and a greater cooperation with Dasatinib ( Figure ) .	45	16	17	None
To compare their efficacy and binding pattern with our screened compounds we again docked FDA approved drugs with wild-type of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . As shown in , DB07107 and DB06977 showed better docking scores than existing drugs while others showed results comparable to those of marketed drugs like ponatinib , bosutinib , bafetinib , dasatinib , nilotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . In the case of DB06977 , although one H_bond is missing ( Met318 ) with the wild-type of BCR-ABL complex compared to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant type , it still exhibits a favorable binding score of −10.94 kcal/mol .	57	20	81	None
A plethora of different mutations mediating <ANNO_TYPE_drug> have been described . Most of these mutant BCR–ABL1 proteins are still sensitive to the second generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib . In addition , the recently approved ponatinib is active against the most common mutation that causes resistance to both first and second generation ABL TKIs , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( Table ; Figure ) .	6	24	58 59	None
An experiment using cell lines transfected concurrently with activating mutations and a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation also proved that resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib is evident when this mutation is present [ – ] . Analogous secondary mutations of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene in case of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) [ ] and the KIT gene in case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor [ ] have previously been reported as mechanisms of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance , which is also a TKI .	70	38	12	None
Although there are many potential mechanisms for development of clinical resistance , most cases of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CML are due to point mutations in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain itself , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ , ] .	15	24	30	None

The data suggest that low BRCA1 level may neutralize the negative effects of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> T790M mutation on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity and that high BRCA1 expression may lead to de novo EGFR TKI resistance potentially through increased DNA damage repair capacity [ ] . In addition to EGFR T790M , primary EGFR TKI resistance may also be due to other secondary mutations in EGFR ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) that occur in cis with an activating EGFR kinase domain mutation ( e.g. , L858R ) [ ] .	18	14	66	None
In addition to the EGFR T790M mutation , there are three other second-site mutations in EGFR that have been associated with acquired EGFR TKI resistance : T854A in exon21 [ ] , L747S [ ] , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ ] , both in the exon19 . Similar to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> T790M mutation , alteration of the drug contact residue T854 to a smaller hydrophobic alanine may increase the size of the selectivity pocket and negatively impact <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding .	76	49	37	None
Similar to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> T790M mutation , alteration of the drug contact residue T854 to a smaller hydrophobic alanine may increase the size of the selectivity pocket and negatively impact <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is thought to shift the equilibrium towards the active conformation of the receptor , while D761Y may affect the catalytic cleft of the receptor .	30	3	33	None

In GIST and HES , respectively , the analogous T670I mutation in KIT and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in PDGFR-alpha have been associated with acquired resistance to this drug [ , ] . To determine whether lung cancers that acquire clinical resistance to either gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> display additional mutations in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain , we have examined the status of EGFR exons 18 to 24 in tumors from five patients who initially responded but subsequently progressed while on these drugs .	44	50	14	None
Analogously , the T790M mutation , in conjunction with the drug-responsive del L747–E749 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutant , prevents inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( C ) .	22 23	21	13 14	None
Cells bearing the mutant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> are in general more sensitive to TKIs than cells expressing the wild-type kinase . In particular , the L858R mutant is 10- to 100-fold more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib than the wild-type kinase , ,, and significantly more sensitive than the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	32	4	47	None
At least 10 other activating mutations ( less common single amino acid substitutions such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , L747S , and T854A ) have been reported within the kinase domain and the novel E884K mutation has been associated with resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .

The second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors , dasatinib and nilotinib , can circumvent most mutations that confer resistance to imatinib ; the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , however , causes resistance to all BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors developed so far . Similarly , the T790M point mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) confers resistance to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer .	59	53	20	None
The EGFR ( HER1 ) -Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( TKI ) gefitinib ( ZD1839 ; Iressa ) was kindly provided by AstraZeneca ( AstraZeneca PLC Headquarters , 15 Stanhope Gate , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> 1 LN , London , UK ) .

Together , the data indicate that AXL kinase activation is necessary and sufficient to promote <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in these <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutant NSCLC models . The analysis indicated that an <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in AXL would be expected to result in steric clash with XL-880 and would block the ability of XL-880 to inhibit AXL .	15	19	29	None
Interestingly , cells with these mutations also showed greater sensitivity to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than cells with the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation ( exon 19 deletion ) , which are associated with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC .

In addition , other <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations have also demonstrated contribution to the development of drug resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib , including secondary EGFR kinase mutations , L858R mutations , and secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutations .	17	4	32	None
Graph shows that the common L858R mutation confers higher autophosphorylation levels to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> than P848L and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . Images show that , unlike L858R , these uncommon exon 21 mutants did not induce phosphorylation of endogenous Akt . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> blocked L858R induced pAkt at 10 nM , and caused relocation of the ectopic protein into fibrils at 100 nM .	38	12	16	None
Less frequent activating mutations including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 18 and L861Q in exon 21 have also been described . Prospective studies of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKIs in patients with EGFR mutations have consistently identified high response rates and prolonged progression free survival . The Spanish Lung Cancer Group screened 2105 patients , to identify 350 patients ( 15 % ) with exon 19 deletions and L858R of whom 250 patients went on to receive <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the first or second-line setting .	72	22	5	None
The EGFR ( HER1 ) -Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( TKI ) gefitinib ( ZD1839 ; Iressa® ) was kindly provided by AstraZeneca ( AstraZeneca PLC Headquarters , 15 Stanhope Gate <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> 1LN , London , UK ) . The <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( HER1 ) TKI <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Tarceva® ) was a kind gift from Roche	45	40	30 31	None
<ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation tests were available in four patients , in whom three of them were positive for point mutation in exon 21 ( L858R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and one was negative . At the time of initiation of gefitinib treatment , most of the patients were in good performance status ( & gt ; 90 % in ECOG 0 or 1 ) . Gefitinib was prescribed at standard dosage of 250 mg daily and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at 150 mg daily .	74	0	25	None
A head-to-head trial comparing afatinib to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is still missing . Considering that it is at a minimum equivalent to reversible TKIs , afatinib should be currently considered an alternative drug to use for front-line treatment of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutated patients . In particular , afatinib should be used in patients with classical mutations in the EGFR gene ( exon 19 deletions and exon 21 point mutations ) and could be considered in the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L861Q mutations .	6	37	75	None
Finally , although molecularly targeted therapies ( that is , gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and crizotinib for ALK fusions ) are effective in NSCLC , intrinsic or acquired resistances inevitably lead to recurrence and/or metastatic dissemination . This is the case of MET activation/amplification , , or acquired somatic mutations of EGFR ( T790M ) or ALK fusions ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , L1196M and ALK amplification ) . , ,	12	14	60	None
All mutations with a relative frequency above 2 ( 0.2 % ) were then checked in PubMed by introducing the name of the mutation ( e.g. <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and added to the dataset if they were found to have functional effects . EGFR mutations conferring a response rate to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> higher than 50 % , according to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> somatic mutations database ( http : //www.somaticmutations-egfr.info/ ) , were also added .	49	58	26	None
The L747S mutation lies at the start of the β3 strand and the α-C-helix [ ] and has analogous residues in BCR-ABL ( L237M ) and ERBB2 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or P ) that have been identified in TKI resistant disease [ ] . The occurrence of these secondary mutations spurred development of second and third generation irreversible TKIs which bind covalently to the cysteinyl-797 residue in the pocket of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> domain and overcome resistance driven by the T790M mutation [ ] . These agents show greater potency in the inhibition of kinase activity in vitro and in vivo compared to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and are in various stages of clinical testing [ , ] .	101	70	27 28	None
FDA approved <ANNO_TYPE_gene> targeted inhibitors include the low-molecular-weight ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors , such as gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and humanized monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain , notably cetuximab and panitumumab [ ] . Although high-level expression of EGFR ligands and/or increased EGFR gene copy numbers may be predictive markers for antitumor response by cetuximab in colon cancer [ - ] , and patients with RAS driven cancers are known not to benefit from cetuximab treatment , a clear molecular explanation of cancer response to cetuximab has remained elusive .

<ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations observed in patients with metastatic tumors are most frequently observed in exons 11 ( 67 % ) , 9 ( 10 % ) , 13 ( 1 % ) , or 17 ( 1 % ) , while platelet derived growth factor receptor-α ( PDGFRA ) mutations ( 10 % ) , which are less common than KIT mutations , occur mostly in exons 18 ( 6 % ) , 12 ( 0.7 % ) , or 14 ( 0.1 % ) .

In conclusion , this report suggests that patients with thymic carcinoma harboring the missense mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 13 of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene can be resistant to imatinib and may obtain a tumor response when treated with sorafenib , possibly related to the antiangiogenic activity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	46	21	15	None
These drugs inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and interestingly , they have also been demonstrated to be active in GIST harboring mutations predictive of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , such as mutations in exons 13 and 14 . Two cases of c-KIT mutated thymic cancers responsive to sorafenib have been reported : in one case , a patient with the missense mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 17 had a partial response lasting more than 15 months , while in the other case , stable disease was achieved in the presence of exon 11 deletion. ,	24	3	59	None

It was initially proposed that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation might prevent the proper binding of tyrosine kinase inhibitors via steric hindrance , similar to the corresponding gatekeeper mutations in BCR-ABL ( T315I ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( T670I ) that confer resistance to imatinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors .	43	33	6	None

For example , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is effective in treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with gene rearrangements that constitutively activate PDGFRB [ ] , of hypereosinophilic syndrome with activating mutations in PDGFRA [ ] , and of gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors associated with activating mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] ( all reviewed in [ ] ) . More recently , this paradigm has been extended to treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Several mutations have been identified in the context of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with NSCLC that are associated with clinical response to the small-molecule EGFR inhibitors gefitinib ( Iressa ) or erlotinib ( Tarceva ) [ , , ] , including in-frame deletions such as del L747–E749 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 19 , or L858R in exon 21 .	3	44	124 125	None
Similar mutations in the homologous residues of the kinase domains of PDGFRA ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( T670I ) account for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in some patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome and gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors , respectively [ , ] .	22	16	13	None

Using this insight , new small-molecule inhibitors have been identified that retain activity against the majority of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> BCR-ABL mutants [ , ] .

This shows how vemurafenib can be beneficial for tumors of one molecular phenotype ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant ) but potentially adverse for another ( HRAS/NRAS mutant ) . Molecular therapeutics in melanoma are not just restricted to treatments directed at the MAPK pathway . In a recent Phase II study of 43 patients with metastatic melanoma with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> aberrations ( mutation or amplification ) treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> an overall response rate of 23.3 % was observed [ ] .	65	56	14	None
In a melanoma study of 21 patients who received a sufficiently high dose of vemurafenib , 5 without the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutation did not respond to the drug ; however , of 16 patients with the mutation , 9 responded to vemurafenib and 7 did not [ ] . In a phase II study of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for advanced melanoma , a substantial proportion of patients with tumors characterized by mutation or amplification of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> responded to the drug whereas it had limited activity in a nonselected population of melanoma patients [ ] .	55	73	19	None

Patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> exon 9 mutant tumors achieve a better response to sunitinib , than those with exon 11 mutations . The PDGFRA exon 18 D842V point mutant activates PDGFRA both in vitro and in vivo [ , ] and is also <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant in vivo and in vitro [ , , ] , whereas other mutations affecting exon 18 ( D846Y , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , Y849K and HDSN845-848P ) are imatinib sensitive [ ] .	42	2	63	None
Given the limited sample size , the extent of tumor shrinkage could not be correlated either to mutational status or to other clinical features , such as tumor site , initial tumor size , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> duration , and extent of pathologic response . In light of these results the presence of a less sensitive mutation like Exon 9 or of a wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutational status should not be considered per se a contraindication to a preoperative treatment , the only exception being those point mutations with known complete resistance ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in Exon 18 on PDGRα gene ) .	34	62	90 91	None
The relation of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment and JAK2 mutation is explored by Jones et al. in 9 PV patients for whom pre-treatment samples were available [ ] . There are two cases that achieved complete haematologic remission and a 2–3-fold reduction in the percentage <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> alleles . According to these authors , the observed clinical benefit may be a consequence of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> rather than JAK2 inhibition .	3	61	43 44	None
Therefore , Phase II trials were conducted with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients with acral or mucosal melanoma or melanomas on chronically sun damaged skin that harbored <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations or amplifications . Response rates of 16 % –23 % with a small number of complete long-term responses have been seen , with no difference in response rates between the various melanoma subtypes.– Notably , the same KIT mutations <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and N822K ) that have shown response to treatment in gastrointestinal stromal tumors also show response in the treatment of melanoma .	8	25	66 67	None
Analogous secondary mutations of the BCR-ABL gene in case of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) [ ] and the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene in case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor [ ] have previously been reported as mechanisms of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance , which is also a TKI . The structural similarity between ABL and EGFR tyrosine kinases is considerably high , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in ABL corresponds to T790M in EGFR [ ] .	37	20	60	None
Due to steric interaction of the kitD816V mutation at the receptor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is effective only in patients with SM lacking this mutation . Indeed it demonstrates in vitro efficacy against wild-type KIT and certain transmembrane ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and juxta-membrane ( V560G ) <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants , but not the common kinase ( D816V ) domain mutants .	11	43	36	None
This effect was then described in the context of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced resistance , . The structure of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> D816V mutant has not yet been determined . Nevertheless , recent crystallographic data have suggested that the JMR auto-inhibitory conformation is destabilized in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , advocating a regulatory impact of this catalytic mutation .	9	17	42	None
A parallel situation is seen with gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) , in which activating mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinases <ANNO_TYPE_gene> or PDGFRA ( platelet derived growth factor receptor , alpha polypeptide ) contribute to the disease , and again <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is an effective treatment option improving patient survival [ ] . A similar clinical benefit is observed in patients with lung cancers harboring the two most common EGFR activating mutations , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and exon 19 deletions [ – , ] .	42	22	74	None
In a cell-line based mutagenesis study , the emergence of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations resistant to imatinib , nilotinib and dasatinib were compared : 20 different mutations were identified with imatinib mesylate , 10 with nilotinib ( including only 1 novel mutation , E292V ) and 9 with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .

Finally , in a combination experiment , hydrogen exchange in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> protein in the presence of both dasatinib and GNF-5 demonstrated changes in exchange near the ATP site that were nearly the same as those seen when dasatinib bound to wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . Taken together , the results provide evidence for allosteric communication between the two sites and indicate that the factors leading to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance are somehow overcome by simultaneous binding of GNF-5 some 25 Å away .	65	42	11	None

Results showed that ponatinib has the highest binding affinity towards the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with a docking score of −11.050 kcal/mol while bosutinib , bafetinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , nilotinib and imatinib showed −5.513 kcal/mol , −4.689 kcal/mol , −4.702 kcal/mol , −3.772 kcal/mol , −3.593 kcal/mol and −3.78 kcal/mol , respectively ( ) .	25 26	13	11	None
As shown in , DB07107 and DB06977 showed better docking scores than existing drugs while others showed results comparable to those of marketed drugs like ponatinib , bosutinib , bafetinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , nilotinib and imatinib . In the case of DB06977 , although one H_bond is missing ( Met318 ) with the wild-type of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> complex compared to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant type , it still exhibits a favorable binding score of −10.94 kcal/mol .	31	55	59	None
3xFLAG tagged native BCR-ABL and the gatekeeper mutant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> were transfected into 293T cells stably expressing Renilla luciferase-Hsp90 fusion protein . Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of inhibitors for 1 hour prior to cell lysis and the LUMIER assay .

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> is active against at least 100 of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations known to confer resistance to imatinib that have been tested to date , ( including many in the p-loop region ) , except for the T315I mutation and a few other mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , F317L/V , and T315A ) .	0	9	44	None
When considering a change in therapy , it is important to consider a BCR-ABL kinase domain mutational analysis. [ ] <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation T315I is resistant to all of the currently approved TKIs . Some mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , E255K/V , and F359V/C ) are less sensitive to nilotinib , and others ( F317L and V299L ) are less sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	60	20	36	None

A similar “gatekeeper” mutation ( T315I ) in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> fusion kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia cancer cells renders these leukemias resistant to the ABL kinase inhibitors gleevec <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , suggesting a conserved mechanism of resistance to TKIs [ ] . However , the T790 M mutation may also occur prior to treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib and therefore , may contribute to primary resistance [ ] . Several other EGFR mutations can also confer resistance to first generation TKIs such as D761Y and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ , ] .	28 29	9	85	None

For example , three BCR-ABL mutations ( T315I , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and F317L ) have a predicted role in abrogating binding of imatinib to BCR-ABL in resistant patients . The second-generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , binds to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with less stringent conformational requirements and was shown to be effective in inhibition of imatinib-resistant mutants .	35	39	9	None

With the exception of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , most <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations are inhibited by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and nilotinib .	12	7	4	None
However , since the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of BCR-ABL is highly resistant to imatinib , AMN107 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , this approach needs to be extended to include inhibitors of T315I <ANNO_TYPE_gene> to prevent this mutation from becoming more prevalent .	16	29	4	None
Moreover , as shown in , SHP2 physically associated with PECAM-1 more prominently in cells expressing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or T315I mutant as compared with cells expressing native <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , while these mutants had less significant effects on complex formation between SHP2 and Gab2 . We next examined the effect of dasatinib on tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in BaF3 cells expressing the T315I mutant , which is totally resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as well as imatinib but sensitive to the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib ( , ) .	69	27	17	None
Imatinib mesylate , along with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) such as nilotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ - ] , have changed the natural history of CML and have provided important treatment options for this leukemia that in the past was uniformly fatal . Despite such advances in the field , mutations rendering CML and Ph+ ALL patients non-responsive to TKI 's have been identified , including the threonine 315 to isoleucine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) mutation and several others , which differentially prevent binding of different TKIs to the active site of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain , thereby evading inhibition [ ] .	16	94	74	None

The majority of these patients also had other coexisting <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations . The coexisting point mutations on exon 20 that rendered the patients resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were G719A , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , W731 Stop , L858R , L 861Q and delE749_T751insVA [ ] .	25	9	29	None
The majority of these patients also had other coexisting <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations . The coexisting point mutations on exon 20 that rendered the patients resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , V769L , W731 Stop , L858R , L 861Q and delE749_T751insVA [ ] .	25	9	27	None
Transient transfection experiments utilizing COS-7 cells demonstrated that auto-phosphorylation of the original L858R <ANNO_TYPE_gene> was inhibited by lower concentrations of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib than the L858R-L747S or L858R-T790M constructs ( A ) . CL-387,785 partially overcame the observed inhibition ( B ) . To prove the functional significance of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , we generated Ba/F3 cell lines stably expressing mutant EGFR constructs [ ] .	20	13	50	None
To prove the functional significance of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , we generated Ba/F3 cell lines stably expressing mutant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> constructs [ ] . These cell lines , including L858R-L747S , proliferated in the absence of IL3 . Ba/F3-L858R cells were extremely sensitive to gefitinib ( D ) , whereas Ba/F3-L858R-T790M cells were highly resistant up to 1 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	57 58	18	7	None
Furthermore , three of the four responders with exon 20 mutations also had concurrent sensitizing <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations ( L858R ) [ ] . According to previous studies , the average response rate for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment in patients with exon 20 mutations was only 34 % . These mutations in exon 20 could be point mutations , such as V765M , S768I , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and T790M .	33	15	62	None
The <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( HER1 ) -Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( TKI ) gefitinib ( ZD1839 ; <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) was kindly provided by AstraZeneca ( AstraZeneca PLC Headquarters , 15 Stanhope Gate , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> 1 LN , London , UK ) .	15	1	31	None
However , a previously described single case of L862V <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation was associated with lack of response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and the same could have been the scenario with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutation .	18	9	29	None
T790M is mainly present in relapsed tumors after an initial response and secondary to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> therapy , , and it accounts for about half of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or elotinib . Therefore , T790M has been considered a specific marker for acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , D761Y and insertions in exon 20 also confer modest resistance to EGFR-TKIs .	28	14	47	None
Pao et al. and Kobayashi et al. identified four cases with lung adenocarcinoma harboring pre existing mutations of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> as delL747–E749 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , delE746–A750 , or delL747–S752 , prior to the use <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ , ] .	33 34	18	21 22	None
In <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , the main mutation seen after extended treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] ; the T766M resistance mutation was correctly predicted in EGFR through homology with resistance mutations seen in BCR-ABL , which was verified in vitro [ ] and discovered several years later in patients [ - ] .	11	1	14	None
The wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , EGFRvIII , and H-Ras ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) constructs were generously provided by Dr. Frank Furnari ( University of California , San Diego ) . Retrovirus packaging and infection were performed as previously described [ ] and stably infected cells were generated by selection with puromycin ( 1 μg/ml ) for 5 days , G418 ( 600 μg/ml ) for 2 weeks , or Hygromycin ( 100 μg/ml ) for 2 weeks prior to the subsequent experiments . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was purchased from SelleckChem and used at 10 μM .	81	2	9	None
Such successes include the use of HER2 fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) assay for selecting HER2 positive breast cancer patients receiving Herceptin treatment , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation assay for selecting non-small cell lung cancer patients to be treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and applying KRAS mutation assay to avoid exposing colorectal cancer patients with KRAS mutations to anti-EGFR mAbs . Recently , such biomarker based prospective patient selection strategy was applied to Phase 1 studies to expedite clinical development of several new targeted agents . Overall response rates from 50 % to near 80 % were achieved in early phase trials of crizotinib ( ALK inhibitor ) , as well as PLX-4032 ( R7204 ) and GSK2118436 ( bRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> inhibitors ) .	40	26	119	None
For tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) [ ] , mutations within the ATP pocket of the kinase domain may affect the interaction of the drug with its target : for example , the single amino acid mutation tyrosine/methionine ( T790M ) in the ATP binding pocket of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mediates secondary resistance to the EGFR TKIs erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ , ] . The T790M mutation in EGFR is structurally analogous to drug resistance mutations in other kinases such as BCR-ABL ( T315I ) , c-KIT ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and platelet derived growth factor receptor-α ( PDGFRα ) ( T674I ) [ ] .	59	49	96	None
Using the erlotinib-sensitive EGFR mutant NSCLC cell line HCC4006 harboring the delL747-E749 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR exon 19 , Suda et al. established that mesenchymal status , not a specific oncogenic activated protein , could sufficiently promote loss of EGFR dependence to confer resistance to erlotinib . More recently , Chang et al. confirmed that in the absence of the common second-site EGFR mutation T790M or MET amplification , acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> occurs in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutated PC9 cells that have undergone EMT .	73	76	13	None
To test this possibility , two types of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cells ( PC9 cells that endogenously express EGFR deletion mutant in exon19 of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene and HEK293T cells that exogenously express EGFR L858R mutant ) were transfected with an expression vector encoding the oncogenic K-Ras <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	8	22	44	None

A ) . Adenocarcinoma with an <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene mutation ( exon 19 deletion L747-E749 ; <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) was detected in a transbronchial biopsy specimen ; the patient was diagnosed with stage IV ( cT2N2M1b ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was elevated to 71.2ng/mL ( normal range & lt ; 5ng/mL ) .

Moreover , in all the 4 cases with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification , a higher expression of HGF was observed after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment than before treatment . These results indicate that HGF accelerates the expansion of the tumor cells with MET amplification . The cells with MET amplification as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was present in a small proportion of the tumor cells before EGFR-TKI treatment and became dominant during treatment with EGFR-TKIs , suggesting that HGF may play an important role in this process .	19	8	48	None
Although the resistant cell line HCG827GR does not have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , it was found to have MET amplification . MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is associated with the development of various human cancers . Therefore , EGFR-TKIs fail to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway dependent growth signal because the constitutive phosphorylation of HER3 by <ANNO_TYPE_gene> occurs independent of EGFR activation , which causes the cells to acquire resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	65	11	None
In NSCLC , resistance to the EGFR TKI gefitinib is associated with the positive selection of cells harbouring the gatekeeper <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation known to confer insensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . Su et al. [ ] demonstrated that in patients with EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs , the presence of low frequency subclones harbouring T790M mutations before the onset of treatment was associated with shorter progression-free survival , and Turke et al. [ ] showed that the presence of subclones with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification was associated with EGFR TKI resistance .	27	82	20	None
In NSCLC , resistance to the EGFR TKI <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is associated with the positive selection of cells harbouring the gatekeeper <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation known to confer insensitivity to gefitinib [ ] .

Some of the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance include T790M second mutation , mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) amplification , ATP binding cassette (ABC)-G2 transporter ( ABCG2 ) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) overexpression , insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein-3 ( IGFBP3 ) downregulation , as well as ERBB3 activation . T790M mutation The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> second mutation accounts for half of all resistances to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib [ ] .	67	18	57	None
However , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation may exist in only a small fraction of tumor cells before drug treatment , and the tumor cells harboring this mutation may be enriched over time during treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] . <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification	34	40	3	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> is present as a minor clone in NSCLC [ , ] and may be selected for during therapy [ ] . This mutation has been shown to prevent the activation of BIM in response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> but can be overcome by an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR [ ] . Other critical resistance mechanisms have been identified to be linked to the inhibition of EGFRMUT and include <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification [ - ] , PTEN loss [ ] , HER2 kinase domain [ ] or PIK3CA , and transformation to small cell lung cancer [ ] .	36	67	0	None
( B ) Drugs such as the 4-anilinoquinazolines gefitinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) [ ] and erlotinib ( Tarceva ) [ ] can inhibit the activity of EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant . ( C ) However , tumors develop resistance , in this case one possibility is through overexpression of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] .	10	48	27	None
Therefore , CPT-11 and gefitinib should have a synergistic beneficial effect in NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The mechanistic reasons behind the resistance to EGFR TKI are different , probably involving <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification .	18	38	34	None
In our patient , a somatic <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification was identified by genomic profiling , and the patient experienced a durable response to crizotinib , all without knowledge of the site of tumor origin . Similarly , another CUP patient was identified as harboring a somatic EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> alteration via hotspot testing and responded to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , an EGFR targeted therapy [ ] .	54	6	46	None
The firstly described and the most common event responsible for resistance is the acquisition of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> missense mutation , which is found in ≈ 50 % of patients progressing after an initial response to erlotinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] . Other less frequent mechanisms include secondary mutations within EGFR [ , ] , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification [ ] , HER2 amplification [ , ] , small cell histologic transformation [ ] .	36 37	55	16	None
To test this hypothesis and to clinically validate our preclinical findings , we measured the expression of AXL by IHC ( immunohistochemistry ) in 35 matched EGFR-mutant NSCLC specimens obtained from patients both prior to treatment with the EGFR TKIs erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and upon the development of EGFR TKI acquired resistance . In cases where enough material was available for additional studies , we also examined the specimens for GAS6 and vimentin ( as a marker for EMT ) expression by IHC ( scoring system shown in ) , EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> by sequencing , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification by FISH .	42	96	91	None
In addition to the documented changes , such as secondary T790M mutation , altered EGFR trafficking , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene amplification , –, EGFR genetic heterogeneity might also contribute to acquired TKI resistance through the selection of preexisting resistant wild clones , at least in a proportion of NSCLCs . The lack of an established therapeutic option for NSCLC patients who have progressive disease after EGFR TKI failure poses a great challenge to physicians in terms of how best to manage this growing group of lung-cancer patients . Second-generation TKIs that irreversibly inhibit the EGFR TKI domain may offer the potential for overcoming the resistance of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation to erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	111	18	106	None
Two patients with classic activating mutations exhibited de novo <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance and had concurrent genetic anomalies usually associated with acquired TKI resistance , specifically the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutation and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification .	9	29	25	None
The cell line H1975 has a sensitizing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> kinase domain mutation in exon 21 , but also a second mutation ( T790M , in cis , in the kinase domain ) rendering them resistant to the reversible TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib [ ] . Moreover , these cells express the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> receptor but without gene amplification [ ] .	38	50	7	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib represent the first generation of small EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) that selectively target the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR , blocking the downstream signaling of the receptor . The EGFR somatic mutations have emerged to be the most relevant predictor of response to these agents. , Thus , several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that the use of EGFR TKIs in patients with advanced treatment-naive NSCLC with EGFR mutations significantly improved the objective response rate ( ORR ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) compared with standard platinum based chemotherapy.– Unfortunately , all responders eventually develop resistance , most commonly because of the emergence of a gatekeeper mutation in the kinase domain , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR mutated NSCLC or amplification of mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) .	0	134	122	None
While the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation represents a direct mechanism for drug resistance that occurs at the level of drug accessibility to the target , there are a number of indirect mechanisms that involve the increased expression or activation of alternative growth factor receptors to maintain signal flux , despite EGFR inhibition . Perhaps the best characterized of these is the amplification of the Met receptor and/or elevated levels of its ligand HGF . In <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant NSCLC cell lines , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> drives ErbB3 dependent activation of the PI3K pathway .	73	79	2	None
<ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification is able to activate ERBB3 ( HER3 ) -dependent PI3K/Akt pathway , and ultimately lead to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance . Its occurrence is independent of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	18	0	26	None
For example , HCC827 cells undergo <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification and AXL induction upon adaption to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , , , and PC9 cells acquire the T790M mutation in EGFR that confers resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib . In addition , studies with TKI-resistant tumor specimens suggest alternative mechanisms that remain to be defined . In addition , H1975 cells , which express EGFR bearing the activating <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and the T790M gate-keeper mutation , were selected for resistance to the irreversible EGFR inhibitor , BIBW2992 .	14	6	64	None
Second-generation EGFR TKIs – such as neratinib , afatinib and dacomitinib – are effective in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> models , but to date their delivery in EGFR TKI-resistant patients have shown disappointing results in the clinic . Combination of afatinib with cetuximab in EGFR TKI-resistant patients resulted in a 30 % response rate and 75 % disease control rate , with significant gastrointestinal toxicity . Other mechanisms of resistance include <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification , with no commercially available inhibitor , HER2 amplification potentially amenable to treatment with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies or histological transformation to small-cell lung cancer , which requires cytotoxic chemotherapy .	15 16	73	19 20	None
Analyses were also performed for other polymorphisms in the EGFR gene : <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G497A , and in the EGF gene : A61G . Graziano et al. demonstrated the presence of the short variant of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene intron-1 and the G allele in codon 61 of the EGF gene ( higher EGF production ) to be a favourable predictive factor for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy .	62	36	12	None

In the study by Pentheroudakis et al. , patients with a mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene who received chemotherapy combined with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> had a median overall survival of 19 months , whereas patients with other KRAS mutations and KRAS-wild type gene subjects treated with the same modality had a considerably longer median survival of nearly 30 months [ – ] . Furthermore , there are many reports on patients with the wild-type KRAS gene who are refractory to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> treatment . The cause of refractoriness has been identified in ca. 15 % of mCRC patients as mutations in the BRAF gene , primarily <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution .	24	81	106	None
The cause of refractoriness has been identified in ca. 15 % of mCRC patients as mutations in the BRAF gene , primarily <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution . Raf family proteins are downstream of Ras proteins in the signal transduction pathway originating at <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . It comes as no surprise , then , that activating mutations in the BRAF gene occurring in cancer cells have a similar clinical effect to KRAS gene mutations , making them refractory both to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab [ , , – ] .	76	40	22	None
In the case of patient no. 39 , during the targeted <ANNO_TYPE_gene> treatment , it came to the selection of KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells ( which were present from the beginning in the tumor but at a low level of around 5 % , Fig. a ) and in consequence to the metastasis ( Fig. b ) . On the other hand , patient no. 40 did not respond to cetuximab—we even confirmed KRAS WT and BRAF WT status by real-time PCR methods . This reminds us that the patient could have a KRAS mutation in codon 146 [ ] or another molecular mechanism is involved in his lack of response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	111	11	21	None
Patients with the KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Erbitux ) had stabilization for a short period , and then novel metastatic foci occurred with KRAS mutated in the same codon 12 . Therefore , we might conclude that outcome of personalized treatment is highly associated with tumor heterogeneity observed in patients because the detected mutation was probably present in only 5 % of tumor cells . In the case of patient no. 39 , during the targeted <ANNO_TYPE_gene> treatment , it came to the selection of KRAS G12C cells ( which were present from the beginning in the tumor but at a low level of around 5 % , Fig. a ) and in consequence to the metastasis ( Fig. b ) .	9	80	4	None
Because mutations in the KRAS gene result in activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway , only metastatic colorectal cancer patients with wild-type KRAS tumors qualify for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> targeted therapies with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab [ ] . Also , a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor ( PLX4032 ) demonstrated antitumor activity in tumors with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and confirmed that V600E BRAF is a valid therapeutic target in human cancer [ ] .	34	30	60	None
In contrast , we have demonstrated that the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and PD153035 ( a specific EGFR TKI ) proved to be antagonistic in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell line , with no reduction in proliferation and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , HER2 , AKT and MAPK phosphorylation status when compared to either drug alone [ ] .	10	34	24	None
Previously , we demonstrated that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells do not rely on EGFR signaling to proliferate and that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has no effect upon EGFR , HER2 , AKT and MAPK phosphorylation status , and even the combination of cetuximab and the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035 , did not display enhanced toxicity when compared to either agent alone [ ] .	17	40	5	None
Genetic mutations of some common oncogenes associated with EGFR pathway , e.g . KRAS , BRAF ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , c-MET , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , AKT and PI3KC have also been investigated in these models by hot-spot mutation sequencing . Therefore , the non-response of GC xenografts to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> apparently can not be simply attributed to these oncogene mutations .	47	22	17	None

We examined the antiproliferative effects of isolated RxT , cisplatin and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatments on A431 , Caski and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells ( ) , which express high to low <ANNO_TYPE_gene> levels , respectively ( see Figures 3A and 5A ) .	11	28	18	None
In this study , we used a group of cancer cell lines with either overexpressed or tyrosine kinase domain mutated ( ΔE746-A750 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) EGFR to assess their responsiveness <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib treatment and to evaluate HIF-1α as novel molecular marker for the therapeutic responses of the cancer cells to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> targeted therapy .	30 31	52	22 23	None
This year at ASCO , Tejpar et al. further supported this finding by presenting retrospective analyses of two large phase III multicenter trials ( CRYSTAL and OPUS ) representing 83 patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> KRAS mutant mCRC tumors who had longer overall survival and progression free survival on average post <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment then other KRAS mutant subtypes . Overall , these data suggest that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mAbs should still be considered as treatment options for patients with a G13D KRAS mutation , and that stratification of different KRAS mutant subtypes should now be documented .	49	63	32	None

Furthermore , De Roock and colleagues recently reported that chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancers harboring a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> KRAS mutation were more sensitive to treatment with the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> compared to tumors with other KRAS mutations [ ] .	31	25 26 27 28 29	15	None
Not all specific point mutations in KRAS may underlie the resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> monoclonal antibodies . De Roock et al. demonstrated in a pooled analysis of 579 patients compiled from seven clinical trials examining metastatic colorectal cancer patients , that patients overall with KRAS mutation had decreased survival but those with KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation had better overall survival and progression-free survival after treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> compared to other KRAS mutant tumors [ ] .	64	12	52	None
Notably , the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention ( EGAPP ) Working Group ( EWG ) found insufficient evidence to recommend or discourage testing for mutations in BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , NRAS , or PIK3CA and/or loss of PTEN or AKT protein . Therefore , the EWG discourages the use of these tests for deciding whether to introduce <ANNO_TYPE_gene> therapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab until more evidence supports improved clinical outcomes [ ] .	63	60	31	None
This <ANNO_TYPE_variant> allele mutation occurs in approximately 10 % of colorectal cancer patients . It is associated with microsatellite instability and poor survival of colon cancer patients. , BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer cause resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> targeted therapy with shorter PFS and OS compared to nonmutated patients . Remarkably , treatment with the BRAF-inhibitor sorafenib in in vitro experiments restored sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in colon cancer cells .	63	36	1	None
Which strategy is better in the management of advanced NSCLCs – the inhibition of mutated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation increases tyrosine kinase affinity for TKIs ) or a combined approach <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody ) plus first-line chemotherapy – is yet to be determined .	32 33	15	18 19	None
The KRAS status is the first molecular marker to predict the response to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> monoclonal antibodies <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab in metastatic CRC ( mCRC ) patients , and it needs to be determined before deciding in favor of treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies . Previous retrospective studies suggested that mt-BRAF was a marker of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and that the patients with mt-BRAF had significantly shorter PFS and OS than the patients with wt-BRAF tumours . The mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes have been reported to be mutually exclusive. , In the retrospective analysis by Fariña- Sarasqueta et al. , it was also shown that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was an independent prognostic factor for the survival of patients with colon cancer in stages II and III , while the KRAS mutations did not have any effect on the overall survival of these patients .	16	13	108 109	None
Other examples of useful biomarkers are KRAS mutation testing to predict benefit from monoclonal antibodies against <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab , in metastatic colon cancer [ ] and BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation analysis in metastatic melanoma in order to predict responsiveness to BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib [ ] .	18	16	30	None

In vivo experiments with CML xenografts in mice demonstrated that nilotinib treatment , compared with treatment with vehicle , improved survival of mice infused with either wild type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> or the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> Bcr-Abl mutant ( E255V ) ( ; ) .	40	37	0	None

The pattern of resistance to nilotinib and dasatinib differed ; those with greatest resistance to nilotinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and E255V ) were susceptible to dasatinib . T315I remained resistant to all the three drugs . In vivo experiments with CML xenografts in mice demonstrated that nilotinib treatment , compared with treatment with vehicle , improved survival of mice infused with either wild type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> or the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> Bcr-Abl mutant ( E255V ) ( ; ) .	66	63	17	None
In CML , this can result from further point mutations leading to additional changes in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , for example T315I , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and F255K . In GIST , secondary KIT mutations in exons 13 , 14 , or 17 other than exon 11 are reported to be important events in acquired <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance .	52	15	21	None

The capacity of ABL/BCR to autonomously induce leukemia suggests that the presence of p40ABL/BCR or p96ABL/BCR contributes to the maintenance of a leukemic subpopulation upon inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> by ATP-analogues such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , Dasatinib or Nilotinib , a scenario of particular importance in Ph+ ALL . One could speculate that the presence of ABL/BCR supports the proliferation of cells harboring BCR/ABL mutants with lower kinase activity , such as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , which boasts nearly complete resistance to small molecules – .	32	27	71	None
Results showed that ponatinib has the highest binding affinity towards the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with a docking score of −11.050 kcal/mol while bosutinib , bafetinib , dasatinib , nilotinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> showed −5.513 kcal/mol , −4.689 kcal/mol , −4.702 kcal/mol , −3.772 kcal/mol , −3.593 kcal/mol and −3.78 kcal/mol , respectively ( ) .	29 30	13	11	None
In a phase I clinical trial ponatinib was used to treat 67 patients resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib and nilotinib and passed safety requirements . Among these patients , 72 % presented mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> at the beginning of the study or had a documented mutation story , including the T315I and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations .	15	34	52	None
Our results with the mutants agree with Gontarewicz et al. , who reported that PHA-739358 was effective against imatinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants including those with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in human and mouse leukemia cell lines as well as in CD34+ cells from an <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CML patient [ ] .	42	19	25	None
Using this insight , new small-molecule inhibitors have been identified that retain activity against the majority of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants [ , ] . For example , in CML , a commonly found mutation is a C→T single nucleotide change that replaces threonine with isoleucine at position 315 ( T315I ) in the ABL kinase domain [ , , ] . In GIST and HES , respectively , the analogous <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in KIT and T674I mutation in PDGFR-alpha have been associated with acquired resistance to this drug [ , ] .	17	18	70	None
Similar to mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( T315I ) or in KIT ( T670I ) that underlie resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is thought to interfere with the binding of EGFR-TKIs at the adenosine triphosphate binding cleft of EGFR . , , On the other hand , the affinity of this cleft for adenosine triphosphate is increased by T790M .	18	4	20	None
The JAK2 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is thought to relieve the negative regulatory role of the dual-specificity kinase domain and is thus is weakly oncogenic , able to transform specific cell lines to cytokine independence . Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) is a Philadelphia chromosome positive MPN characterized by the presence of the t ( 9 ; 22 ) ( q34 ; q11 ) chromosomal translocation and the consequent expression of the BCR-ABL fusion protein . Treatment of CML was revolutionized in 2001 with the development of the small-molecule inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mesylate ( IM ) , , , which binds to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain and that prevents its ability to phosphorylate target substrates , .	89	101	2	None

Nilotinib markedly differs from imatinib in its interactions with the BCR-ABL protein , and is 30 times more potent than imatinib against the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in vitro activity in several Ph+ cell lines and is active against most <ANNO_TYPE_drug> BCR-ABL mutations , but not against the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , .	37	23	45	None
L1196M represents a mutation of the “gatekeeper” residue , similar to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gefitinib-resistance mutations observed in EGFR , and T315I mutations in ABL . Mutations in the gatekeeper site are thought to increase the affinity for ATP significantly , outcompeting the effects of ATP competitive inhibitors [ ] . The effect of the C1156Y mutation is unclear , although it may have an indirect effect on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding , and further studies will be required to establish its mechanism .

Consistent with this , we found that the introduction of R1275Q into <ANNO_TYPE_gene> had no negative impact on sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( IC50 47 ± 8 nm ) . As expected , the IC50 values for viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutants were all above that for Ba/F3 cells expressing native EML4-ALK , with IC50s ranging from 231 to 981 nm . The three most resistant mutants , L1196M , S1206R , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , all had IC50s within twofold of parental , ALK negative , Ba/F3 cells ( IC50 1176 nm ) .	20	12	74	None
For example , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , termed the ‘gatekeeper’ mutation , reduces the ability of EGFR inhibitors to outcompete ATP binding to EGFR . This mutation ( along with other far less frequent resistance associated mutations ) is found in cell line models of resistance and in approximately 50 % of patients who develop acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy , , . The analogous gatekeeper position on <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , L1196 , is similarly found to be mutated in ALK fusion positive lung cancer at the time of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and in resistant cell line models , as are several other amino acids for which mutation also reduces the ability of the drug to inhibit the kinase , , , , .	91	69	4	None
Two secondary mutations of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> associated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance – L1196M and C1156Y – were first detected in the same patient , who relapsed after achieving a partial response to the drug . The L1196M substitution occurs at the gatekeeper position of ALK ( a position that controls the binding of nucleotides and TKIs ) , and corresponds to the T790M substitution in EGFR and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution in the Bcr–Abl fusion protein , both of which confer resistance to corresponding TKIs .	7	4	66	None
There are several promising agents for patients with activating EGFR mutations who experience disease progression of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and have a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation , and multiple clinical trials will be available . Trials investigating adjuvant erlotinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC and comparing erlotinib to erlotinib plus bevacizumab in metastatic EGFR mutant NSCLC are ongoing . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , when compared to platinum pemetrexed , results in a superior ORR and progression-free survival in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> rearranged NSCLC , and ceritinib is a second-line option for this patient population , but patients need to be monitored closely for adverse events and the need for dose reductions .	59	78	24	None
In the case of melanoma , for example , a BRAF mutation test is used to determine if a BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation exists in the patient sample , and if present , that patient will receive a customized treatment with the drug Zelboraf , which is effective only for BRAFV600E positive melanomas . Nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients carrying an <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation are treated with the drug <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which is specific for this type of mutation , whereas NSCLC patients having an EGFR mutation would receive alternative customized treatments .	70	63	20	None
In lung cancers , ALK mutations appear to develop during clinical treatment with crizotinib and their generation probably renders EML4-ALK resistant not only to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> but also to other <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors . In our series , no ALK <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was observed .	24	29	38	None
Within the past few months , two targeted treatments have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) : vemurafenib ( RO5185426 , PLX4032 ) for the treatment of people with BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation positive metastatic malignant melanoma and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( PF-02341066 ) for the treatment of advanced <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	43	52 53 54 55	36	None
It inhibits both L1196M in ALK+ NSCLC and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR mutants . Phase I/II data for AP26113 have demonstrated efficacy in both <ANNO_TYPE_drug> naive and resistant patients . It also has the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and is active in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> brain metastasis .	24	44	9	None
In a melanoma study of 21 patients who received a sufficiently high dose of vemurafenib , 5 without the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutation did not respond to the drug ; however , of 16 patients with the mutation , 9 responded to vemurafenib and 7 did not [ ] . In a phase II study of imatinib for advanced melanoma , a substantial proportion of patients with tumors characterized by mutation or amplification of KIT responded to the drug whereas it had limited activity in a nonselected population of melanoma patients [ ] . Results of the CRYSTAL trial indicate that the clinical activity of cetuximab against metastatic colorectal cancer is enhanced in patients with wild-type KRAS compared with individuals having <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations , none of whom benefited from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment [ ] .	128	120	19	None

SSCP analysis indicated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> WT status , which qualified her ( the patient ) for concomitant targeted therapy ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> : first dose , 400 mg/m2 ; subsequent doses , 250 mg/m2 ) and chemotherapy ( 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 bolus and then 600 mg/m2 over 22 h for day 1 ; leucovorin 200 mg/m2 before 5-fluorouracil ) . After 4 months of treatment , stabilization of the metastatic lesions within the pelvis was observed , but two new metastatic lesions within the skin layers had occurred . Fine needle aspiration of the new metastatic lesions indicated adenocarcinomas , which were tested for KRAS and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutation using the real-time PCR method ( KRBR-RT50 , Entrogen ) .	19	3	104	None
Because mutations in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene result in activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway , only metastatic colorectal cancer patients with wild-type KRAS tumors qualify for anti-EGFR targeted therapies with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab [ ] . Also , a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor ( PLX4032 ) demonstrated antitumor activity in tumors with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and confirmed that V600E BRAF is a valid therapeutic target in human cancer [ ] .	34	4	60	None
The antibody <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which is directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) , provides survival advantage in the subgroup of patients carrying wild type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> alleles [ ] . The KRAS mutational status is predictive in terms of response to therapy with antibodies targeting the EGFR . In CRC , BRAF is mutated with a prevalence of 9.6 % [ ] and the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation accounts for more than 80 % of these mutation events , resulting in a hyperactivating substitution of valine600 by glutamic acid [ ] .	2	26	65	None
Mutations of BRAF , which encodes the cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase immediately downstream of RAS , are found in 4–13 % of advanced CRCs and are usually mutually exclusive with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations [ , ] . The BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation has been described as a predictor of tumor aggressiveness in metastatic disease [ , , ] and also of low RRs to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab [ , , , ] .	61	29	37	None

BRAF ( v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 ) , a serine/threonine kinase , is the downstream effector of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in the RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway . A somatic mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 15 of BRAF has been identified in multiple human cancers with a mutation rate of 66 % in malignant melanomas [ ] and at lower frequency in other human carcinomas . Recently , it was demonstrated that wildtype BRAF is required for the response of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab [ ] .	86	20	31	None
In this study , SW480 and HCT116 cells were more resistant to apoptosis when treated with regimens containing <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than when treated with regimens containing bevacizumab . This finding is related to the fact that both cell lines harbor a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation , with SW480 and HCT116 cells expressing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G13D KRAS mutants , respectively .	18	40	49	None
In the study by Pentheroudakis et al. , patients with a mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene who received chemotherapy combined with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> had a median overall survival of 19 months , whereas patients with other KRAS mutations and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> type gene subjects treated with the same modality had a considerably longer median survival of nearly 30 months [ – ] . Furthermore , there are many reports on patients with the wild-type KRAS gene who are refractory to anti-EGFR treatment . The cause of refractoriness has been identified in ca. 15 % of mCRC patients as mutations in the BRAF gene , primarily <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution .	24	41	106	None
It has been shown that higher levels of AREG and EREG have a positive predictive value in determining response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and when treated with cetuximab these tumors have better PFS [ ] . Although attempts at developing drugs targeting <ANNO_TYPE_gene> have largely been unsuccessful , several BRAF inhibitors have been discovered . Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets both wtBRAF and oncogenic BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and has in vitro activity in CRC cell lines with this mutation .	20	41	67	None
Other examples of useful biomarkers are <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation testing to predict benefit from monoclonal antibodies against EGFR , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab , in metastatic colon cancer [ ] and BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation analysis in metastatic melanoma in order to predict responsiveness to BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib [ ] .	18	6	30	None
Baseline <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation data were available for 95 % of patients . Very high <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance mutations ( M244V , G250E , Y253H , E255K , E255V , T315I , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , H396R ) were associated with the lowest response rates to dasatinib .	14	1	30	None
No differences in overall response rate were observed in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations at baseline , in particular for p-loop mutations . A subanalysis was conducted by Branford et al on the emergence of new detectable mutations in 479 patients treated with dasatinib after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> failure , and development of new mutations , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , F317L , and V299L , was rare ( 13 % ) .	44	11	54	None

Despite <ANNO_TYPE_drug> 's clinical success , resistance due to mutations and side effects are still a limitation of this drug . To overcome resistance , second generation TKI 's inhibitors , nilotinib and dasatinib were developed . However , neither compound effectively inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , which constitutes 20 % of all BCR-ABL mutations .	1	45	43	None
As shown in , DB07107 and DB06977 showed better docking scores than existing drugs while others showed results comparable to those of marketed drugs like ponatinib , bosutinib , bafetinib , dasatinib , nilotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . In the case of DB06977 , although one H_bond is missing ( Met318 ) with the wild-type of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> complex compared to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant type , it still exhibits a favorable binding score of −10.94 kcal/mol .	35	55	59	None

Furthermore , slow monophasic responders were more likely to be <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( as opposed to imatinib-intolerant ) and have nilotinib-insensitive mutations ( half maximal inhibitory concentration [ IC50 ] & gt ; 150 nm ; <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , E255V/K , F359V/C ) [ ] in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> at baseline ( Table ) .	10	44	35	None
Soon after the advent of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , it became evident that Philadelphia chromosome–positive cells could evolve to evade inhibition . In particular , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutant – the most commonly observed point mutation in clinical practice – confers universal resistance to these agents.– At present , the only TKI that is effective in patients with the T315I mutation is ponatinib ( ARIAD Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , Cambridge , MA , USA ) .	8	6	27	None
Of particular interest , 1R-Chl shows comparable anti-proliferative activity on BM cells transduced with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , which is resistant to the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and dasatinib treatment , compared to unmutated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	23	31	15	None
This phenomenon was initially observed in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> CML and GIST , where the respective targets , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and c-Kit acquired a mutation in a “gatekeeper” residue of the ATP binding pocket [ , ] . Likewise , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the EGFR gene rose after chronic exposure to Gefitinib in NSCLC , conferring resistance to this inhibitor [ ] .	6	16	38	None
This drug was designed as a specific inhibitor of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> oncogene protein tyrosine kinase , known to be responsible for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) cells [ ] . The therapeutic effectiveness of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and relative absence of detrimental side-effects has made it a model for the development of an array of new therapeutic agents targeted to inhibit signal transduction enzymes , especially protein kinases . The recent discovery that 60–70 % of human melanomas have activating mutations in B-Raf ( with 80 % of these mutations caused by a single <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) make this protein kinase an especially promising target for inhibition [ , ] .	35	10	93 94	None
A complete hematological response and a major cytogenetic response were observed broadly across the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants , including individuals harboring the dasatinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> Y253H , and F359C/I/V mutations , but not T315I .	25	14	22	None
Transformation to accelerated phase CML occurred in four third-line patients ( dasatinib-resistant , n = 3 ; <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , n = 1 ) and one fourth-line patient . Response rates were analyzed with respect to the mutational status of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . The most frequent BCR-ABL mutations at baseline were <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , T315I , G250E , and Y253H .	17	39	49	None

Ponatinib is the only available drug that is designed to overcome <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutation and is efficient in inhibiting the mutant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Ponatinib exhibits triple carbon-carbon ( ethynyl linkage ) bond between the methyl phenyl and purine groups . It holds the Isoleucine side chain without steric interference and without any loss of hydrogen bond ( H_bond ) . It also showed similar binding pattern ( DFG-out ) as imatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> which interacts with Met318 , Asp381 and the side chain of Glu286 .	71	21	11	None
To compare their efficacy and binding pattern with our screened compounds we again docked FDA approved drugs with wild-type of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . As shown in , DB07107 and DB06977 showed better docking scores than existing drugs while others showed results comparable to those of marketed drugs like ponatinib , bosutinib , bafetinib , dasatinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and imatinib . In the case of DB06977 , although one H_bond is missing ( Met318 ) with the wild-type of BCR-ABL complex compared to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant type , it still exhibits a favorable binding score of −10.94 kcal/mol .	55	20	81	None

Another possibility is that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> BRAFV600E mutants have alternative signaling at the level of Raf , as has been described for cell lines with acquired resistance to a different Raf-inhibitor , AZ628 , which show increased signaling through C-Raf [ ] . The increase in pErk in an NRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant cell line could be explained by abrogation of negative feedback loops mediated mainly by dual specificity phosphatases ( MKPs/DUSPs ) , as reported with Mek inhibitors [ , ] , and the recent description of increased C-Raf signaling when heterodimerizing with inhibited B-Raf in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> wild type cells [ , ] .	4	95	49	None

The first selective <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor to enter clinical trials was vemurafenib ( also designated <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , PLX4720 , and RG7204 ) . Vemurafenib was developed alongside a companion real-time polymerase chain reaction based assay ( cobas® 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test ; Roche Molecular Diagnostics , Inc , Pleasanton , CA ) designed to detect the BRAFV600E mutation . This test is highly sensitive and specific for the V600E BRAF mutation but is less so for other V600 BRAF mutations ( eg , V600K , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , V600D , or the 1799_1800TG & gt ; AA V600E mutation ) .–	14	3	85	None
Vemurafenib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) and dabrafenib ( GSK2118436 ) are approved for treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma ( Food and Drug Administration ) and vemurafenib is also approved by the European commission/European Medicines Agency . Both selectively inhibit the BRAF V600 mutated form of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , inhibit phosphorylation of ERK , and have high clinical response rates in melanoma patients ( Figure C ) ( , ) . It has been noted already in xenografts from BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant colorectal cancer cell lines that tumor growth inhibition was most efficient when vemurafenib was combined with EGRF or Akt inhibitors and/or chemotherapeutic agents ( ) .	2	45	78	None
The best validated targeted drugs in melanoma are the selective <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors vemurafenib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , Zelboraf™ ) and dabrafenib ( GSK2118436 , Tafinlar™ ) as well as the LGX818 ( Novartis ) compound that appears to have the highest affinity for the catalytic domain of the kinase .

Acquired resistance to IM mediated by the amplification and mutation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> presents a great challenge to the therapy of CML [ ] . New generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been designed ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib , sunitinib , ponatinib and GZD824 ) to overcome the acquired resistance to IM [ , ] . Although these novel inhibitors can effectively inhibit the phosphorylation of the mutated Bcr-Abl ( E255K , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , most of them had little effect on Bcr-Abl-T315I .	36	11	73	None
Additional inhibition of the upstream or downstream molecules of BCR-ABL might significantly enhance the effect of targeting <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ , - ] . These approaches may be potentially applied to targeting imatinib-resistant FIP1L1-PDGFRα . Several compounds have been reported to overcome the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] , EXEL-0862 [ ] , PKC412 ( midostaurin ) [ ] , sorafenib [ ] , ponatinib [ ] , and DCC-2036 [ ] in vitro .	47	17	42	None

This is due to point mutations in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain , including the most frequent T315I and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations [ , ,, ] . Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib and bosutinib are capable of targeting the majority of imatinib-resistant mutations , but none of them are effective against leukemia cells harboring the T315I mutation [ - ] .	32	8	18	None

The most common PDGFRA mutation , D842V in exon 18 , is resistant to imatinib. , , In contrast , the substitution <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 12 results in an isoform of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> that is highly sensitive to imatinib. , Lasota et al. and Heinrich et al. reported <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivities for a deletion/substitution ( SPDGHE566-571R ) and an in-frame insertion mutation ( ER561-562 ) in exon 12 .	47	31	22	None
Using this insight , new small-molecule inhibitors have been identified that retain activity against the majority of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> BCR-ABL mutants [ , ] .

More recently , this paradigm has been extended to treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Several mutations have been identified in the context of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with NSCLC that are associated with clinical response to the small-molecule EGFR inhibitors gefitinib ( Iressa ) or erlotinib ( Tarceva ) [ , , ] , including in-frame deletions such as del L747–E749 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 19 , or L858R in exon 21 .	3	29	124 125	None
Another approach for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance is the dual inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with afatinib and cetuximab , an EGFR blocking antibody resembling the synergistic combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and trastuzumab in ErbB2 positive breast cancer .	26	11	3	None

This study revealed that the quinazoline rings of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> interact differently with the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain , suggesting that while the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation may affect inhibition by erlotinib and gefitinib , it may not affect inhibition of EGFR by compounds similar to lapatinib .	10	15	23	None

EGFR TKI , which are effective for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of the EGFR gene , may also prove to be effective in patients with mutations in exon 20 of the HER2 gene , but only if they have the ability to block the function of the tyrosine kinase associated with both EGFR and HER2 . A double reversible inhibitor of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and HER2 receptors called <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has not shown efficacy in this case .	65	60	8	None
Garcia et al reported an association with response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and a polymorphism in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> exon 20 ( 2361 G &gt ; A , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	9	14	24	None
In vitro studies have shown that IC50 of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was less than 0.16 mol/L in A431 , HN5 , BT474 , N87 , and CaLu-3 cell lines , and was about 3 mol/L in MCF-7 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell lines . Compared to EGFR- or/and HER2 positive cell lines , breast cancer cells with low <ANNO_TYPE_gene> or/and HER2 expression had 25 times higher IC50 .	8	54	36	None
In a random mutagenesis based resistance screen , a number of potential secondary ErbB2 mutations , including mutations of the gatekeeper T798 residue were identified that might mediate acquired <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . T798I is analogous to the common gatekeeper mutations of EGFR and BCR-ABL , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and BCR-ABL <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	29	44	47	None
Another approach for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance is the dual inhibition of EGFR with afatinib and cetuximab , an EGFR blocking antibody resembling the synergistic combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and trastuzumab in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> positive breast cancer .	26	30	3	None
A randomized phase II study of WBRT with or without <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> breast cancer with brain metastases is ongoing ( NCT01622868 ) . Inhibitors targeting BRAF in melanoma Activating BRAF mutations that result in constitutive activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway affect approximately half of patients with melanoma , and more than 95 % of these are the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( substitution of valine by glutamic acid at the 600th amino acid position ) [ ] .	10	14	63	None
EGFR TKI , which are effective for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of the EGFR gene , may also prove to be effective in patients with mutations in exon 20 of the HER2 gene , but only if they have the ability to block the function of the tyrosine kinase associated with both EGFR and HER2 .

Compared to EGFR- or/and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> positive cell lines , breast cancer cells with low EGFR or/and HER2 expression had 25 times higher IC50 .	8	44	36	None
Afatinib is an irreversible <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor , with activity against wild-type and mutant forms of EGFR [ ] . Afatinib was more potent than gefitinib , erlotinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in inducing the cell death of NSCLC cell lines , including those harboring wild-type EGFR , and the erlotinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] .	29	4	49	None
In vitro analyses identified three point mutations , L755S , L755P , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> to confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Kancha et al. , ) . Threonine 798 is the ERBB2 “gatekeeper” residue that is located at the periphery of the nucleotide binding site of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase ( Aertgeerts et al. , ) , and regulates access to a deep hydrophobic pocket in the active site ( Schindler et al. , ) .	18	45	13	None
Such mutations rarely , if ever , accompany EGFR mutations and are associated with primary resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] . To evaluate the possibility that secondary <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations confer acquired resistance to these drugs , we performed mutational profiling of KRAS2 exon 2 from tumor specimens from patients 1 to 3 , as well as the three additional patients lacking evidence of the T790M mutation .

Such mutations rarely , if ever , accompany EGFR mutations and are associated with primary resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] . To evaluate the possibility that secondary <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations confer acquired resistance to these drugs , we performed mutational profiling of KRAS2 exon 2 from tumor specimens from patients 1 to 3 , as well as the three additional patients lacking evidence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	17	29	66	None
EGFR gene mutations indicate sensitivity to gefitinib , and it was demonstrated that about 85 % of patients with NSCLC who obtained benefit from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment were found to have mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene [ - ] . EGFR mutations in exon 19 ( short in-frame deletions ) or 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( point mutation ) affect the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain leading to the activation of 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds , which function to compete with ATP [ ] . Anti-EGFR therapy can consequently lead to the downregulation of downstream signaling cascades , such as the PI3K/Akt , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , MAPK , and STAT pathways , responsible for cell proliferation and survival , resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis , respectively .	24	114	61	None
Both the EGFR and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> genes predict the prognosis of NSCLC. , Exon 19 deletion mutation and a mutation in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) are the two main types of EGFR mutation . Riely et al found that patients with the EGFR exon 19 mutation had a longer median survival time than those with the EGFR exon 21 mutation after receiving <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib ( 34 versus 8 months , respectively ; P=0.01 , log-rank ) .	62	4	23	None

In lung cancer patients , EGFR mutations are generally exclusive with KRAS and BRAF mutations , and tumors with either <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( 15–25 % ) or BRAF ( 2-3 % ) mutations are relatively insensitive to EGFR TKIs [ , ] . The most common activating mutations ( ~90 % ) are in-frame deletions in exon 19 of EGFR and a missense mutation at 858 in exon 21 of EGFR resulting in an arginine to leucine substitution ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] . Therapeutic agents targeting the EGFR signaling pathway , including two EGFR kinase inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , are clinically effective in treating lung cancer patients harboring these EGFR activating mutations [ – ] .	96	20	78	None
In contrast to patients with EGFR‐mutation‐positive tumors , patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> NSCLC are unlikely to respond <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib and do not have an improved progression‐free survival ( PFS ) compared with those who have placebo following erlotinib therapy . Dacomitinib ( PF‐00299804 ) is a potent , irreversible , oral small‐molecule inhibitor of HER1/EGFR , HER2 , and HER4 tyrosine kinases with antitumor activity in both gefitinib‐sensitive and gefitinib‐resistant , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , preclinical NSCLC models .	16 17	10	73 74	None
Indeed , also the basal level of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> was higher in S3R than in S4 cells indicating p53 dependent apoptosis . It seems that DDR can be a culprit of cell senescence , therefore we wondered whether <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells would be able to senesce after treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	47	7	37	None
Although this cell line was responsive to low doses of the other drugs tested , the lack of activity of xanafide in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> could be , in part , due to its long doubling time . Furthermore , xanafide has proved to be more active than the taxanes , gemcitabine , vinorelbine and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in MCF-7 . These findings suggest a specificity of xanafide against the ER+ , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> w/t MCF-7 cell line .	54	69	23	None
When we investigated the response of p53 to DNA damaging reagent <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , a significantly decreased induction of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> expression and its transactivity toward downstream genes were found in NNK transformed cells , confirming the aberrant function of p53-R273H . Moreover , in addition to abrogating the tumor suppressor functions of wild-type TP53 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant has also been found to acquire new oncogenic activities to promote cancer , including metastasis promotion and increased resistance to anticancer treatments [ , ] .	11	18	54	None
We further analysed the effect of endogenous <ANNO_TYPE_gene> on DSC3 expression by treatment of CX-2 , WiDr , and HRT-18 with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ADR ) , an inducer of endogenous p53 expression . Induction of p53 mRNA expression was achieved in the three cell lines by ADR modification with different concentrations ( Supplementary Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , while increased expression of p53 was only observed in the cell line HRT-18 ( Figure S2B ) but not in the p53-mutant cell lines CX-2 and WiDr ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) .	21	7	54	None
Although Daoy cells harbor a p53 homozygote mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , they retain a 22,8 % <ANNO_TYPE_gene> promoter-specific transcriptional activity , as measured in yeast functional assays on WAF1 ( expressed as percent of wild-type activity ; see additionally the data from a p53 database available at “http : //www-p53.iarc.fr/” ) , because of these reported data we <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> stimulation may be due in Daoy cells to an enhancement of miR34a transcription .	59 60	17	9	None
We next tested the expression of Pint in different mouse cell types at different time points after induction of p53 by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced DNA damage , including p53+/+ and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> MEFs ( Figure ) , and K-RAS lung tumor and sarcoma cells ( Figure ; see Additional file : Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) after genetic restoration of the p53 gene [ ] .	21	29	50	None
Because mutations in the KRAS gene result in activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway , only metastatic colorectal cancer patients with wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tumors qualify for anti-EGFR targeted therapies with cetuximab or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . Also , a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor ( PLX4032 ) demonstrated antitumor activity in tumors with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and confirmed that V600E BRAF is a valid therapeutic target in human cancer [ ] .	36	26	60	None
Likewise , codon 61 has been included in many diagnostic tests because the KRAS mutation in codon 61 predicts resistance to cetuximab plus irinotecan in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> codon 12 and 13 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer [ ] . Moreover , the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the BRAF gene is more and more frequently taken into consideration before patient targeted therapy qualification , because wild-type BRAF is required for a response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or cetuximab [ , ] .	72	25	43	None
Regarding KRAS , the same group reported in a pooled dataset of 579 cetuximab treated CRC patients that those with codon 13 KRAS mutant tumours ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) had better outcomes ( HR for death 0.50 ) compared to patients with other KRAS mutant tumours [ ] . Those findings stood in our Greek population cohort , as the median survival of our cetuximab treated patients seemed to de-escalate from 29–33 months for KRAS wild type to 28 months for the KRAS codon 13 mutated group , dropping to 19 months for the KRAS codon 12 mutated group . Although Peeters et al. recently failed to find a prognostic difference between codon 12 and codon 13 <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations in CRC patients managed with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in three randomised trials , another group from Germany did so for cetuximab [ , , ] .	123	116	26	None
On the other hand , a number of studies have demonstrated no benefit for either cetuximab or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by specific <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations . Although the preclinical work delineating different KRAS mutations is promising , prospective , multicenter clinical studies are required to recruit the numbers of patients necessary for the validation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and other mutations in KRAS as positive biomarkers of response to EGFR targeted therapies .	17	20	52	None
On the contrary , the mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 2 has been associated with better response to EGFR antibodies than other KRAS mutations , but the data are mixed. , In addition to the exon 2 KRAS mutation , other mutations such as KRAS mutation exons 3–4 and NRAS mutation exons 2–4 have also emerged to be clinically relevant biomarkers of a lack of response to EGFR antibodies . For example , treating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tumor patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> may even have a detrimental effect on survival as shown in the Panitumumab Randomized Trial in Combination With Chemotherapy for Metastatic CRC to Determine Efficacy ( PRIME ) study , where patients were randomized to first-line chemotherapy with or without panitumumab .	77	73	6	None
In 2009 , the FDA updated the product labels for cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , indicating that patients with CRC tumours harbouring <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations were unlikely to derive benefit from these therapies . However , these guidelines may have to be re-visited , as it has been shown ( in one study ) that patients with a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation showed improved survival compared to patients with other mutations , indicating that this patient group may respond to therapy [ ] .	12	21	56	None
BCR-ABL1 positive and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> B-ALL Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) targeting mutant ABL1 have revolutionized treatment of Ph+ leukemias in adults and children , resistance mutations are a known sequelae of TKI therapy that often result in eventual treatment failure . One study recently demonstrated improved growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis when sirolimus was added to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> Ph+ ALL cell lines harboring an acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation ( ) .	59	3	67	None
Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor , can undergo relapse due to the acquisition of a secondary mutation within the Abl coding sequence , that renders imatinib ineffective . Similarly , EGFR TKI responsive patients acquire secondary mutations , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in the ATP binding cleft , which increases EGFR affinity for ATP ( reviewed in ) .	9	12	47	None
Similar to mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( T315I ) or in KIT ( T670I ) that underlie resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is thought to interfere with the binding of EGFR-TKIs at the adenosine triphosphate binding cleft of EGFR . , , On the other hand , the affinity of this cleft for adenosine triphosphate is increased by T790M .	18	4	20	None
In these CML-BC patients , imatinib resistance often depends on reactivation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase activity via mechanisms involving BCR/ABL overexpression , gene amplification or mutations that suppress imatinib mediated kinase inhibition ( i.e. E255V and G250E ) or disrupt <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding ( i.e. <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( ) .	40	12	44	None
NVP-BEZ235 has been evaluated also in a mouse model consisting of BA/F3 cells overexpressing either WT BCR-ABL or its <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants ( E255K and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] .	19	20	25	None
Cell lines harboring a mutant KIT , FLT3 or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> were sequence confirmed . The gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell lines GIST822 , harboring a KIT exon 13 mutation ( K642E ) , and GIST48 , harboring an imatinib-sensitive <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation plus a secondary <ANNO_TYPE_drug> activation loop mutation ( D820A ) were generously provided by Dr. Kopp ( University of Tübingen ) [ , ] .	43	9	38	None
Two secondary mutations of ALK associated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and C1156Y – were first detected in the same patient , who relapsed after achieving a partial response to the drug . The L1196M substitution occurs at the gatekeeper position of ALK ( a position that controls the binding of nucleotides and TKIs ) , and corresponds to the T790M substitution in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and the T315I substitution in the Bcr–Abl fusion protein , both of which confer resistance to corresponding TKIs .	7	63	9 10	None

Later rechallenge with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI may result in some modest degree of response ( range 4–24 % ) and a significant disease control rate ( range 45–67 % ) . Resistance mechanisms to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are multiple , and include ALK-dominant mechanisms such as resistance mutations and copy number gain , and ALK non-dominant mechanisms through the outgrowth of clones containing a separate activated oncogene . In contrast to the EGFR setting , where the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation predominates , the spectrum of ALK resistance mutations is broad .	33	3	74	None

In our patient , a somatic MET amplification was identified by genomic profiling , and the patient experienced a durable response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , all without knowledge of the site of tumor origin . Similarly , another CUP patient was identified as harboring a somatic EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> alteration via hotspot testing and responded to gefitinib , an <ANNO_TYPE_gene> targeted therapy [ ] .	22	57	46	None
Resistance to tyrosine inhibitors invariably develops , and usually involves development of a gatekeeper mutation in the kinase domain , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in chronic myelogenous leukemia , and T790M in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutated NSCLC . Similarly , a patient developed resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> after 5 months of treatment and molecular analyses revealed the resistant tumor harbored two acquired but independent mutations within the kinase domain of EML4-ALK , C1156Y , and the gatekeeper mutation L1196M .	42	31	22	None
Unfortunately , more than half of patients with MET gene amplification also presented the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the EGFR gene . Despite the lack of unequivocal efficacy , simultaneous inhibition of c-MET and EGFR function seems to be an attractive alternative therapeutic option in resistance to reversible EGFR TKI . There are ongoing second and third phase trials of the c-MET inhibitors tivantinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , used together with erlotinib in patients previously untreated with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI or in case of progression after successful monotherapy with erlotinib [ , – ] .	64	75	14	None
MCF10a cells containing the PI3K mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> showed little sensitivity to single agent sirolimus , and in combination with EGFR inhibitors were still seen to be more resistant than their parental counterpart , and were more resistant than MCF10a cells containing the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> E545K mutation . Chou and Talalay combination indices for each cell line examined Gefitinib + ZSTK474 Erlotinib + ZSTK474 Gefitinib + Rapamycin Erlotinib + Rapamycin Gefitinib + ZSTK474 Erlotinib + ZSTK474 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> + Rapamycin Erlotinib + Rapamycin	74	42	6	None
Cells with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and E545K showed greatest single agent sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor . Interestingly , cells with these mutations also showed greater sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib than cells with the EGFR mutation ( exon 19 deletion ) , which are associated with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC .	28	2	4	None
Although MET amplification can coexist with the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , approximately 60 % of MET amplification is independent of T790M mutation [ , ] . MET amplification was originally identified in a laboratory-model of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance using HCC827 human EGFR mutant NSCLC cells . In this model , cells with EGFR TKI resistance relied on MET signaling to activate AKT through ERBB3 mediated activation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in the presence of EGFR TKIs [ ] .	35	66	8	None
In clinical studies of metastatic colon cancer , patients with wild type K-ras , B-raf and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> genes gain benefit from cetuximab therapy [ ] , whilst lung cancer patients with mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene benefit from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or Tarceva therapy . These findings suggest that gene mutation ( s ) may play a key role in resistance to Trastuzumab treatment . After screening for EGFR , K-ras , B-raf and PIK3CA gene mutations in the 5 PDECX mouse models and their corresponding primary tumors , we found that model EC039 ( and the corresponding patient tissue ) had a helical domain mutation ( G1624A , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene ( Figure and Table ) .	43	16	112	None
However , it was demonstrated recently that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> increased the affinity of ATP to the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain ; thus , it decreased the binding of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , because they are ATP-competitive agents [ ] . Other acquired resistance mechanisms , such as small cell transformation , MET amplification , epithelial-mesenchymal transition and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation , were found in small series of patients [ , ,, ] .	27	56	7	None
While the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation represents a direct mechanism for drug resistance that occurs at the level of drug accessibility to the target , there are a number of indirect mechanisms that involve the increased expression or activation of alternative growth factor receptors to maintain signal flux , despite EGFR inhibition . Perhaps the best characterized of these is the amplification of the Met receptor and/or elevated levels of its ligand HGF . In <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant NSCLC cell lines , Met drives ErbB3 dependent activation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway .	73	86	2	None

Mutations in exon 2 of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> occur in about one-fourth of NSCLCs . Such mutations rarely , if ever , accompany EGFR mutations and are associated with primary resistance to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .

In contrast to patients with EGFR‐mutation‐positive tumors , patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> NSCLC are unlikely to respond to gefitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and do not have an improved progression‐free survival ( PFS ) compared with those who have placebo following erlotinib therapy . Dacomitinib ( PF‐00299804 ) is a potent , irreversible , oral small‐molecule inhibitor of HER1/EGFR , HER2 , and HER4 tyrosine kinases with antitumor activity in both gefitinib‐sensitive and gefitinib‐resistant , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , preclinical NSCLC models .	18 19	10	73 74	None
Wild‐type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> NSCLC was either directly confirmed ( n = 54 ) or assumed from a known EGFR mutation ( n = 12 ; EGFR mutation status was known for a total of 26 patients ) . Mutation and gene amplification data were collected from EGFR and HER2 according to availability of sufficient tissue for analysis ( Table ) . Six patients had EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation identified after treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Supporting Table ; see online supporting information ) .	71	1	64	None
Specific genetic alterations of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , BRAF , PIK3CA , ALK and , more recently , ROS and RET have been described in well defined subsets of NSCLC. , , , These lesions represent ‘driver mutations ' , as lung cancers depend on their constitutive activation. , Thus , molecular screening of NSCLC is mandatory to guide the most appropriate therapies ( that is , small molecule kinase inhibitors ) . , Cancers harboring the same genetic alterations , however , respond differently to molecular targeted therapies , suggesting coexisting mutations or coactivation of other TKs . Finally , although molecularly targeted therapies ( that is , gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for EGFR and crizotinib for ALK fusions ) are effective in NSCLC , intrinsic or acquired resistances inevitably lead to recurrence and/or metastatic dissemination . This is the case of MET activation/amplification , , or acquired somatic mutations of EGFR ( T790M ) or ALK fusions ( G1269A , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and ALK amplification ) . , ,	109	4	159	None
Although several previous studies have suggested that tumors harboring mutations in the EGFR kinase domain were sensitive to TKIs such as gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , others had reported an association between the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 20 and the resistance to TKIs . As we learn more about the relationship between EGFR status ( including gene copy number , mutation status , and mutation type ) and drug sensitivity , decisions about treatment with TKIs for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) become more complex . Previously , we reported HER2 mutational status , as well as EGFR and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , in a large number of NSCLCs .	23	101	32	None
However , it is unknown whether the status of EGFR mutation and downstream resistance related genes aberrances ( i.e. , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , or c-MET amplification ) are consistent in pre- and post-chemotherapy samples . Therefore , it is necessary to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on tumor molecular profiles . Chin et al reported that prior exposure to platinum agents may reduce the benefit from subsequent treatment with EGFR-TKI for an <ANNO_TYPE_drug> EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT survival pathway .	74	20	23	None
The second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors , dasatinib and nilotinib , can circumvent most mutations that confer resistance to imatinib ; the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , however , causes resistance to all <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase inhibitors developed so far . Similarly , the T790M point mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) confers resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer .	59	29	20	None
The second-generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors , dasatinib and nilotinib , can circumvent most mutations that confer resistance to imatinib ; the T315I mutation , however , causes resistance to all BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors developed so far . Similarly , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) confers resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer .	59	2	39	None
The L747S mutation lies at the start of the β3 strand and the α-C-helix [ ] and has analogous residues in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( L237M ) and ERBB2 ( L755S or P ) that have been identified in TKI resistant disease [ ] . The occurrence of these secondary mutations spurred development of second and third generation irreversible TKIs which bind covalently to the cysteinyl-797 residue in the pocket of the EGFR-kinase domain and overcome resistance driven by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] . These agents show greater potency in the inhibition of kinase activity in vitro and in vivo compared to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and are in various stages of clinical testing [ , ] .	101	21	78	None
For tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) [ ] , mutations within the ATP pocket of the kinase domain may affect the interaction of the drug with its target : for example , the single amino acid mutation tyrosine/methionine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR mediates secondary resistance to the EGFR TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ , ] . The T790M mutation in EGFR is structurally analogous to drug resistance mutations in other kinases such as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( T315I ) , c-KIT ( T670I ) and platelet derived growth factor receptor-α ( PDGFRα ) ( T674I ) [ ] .	57	89	40	None
A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment and in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( T315I ) following imatinib .	62	66	59	None
It was initially proposed that the T790M mutation might prevent the proper binding of tyrosine kinase inhibitors via steric hindrance , similar to the corresponding gatekeeper mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( T315I ) and KIT ( T670I ) that confer resistance to imatinib ( Gleevec ) in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors . Interestingly , it was discovered that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation does not confer resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by preventing their binding as originally thought .	73	28	64	None
In contrast , a helical domain mutant ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) enhanced transformation without inducing Heregulin expression [ ] . Therefore , in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> subtype breast cancers with PIK3CAH1047R or other kinase domain mutant alleles , therapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> together with an antibody that blocks Heregulin could be particularly effective .	37	22	8	None
Also , in MCF10A cells expressing high levels of HER2/Neu , a kinase domain mutant of PIK3CA ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) induced expression of Heregulin , the ligand that activates HER2/HER3 signaling through the PI3K pathway [ ] . In contrast , a helical domain mutant ( E545K ) enhanced transformation without inducing Heregulin expression [ ] . Therefore , in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> subtype breast cancers with PIK3CAH1047R or other kinase domain mutant alleles , therapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> together with an antibody that blocks Heregulin could be particularly effective .	75	60	18	None
Indeed , it markedly reduced EGF induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in A431 cells , but in Caski and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells the reduction was more modest ( 60 and 20 % inhibition , respectively ; ) , suggesting that persistent signalling through these pathways led to increased survival of Caski and C33A cells , when compared to A431 cells in the presence of cetuximab . Cetuximab combined with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> synergistically reduces cell proliferation and activation of downstream signalling pathways in CC cells We speculated that cells expressing higher <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ratios , such as A431 cells , rely more on EGFR signalling for MAPK pathway activation and cell proliferation , whereas cells with a lower EGFR/HER2 ratio , such as C33A cells , depend more on EGFR/HER2 heterodimer signalling .	66	86	17	None
Examples of this are <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> over expressing or amplified breast and gastric cancer , , imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma with ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) B-RAF mutations and crizotinib for non-small cell lung cancer patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements , .	4	6	32	None
The <ANNO_TYPE_gene> antibody <ANNO_TYPE_drug> blocked TGF-β induced motility but not Smad dependent reporter activity .

A complete hematological response and a major cytogenetic response were observed broadly across the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants , including individuals harboring the dasatinib-resistant F317L , the nilotinib-resistant Y253H , and F359C/I/V mutations , but not T315I . Nine individuals developed new mutations in the course of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment ( V299L , n = 4 ; L248V , n = 2 ; <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , n = 2 ; F359C , n = 1 ; G250E , n = 1 ) and eight of these individuals discontinued bosutinib because of progressive disease or unsatisfactory response .	45	14	60	None
In murine myeloid cell lines , bosutinib demonstrated inhibition against 16 of 18 imatinib-resistant forms of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Specifically , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> did not inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and V299L mutations ( Pfizer , 2012 ) .	19	16	23	None
Hematologic and cytogenetic responses to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were observed in patients with mutations within the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain except for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	5	14	20	None
Later generation inhibitors such as nilotinib , dasatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> overcome some of the resistance created by the majority of the mutations . Both dasatinib and nilotinib exhibit higher binding affinity for the ATP-site and can overcome all but the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutation , . In addition , other new ATP-competitive inhibitors capable of inhibiting T315I <ANNO_TYPE_gene> have been reported in conjunction with co-crystal structures : PPY-A , SGX393 , and PHA-739358 , AP24163 , DSA series compounds , HG-7-85-01 and AP24534 ; see also .	9	56	40	None
Results showed that ponatinib has the highest binding affinity towards the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with a docking score of −11.050 kcal/mol <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , bafetinib , dasatinib , nilotinib and imatinib showed −5.513 kcal/mol , −4.689 kcal/mol , −4.702 kcal/mol , −3.772 kcal/mol , −3.593 kcal/mol and −3.78 kcal/mol , respectively ( ) .	21 22	13	11	None
Preclinical activity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has been reported against most IM-resistant mutants of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with the exception of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and V299L. ,	3	12	17	None
In patients receiving 8 mg of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , a reduction of 50 % or more in CrkL phosphorylation was observed in four of six patients ( 67 % ) . At doses of 15 mg or more , 32 of 34 patients ( 94 % ) had a reduction of 50 % or more in p CrkL , and this included eight of ten patients ( 80 % ) with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . This trial provided valuable evidence of ponatinib’s direct kinase inhibiting activity in patients with a variety of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations , including the T315I mutant , leading to further evaluation of its effects .	6	91	71	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibited native ABL with an IC50 of 0.37 nM and clinically relevant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , G252H , T253P , M351T , and H396A with IC50 values of 2.0 nM , 0.44 nM , 0.30 nM , 0.30 nM , and 0.35 nM , respectively .	0	13	15	None
In summary , preclinical data supports the conclusion that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is an orally active , pan-TKI that inhibits native BCR-ABL and most <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants , including the clinically relevant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , with high potency .	9	22	29	None
While the first and second-generation TKIs have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients with CML and Ph+ ALL , resistance still occurs in a subset of patients who harbor <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations , particularly the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant . Until the recent approval of ponatinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , ARIAD Pharmaceuticals , Cambridge , MA , USA ) , there were no approved therapies for patients who had developed resistance , refractoriness , or intolerance to commercially available TKIs .	43	28	33	None
Ponatinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) is a novel pan–BCR-ABL inhibitor developed using a computational and structure based approach.– It was designed to bind to and inhibit native <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and BCR-ABL mutants that can arise during treatment with other TKIs and cause resistance , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	2	26	43 44	None
Gatekeeper mutants ( e.g. T315I <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , T670I KIT and T674I PDGFRα ) are particularly multi-drug resistant . In the present study , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> potently inhibited the phosphorylation of the WT and gatekeeper mutant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα and their downstream signaling .	23	5	34	None
