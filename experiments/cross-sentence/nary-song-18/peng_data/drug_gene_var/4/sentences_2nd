We show here that tumors with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations are inhibited in their proliferation by belinostat or 17-DMAG . Furthermore , the combination of both of these compounds synergistically inhibits growth of these tumors . The growth inhibitory effects of either belinostat or 17-DMAG were independent of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutational status of the cells ( p = 0.2323 , p = 0.4455 , respectively ) ( Supplement Fig. 1B , C ) ; thus , their inhibitory activities were quite different from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	81	47	6	resistance or non-response

Initial clinical studies found that only a minority of individuals with NSCLC responded to either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] . Asian non smoking females were noted to be particularly sensitive to this class of drugs [ , ] .

Activating mutations such as exon 21 missense point mutation L858R and in-frame deletions in exon 19 are the most commonly studied predictive biomarkers of response to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib ) , . Development of resistance to TKI is a thorny problem in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treatment . Despite the initial promising response to EGFR-TKIs in majority of NSCLC patients harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations , , most patients eventually relapse due to the emergence of acquired resistance such as the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or MET amplification , both accounting for about 70 % of the acquired resistance .	28	26	86	resistance or non-response

In patients with the non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) , the assessment of mutations in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain may be used as a predictive biomarker . It has been proved that somatic mutations in exons 19 or 21 are related to tumor sensitivity to therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib . A higher median survival rate was observed in the case of exon deletion in exon 19 than in the case of the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 [ ] .	56	17	84	sensitivity
miR-128b loss-of-heterozygosity has been found in NSCLC patients and has been shown to be positively correlated with clinical response and survival following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment ( ) .

An activating mutation in the activation loop of the EGFR kinase domain , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( also identified as Leu834 in a different numbering of the EGFR sequence ) is among most frequent mutations in lung cancer , amounting to more than 40 % of EGFR mutations in this cancer category – .	8	2	60	sensitivity

To further explore the role of AXL in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI acquired resistance we next focused on the novel in vitro models of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> acquired resistance that we generated in conjunction with the in vivo tumor xenograft models . Each of these cell lines was also resistant to the irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitor BIBW2992 ( afatinib ) ( ) . Thus resistance in these cellular models is unlikely a consequence of the secondary drug resistance mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in EGFR and is generalizable to distinct classes of EGFR TKIs .	22	8	76	resistance or non-response
To test this hypothesis and to clinically validate our preclinical findings , we measured the expression of AXL by IHC ( immunohistochemistry ) in 35 matched <ANNO_TYPE_gene> NSCLC specimens obtained from patients both prior to treatment with the EGFR TKIs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib and upon the development of EGFR TKI acquired resistance .

To identify genes that were differentially regulated ( threshold 3-fold change , FDR & lt ; 0.1 ) in the context of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> acquired resistance , we profiled the ER1-3 sublines as compared to parental HCC827 cells by genome-wide microarrays ( ) and validated our findings by Q RT PCR and western blots in all 5 sublines .	72	34	4	resistance or non-response

Dacomitinib ( PF-00299804 ) is another irreversible TKI able to target the activity of all HER TKs and has shown activity in NSCLC cell lines harbouring the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation7 .

Poziotinib ( also known as HM781-36B ) , a new potent irreversible inhibitor of EGFR , HER2 , HER4 , and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood family of kinases inhibitor ( BTK , BLK , and BMX ) , demonstrated preclinical efficacy against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant at eightfold lower doses compared to afatinib . A different approach in addressing EGFR-TKI resistance involves the use of combination regimens . Therefore , the combination of erlotinib with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and the combination of erlotinib with MM-121 ( a fully human mAb that targets HER3 ) , in patients with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> did not show sufficient clinical activity for further investigation in this population .	73	98	42	response

Mutations in the gatekeeper site are thought to increase the affinity for ATP significantly , outcompeting the effects of ATP competitive inhibitors [ ] . The effect of the C1156Y mutation is unclear , although it may have an indirect effect on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding , and further studies will be required to establish its mechanism . A number of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors that are able to inhibit ALK variants with “gatekeeper” mutations at L1196M have been developed .	67	84	0	 resistance

For example , KIT exon 9 mutations and exon 11 deletions involving codons 557–558 are associated with poor outcome , and the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is associated with resistance <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , , – ] .	29 30	22	23 24	resistance or non-response
In clinical studies of metastatic colon cancer , patients with wild type K-ras , B-raf and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> genes gain benefit from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy [ ] , whilst lung cancer patients with mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene benefit from Iressa or Tarceva therapy . These findings suggest that gene mutation ( s ) may play a key role in resistance to Trastuzumab treatment . After screening for EGFR , K-ras , B-raf and PIK3CA gene mutations in the 5 PDECX mouse models and their corresponding primary tumors , we found that model EC039 ( and the corresponding patient tissue ) had a helical domain mutation ( G1624A , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene ( Figure and Table ) .	21	16	112	resistance or non-response
These cells lines are different in K-RAS and B-RAF pathways , as HT-29 harbors the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> B-Raf heterozygotic mutation [ ] , SW-480 which harbors K-Ras mutation and Caco-2 is K-Ras and B-Raf wild type . The association between the expression of TAp73 and the presence/absence of K-Ras and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations in response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> supports their possible apoptotic function and helps to understand the action mechanism of this drug .	54	49	15	resistance or non-response

Indeed , from three sporadic mCRC retrospective studies – , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation has been shown to identify a subgroup ( & lt ; 10 % ) of patients that not only present resistance to anti-EGFR MoAbs therapy , but , is also characterized by particularly unfavorable prognosis regardless of treatment administration – . Furthermore , although not entirely clear yet , PIK3CA-mutant tumors seem to derive no or little benefit from anti-EGFR MoAbs treatment , – . Besides the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutational status , EGFR epiregulin (EREG) and ampiregulin (AREG) ligands ' expression in primary CRC tumours has been shown to significantly predict clinical outcome in KRAS WT mCRC patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , indicating ligand-driven autocrine oncogenic EGFR signaling , .	113	81	11 12	resistance or non-response

The results of a small study of 74 patients , conducted by Loupakis with his colleagues , suggested that rare KRAS mutations in codon 61 and in codon 146 might also be responsible for in the treatment resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. , In contrast , in their large retrospective analysis , De Roock et al. concluded that the codon 146 mutations did not affect the response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and that the patients with codon 61 mutant tumours had lower response rate . According to the analysis of other mutations , they proposed testing of KRAS status , if not mutated , then of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and NRAS status , and PIK3CA exon 20 mutation in order to improve the objective response up to 40 % in selected patients . In our retrospective study , 26.7 % of patients , all with KRAS wild-type tumours , who had previously unresectable liver-only metastases , underwent surgical resection after systemic therapy , with R0 resection achieved in 38 patients ( 21.6 % ) ; one of those was patient with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	68	104	179	resistance or non-response
The KRAS status is the first molecular marker to predict the response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab in metastatic CRC ( mCRC ) patients , and it needs to be determined before deciding in favor of treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies . Previous retrospective studies suggested that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> was a marker of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and that the patients with mt-BRAF had significantly shorter PFS and OS than the patients with wt-BRAF tumours . The mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes have been reported to be mutually exclusive. , In the retrospective analysis by Fariña- Sarasqueta et al. , it was also shown that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was an independent prognostic factor for the survival of patients with colon cancer in stages II and III , while the KRAS mutations did not have any effect on the overall survival of these patients .	16	48	108 109	resistance or non-response

Mutations in the proto-oncogene BRAF are present in 5 % –10 % of the metastatic CRC population and are also mutually exclusive of KRAS mutations . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is the most common of all BRAF mutations ( present in 90 % of cases ) , and is enriched in a subset of patients who are female , greater than 70 years of age , with KRAS WT right sided colon cancer . This mutation leads to constitutive activation of B-Raf by mimicking a tyrosine-kinase phosphorylation . Emerging evidence from the CRYSTAL , OPUS , and PICCOLO trials supports the use of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations as negative predictors of response to such EGFR inhibitors as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab. , , Objective response rates are significantly higher in the WT group , from 17 % to 47 % compared to 0 % –8 % in the BRAF mutant group .	113	101	26 27	resistance or non-response

Again , the differential sensitivity of the cell lines to the combination mimicked their sensitivity to TKI alone : the cell lines that demonstrated the most sensitivity to siRNA had the largest effect from the combination , including the cell lines with downstream TKI-resistance mutations ( which also in this context displayed the highest sensitivity ) or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .

By contrast , the third-generation inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( AP24534 ) , specifically developed to combat the gatekeeper mutant , not only affected the interaction of the native BCR-ABL with HSP90 but also of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> variant with the gatekeeper mutation .	52	80	23	response

Bosutinib effectively targets most IM-resistance conferring <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations , with the exception of the highly resistant T315I ( resistant to IM , dasatinib , nilotinib , and bosutinib ) and V299L mutations ( resistant to dasatinib and bosutinib ) . For patients who do not respond to first- or second-generation TKIs , allogeneic stem cell transplantation and interferon therapy are currently the only approved treatment modalities with the potential for life prolongation . It has been speculated that a growing selection pressure in TKI treatment will promote the appearance of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations.– Novel compounds such as the aurora kinase inhibitors – including danusertib ( formerly PHA-739358 ) , homoharringtonine , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> – successfully target the T315I mutation .	110 111	6	90	response

An illustrative historic example is that in chronic myelogenous leukemia which is initially sensitive to treatment with imatinib mesylate ( targets the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) treatment resistance may emerge due to the acquisition of secondary mutations in BCR-ABL that are resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> but that are sensitive to second generation BCR-ABL inhibitors such as dasatinib or nilotinib . Nilotinib and dasatinib are effective in nearly all such cases with the exception of cases that acquire the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	41	22	75	None

In this phase III trial , 345 patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation positive advanced NSCLC were randomized to receive afatinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as first-line therapy .

Y253H , E255K , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> were deemed less sensitive , but not inherently resistant , as was the T315I identified in three patients receiving nilotinib . Six of 16 imatinib treated patients ( 38 % ) with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations progressed to accelerated phase/blast crisis CML , as compared with 1/13 ( 8 % ) of nilotinib treated patients .

In contrast to patients with EGFR‐mutation‐positive tumors , patients with KRAS‐mutant NSCLC are unlikely to respond <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib and do not have an improved progression‐free survival ( PFS ) compared with those who have placebo following erlotinib therapy . Dacomitinib ( PF‐00299804 ) is a potent , irreversible , oral small‐molecule inhibitor of HER1/EGFR , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and HER4 tyrosine kinases with antitumor activity in both gefitinib‐sensitive and gefitinib‐resistant , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , preclinical NSCLC models .	16 17	57	73 74	None
The second-generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors , dasatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , can circumvent most mutations that confer resistance to imatinib ; the T315I mutation , however , causes resistance to all BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors developed so far .

To illustrate the inhibitory activities of BGT226 , BKM120 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> on PI3K pathway signaling , the phosphorylation levels of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( p-Akt ) and S6 ( p-S6 ) were assessed by western blotting in MDA-MB-231 , MCF7 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , or HCC712 cell lines in the presence of increasing dose of drug .	10	20	39	None
Although the resistant cell line HCG827GR does not have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , it was found to have MET amplification . MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is associated with the development of various human cancers . Therefore , EGFR-TKIs fail to inhibit the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway dependent growth signal because the constitutive phosphorylation of HER3 by MET occurs independent of EGFR activation , which causes the cells to acquire resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	53	11	None

Overcoming both losses of an active-site hydrogen bond and the steric hindrance caused by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation were the main focus during the design process of ponatinib . While still binding to the kinase active site of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , the overall design of the ponatinib molecule was still based on the ATP-mimetic template provided by the previous TKIs imatinib , nilotinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	63	37	15	None
The three types of cells showed different signaling dynamics in response to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> stimulation . Overexpression of wild type EGFR induced high and sustained phosphorylation of EGFR , Shc , MEK ( mitogen activated protein kinase kinase ) and ERK ( extracellular signal regulated kinase ) , while the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation reduced these response levels . In addition , H1299L858R , which is supposed to be more sensitive to gefitinib than H1299EGFR-WT , was effectively inhibited by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> administration at the downstream part of the signaling pathway ( MEK and ERK ) compared with H1299EGFR-WT , but , surprisingly , not at the upstream part of the pathway ( EGFR and Shc ) .	77	12	49	None

In fact , the V299L mutation was later detected in this patient and might explain this clinical course , as this mutation confers a poorer efficacy for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . The outcome of patient 3 , who developed a systemic relapse with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and F317L mutations also demonstrates the possibility of evolving resistant mutations under constant selective pressure of long lasting TKI treatment . Based on our data , switching therapy to a different 2nd generation TKI in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> CNS disease should be strongly considered if the patient fails to respond , a strategy that has been proven effective in systemic treatment [ ] .	27	79	43	None
Dasatinib binds multiple conformations of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] , unlike imatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] .

In the case of DB06977 , although one H_bond is missing ( Met318 ) with the wild-type of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> complex compared to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant type , it still exhibits a favorable binding score of −10.94 kcal/mol .	33	55	59	None

Indeed , even if the co-existence of KRAS and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations could be interpreted as double mutation occurring in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> tumor cells , the possibility of different tumor clones with activation of EGFR and KRAS signaling as different mechanisms of crizotinib-resistance appeared to be an alternative , perhaps more likely explanation . Furthermore , the identified <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutation , although not reported before , was located near mutations known to be sensitive to EGFR-TKI , such as L858R and L861X .	20	9	57	None
Similarly , the co-existence of KRAS and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations in the same tumor tissue could be interpreted as either double mutation in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> tumor cells or more likely as the occurrence of two different tumor subpopulations with constitutive activation of either the EGFR or the KRAS signaling pathway as different mechanisms of acquired crizotinib-resistance . Neither of these 2 scenarios could be excluded by the methods used in our molecular analysis . The EGFR mutation L862R has to our knowledge not previously been described in the literature , but given its proximity to mutations known to be sensitive to EGFR-TKI ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L861X ) , tumor clones bearing the L862R mutation could also be potentially responsive to EGFR-TKI .	23	7	102	None
This is analogous to the EGFR T790M mutation in the ATP biding pocket of the EGFR , which is the most common mechanism of resistance in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutated lung cancer ( ) . Tissue analysis of harvested tumor cells from patients resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has demonstrated other non-gatekeeper secondary mutations in the ALK TK receptor . ALK secondary mutations in NSCLC are distributed throughout the kinase domain , including the solvent front ( G1202R , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , ATP binding pocket ( G1269A ) , and N-terminal to the C-helix ( 1151Tins , F1174L , L1152R , and C1156Y ) ( , – ) .	43	26	75	None

Further , they represented a SQCLC patient with a wild type EGFR who showed radiological response after treatment with both dasatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in their clinical trial .

In the randomized open-label phase III CALGB 40502/NCCTG <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , the new and expensive BC treatments , nanoparticle albumin bound nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane ) and ixabepilone , the latter being a potent epothilone that can be effective after microtubule inhibitor resistance ( Ixempra ) , have failed to demonstrate any superior efficacy versus the standard of weekly <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in combination with bevacizumab in patients with chemotherapy naïve metastatic BC .	87	0	38	None
LY294002 , a specific inhibitor of the p110 catalytic subunit of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] , and Wortmannin [ ] , a cell-permeable , irreversible inhibitor of PI3K , were purchased from Calbiochem ( San Diego , CA ) . 2.2. Cell Lines and Treatments The human ovarian A2780 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> parental cancer cell line ( designated <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , provided by Dr. J. Rebecca Liu ( University of Michigan Medical School , Ann Arbor , MI ) , was originally established from an untreated ovarian cancer patient [ ] .	48	11	55	None
It could be therefore be assumed that because <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations drive HER related receptor addiction in these cells it would make them more susceptible to RTK inhibition ( as seen here with gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) ( Figure ) . Cells containing the PIK3CA mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> were found to be more sensitive than those with the PIK3CA mutation H1047R , suggesting that not all activating mutations found within a given gene will result in the same activity to targeted therapy .	34	8	45	None
MCF10a cells containing the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> showed little sensitivity to single agent sirolimus , and in combination with EGFR inhibitors were still seen to be more resistant than their parental counterpart , and were more resistant than MCF10a cells containing the PIK3CA E545K mutation . Chou and Talalay combination indices for each cell line examined Gefitinib + ZSTK474 Erlotinib + ZSTK474 Gefitinib + Rapamycin Erlotinib + Rapamycin Gefitinib + ZSTK474 Erlotinib + ZSTK474 Gefitinib + Rapamycin <ANNO_TYPE_drug> + Rapamycin	77	4	6	None

Interestingly , cells with these mutations also showed greater sensitivity to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than cells with the EGFR mutation ( exon 19 deletion ) , which are associated with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC . Mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) have been shown to enhance HER2 mediated transformation by amplifying the ligand induced signaling output of the HER family of RTKs [ ] .	13	39	41	None
In contrast , we have demonstrated that the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and PD153035 ( a specific EGFR TKI ) proved to be antagonistic in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell line , with no reduction in proliferation and EGFR , HER2 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and MAPK phosphorylation status when compared to either drug alone [ ] .	10	38	24	None
Previously , we demonstrated that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells do not rely on EGFR signaling to proliferate and that cetuximab has no effect upon EGFR , HER2 , AKT and MAPK phosphorylation status , and even the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035 , did not display enhanced toxicity when compared to either agent alone [ ] . As <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway activation leads to cell survival [ ] , we evaluated whether the combination of matuzumab and LY294002 was able to induce apoptosis , which would explain the synergistic effect of these drugs observed in A431 and CASKI cell lines .	37	61	5	None
Some MEK1 mutations , including the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation identified in a patient 's AZD6244-resistant melanoma , also led to cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors , presumably by causing activation of MEK downstream of BRAF . Interestingly , later work by this same group identified a different MEK1 point mutation ( C121S ) in a post-relapse biopsy from a patient with clinically acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , demonstrating that MEK1 mutations can arise as a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors as well [ ] .	66	82	6	None
At this time , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> showed a progression of the disease in the cervical , mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes . Carboplatin was discontinued and PLD was initiated as a second-line chemotherapy . For the first cycle , a total of 85 mg ( 40 mg/m2 ) of liposomal <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in 250 ml of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( 5 % glucose solution ) was prescribed with the same premedications used for the prior carboplatin .	49	4	54	None

SSCP analysis indicated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> WT status , which qualified her ( the patient ) for concomitant targeted therapy ( cetuximab : first dose , 400 mg/m2 ; subsequent doses , 250 mg/m2 ) and chemotherapy ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> 400 mg/m2 bolus and then 600 mg/m2 over 22 h for day 1 ; leucovorin 200 mg/m2 before 5-fluorouracil ) . After 4 months of treatment , stabilization of the metastatic lesions within the pelvis was observed , but two new metastatic lesions within the skin layers had occurred . Fine needle aspiration of the new metastatic lesions indicated adenocarcinomas , which were tested for KRAS and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutation using the real-time PCR method ( KRBR-RT50 , Entrogen ) .	36	3	104	None
SSCP analysis indicated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> WT status , which qualified him for concomitant targeted therapy ( cetuximab : first dose , 400 mg/m2 day 1 ; subsequent doses : 250 mg/m2 ) and chemotherapy ( irinotecan 180 mg/m2 day 1 , 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 bolus and then 2,400 mg/m2 over 48 h ; leucovorin 200 mg/m2 before <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) . At first , partial remission was observed , but therapy was stopped after seven cycles due to clinical and radiological progression of the disease . As further genetic analysis showed , the patient did not have mutations in KRAS ( codons 12 , 13 , and 61 ) or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF .	56	3	108	None
This findings show that EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is a common resistance mechanism to both reversible , and when amplified , the irreversible EGFR inhibitors . In our case , the response duration of irreversible EGFR inhibitor was 11 months which was unusually longer than those of initial <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( for 4 months ) and second round gefitinib ( for 6 months ) treatments . Recently an alternative approach is to develop novel strategies , instead of irreversible EGFR inhibitors , to inhibit EGFR and/or EGFR signaling , including the use of inhibitors of HSP90 and/or EGFR downstream signaling ( such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors ) as these resistant cancers still remain dependent on EGFR signaling for their growth .	46	103	5	None
Meanwhile , it is important to emphasize that preclinical studies have evidenced that RET activating mutations at codon 804 ( V804L , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) cause resistance to some TKIs , such as vandetanib . Cabozantinib ( XL184 ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is a potent inhibitor of MET , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and RET .	38	46	22	None
Although <ANNO_TYPE_variant> Thr389 phosphorylation was observed in cells cultured in the medium of BCAA_1 through BCAA_5 , the phosphorylation levels were maximum in BCAA_3 and the phosphorylation was suppressed by rapamycin , suggesting that mTORC1 was activated under these conditions and had the highest activity in BCAA_3 medium . Although p21 protein was detected in cells cultured by BCAA_1 through BCAA_5 , because p21 is a DNA damage responsive gene , the protein level of p21 in BCAA_3 medium was higher than that in other BCAA medium . Furthermore , p21 protein was markedly decreased in the presence of rapamycin even in the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , indicating that the expression level of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> was regulated through the mTORC1 pathway .	105	113	1	None
As shown in Figure , BaF3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL were highly sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib and ponatinib , whereas <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and BaF3-G250E-BCR-ABL cells were resistant to both imatinib and dasatinib . By contrast , ponatinib induced loss of cell viability in BaF3 cells carrying the T315I or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , in agreement with previous results from the literature [ , ] .	14	21	49	None
At the same time , the backbone NH of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> forms an HB interaction with the side chain carboxylate of the PKA residue Glu170 ; this interaction is conserved when Arg19 is changed by other amino acids in all the studied mutants . shows that the side chain groups of the mutated residues Lys and the protonated <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at position 19 of the WT substrate ( in mutants <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and R19Hp ) also form HB interactions with the side chain carboxylate group of the PKA residue Glu170 , while the mutated residue histidine δ at the same position 19 ( in mutant R19Hδ ) also forms an HB interaction with the side chain carboxylate group of the PKA residue Glu203 ( ) .	57	9	68	None

Overexpression of wild type EGFR induced high and sustained phosphorylation of EGFR , Shc , MEK ( mitogen activated protein kinase kinase ) and ERK ( extracellular signal regulated kinase ) , while the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation reduced these response levels . In addition , H1299L858R , which is supposed to be more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than H1299EGFR-WT , was effectively inhibited by gefitinib administration at the downstream part of the signaling pathway ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and ERK ) compared with H1299EGFR-WT , but , surprisingly , not at the upstream part of the pathway ( EGFR and Shc ) .	54	73	34	None
To examine whether ponatinib is active against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα , we exposed <ANNO_TYPE_gene> FIP1L1-PDGFRα cells to ponatinib , sorafenib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( the latter two serving as positive and negative controls , respectively ) ; levels of phosphorylated and total PDGFRα were measured by immunoblotting .	19 20	12	7	None
In summary , preclinical data supports the conclusion that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is an orally active , pan-TKI that inhibits native BCR-ABL and most <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants , including the clinically relevant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , with high potency .	9	22	29	None
While the first and second-generation TKIs have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients with CML and Ph+ ALL , resistance still occurs in a subset of patients who harbor <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations , particularly the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .

If <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is well tolerated , assessing its response rate and durability in treatment-naïve chronic phase CML and Ph +ve patients will be of great interest . DCC-2036 , an allosteric inhibitor of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and omacetaxine , are being investigated in phase 1/2 studies for similar purposes.

Using a representative cohort of 229 sporadic CRCs , we identified the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation as an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with advanced and recurrent CRC . The presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation is associated with a significantly higher risk of dying of cancer related causes , independently of other factors such as age , gender , PS , KRAS status , pathological finding , number of metastasis and metastatic sites , in agreement with other recent studies ( ; ; ; ) . However , our study focused on the advanced and recurrent group who received systemic chemotherapy , including fluoropyrimidines , in combination with oxaliplatin , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , bevacizumab and anti-EGFR antibody in several lines .	111	34	13	None
Similarly , tumour response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> may be influenced by polymorphisms in genes involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway ( ; ) . These include polymorphisms in codon 118 ( AAC to AAT ) of the excision repair cross complementing group 1 ( ERCC1 ) gene and codon 399 ( CGG to CAG ) of the X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 ( XRCC1 ) . The aim of this study was to evaluate three genetic alterations ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation , Kras mutation and MSI ) and three polymorphisms ( MTHFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , ERCC1-118 and XRCC1-399 ) for their ability to predict response and toxicity to FOLFOX first line chemotherapy in the treatment of mCRC .	5	79	92	None
The Phe382 from the DFG motif undergoes conformational changes with most mutations in particular ; the P-loop residues ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and E255V ) and the activation loop residue H396P .

Ponatinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) is a novel pan–BCR-ABL inhibitor developed using a computational and structure based approach.– It was designed to bind to and inhibit native <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and BCR-ABL mutants that can arise during treatment with other TKIs and cause resistance , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	2	26	43 44	None

These findings suggest that the effect of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> consumption on serum TC and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> levels may depend on the PCSK9 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> genotypes .	7	13	20	None
We further addressed whether the expression level of miR-524-5p is affected by inhibiting hyperactivation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway . We used either the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor PD325901 or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to block highly activated BRAF signaling in SK-Mel-19 or A375 cells .	31	16	28	None
Following SDS–PAGE of lysates , immunoblotting studies with specific antibodies for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , caspase-9 , caspase-3 , Apaf-1 , Bcl-xl , and β-actin were performed as described in Materials and methods ( * ) : caspase-3 cleaved products ; ( ** ) : Bcl-xl cleaved products . Each lane was loaded with 30 μg of protein .

In lung cancer patients , EGFR mutations are generally exclusive with KRAS and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations , and tumors with either KRAS ( 15–25 % ) or BRAF ( 2-3 % ) mutations are relatively insensitive to EGFR TKIs [ , ] . The most common activating mutations ( ~90 % ) are in-frame deletions in exon 19 of EGFR and a missense mutation at 858 in exon 21 of EGFR resulting in an arginine to leucine substitution ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ ] . Therapeutic agents targeting the EGFR signaling pathway , including two EGFR kinase inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , are clinically effective in treating lung cancer patients harboring these EGFR activating mutations [ – ] .	96	13	78	None

It would be interesting to study in the future if <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , MECP2 , LSD1 or other yet-to-be identified REST interactors are involved .

Based on the current in-vitro findings , it may be worth moving forward in the clinic with several drug combinations to prevent drug resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which would include drugs targeting ERK , or with drugs targeting <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . While these findings were consistently observed in the A375 cell line , future studies are indicated to explore other <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutant bearing cell lines to compare and contrast with the results for A375 cells .	25	38	59	None
Second , along the same line of inquiry , unlike <ANNO_TYPE_drug> which is preferentially active in tumor cells bearing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of BRAF , reducing levels of pERK1 and/or 2 does not depend on the mutation status of the melanoma cell . Indeed , it has been observed that within melanoma lesions , there can be both clones containing both BRAF mutant alleles as well as wild-type BRAF [ ] . Third , by silencing ERK1 and/or ERK2 , the feedback loop between ERK and RAF and MEK is interrupted as clearly observed by comparing treatment of cells with MEK inhibitor which led to increased phospho-MEK as reported by others [ ] , in contrast to the decrease in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> after our shRNA approach ( see below for more discussion ) .	10	120	20	None
In this report we also demonstrated that Dasatinib , an Abl/Src dual inhibitor , is capable of cooperating with GNF-2 in inhibiting the proliferation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells carrying the native or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated Bcr-Abl . In fact , our data showed that the cooperation with Dasatinib was more potent than the one observed with Imatinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	57	25	32	None

Additionally , the levels of p-AKT and p-ERK 1/2 were not suppressed by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> alone in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> transduced OE19 , consistent with our hypothesis that constitutive Src activation might sustain both downstream signalling pathways .	13	17	18	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> transduced OE19 developed lapatinib resistance ( IC50 to the lapatinib , 1179.0 nM ) , while GFP or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> wild-type transduced OE19 remained sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( IC50 to the lapatinib , 256.6 nM and 313.8 nM , respectively , ) .	26	19	0	None
The <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations are considered catalytic as they directly affect the configuration of the enzymatic site probably by stabilizing the A-loop extended conformation – . To this category belongs the mutation of D in position 816 ( indicated as a black sphere on ) , most frequently substituted by V , found in most patients with mastocytosis , leukemia and germ cell tumors . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is also resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Gleevec™ ) treatment , which has motivated to study its role in KIT activation mechanisms .	69	1	64	None
Resistance mutations identified via in vitro screens have shown a high degree of correlation with those that develop in vivo , as shown in screens for imatinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants [ ] and PKC412-resistant FLT3 mutants [ ] , as well as the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the context of EGFR [ ] .	46	27	42	None
Conversely to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , ponatinib was found to induce apoptosis in all three imatinib-resistant cells lines , even though sensitivity to ponatinib was lower in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and LamaR cells as compared to JURLMK1R cells . Apoptosis induction by ponatinib was confirmed by <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cleavage in each sensitive and resistant cell lines ( Figure ) .	2	42	25	None
Our analysis of the clinical specimens shows that AXL upregulation is the second most common mechanism of EGFR TKI acquired resistance ( after EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs that has been validated using primary human data . Importantly , we found upregulation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in patients that developed resistance to both EGFR TKIs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib ) that are clinically approved for use in NSCLC patients worldwide .	55	44	24	None
We next asked whether ( 1 ) forced expression of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> is sufficient to induce erlotinib resistance and ( 2 ) whether AXL kinase activity is necessary for the induction of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance by AXL . To address these questions , we generated cDNA constructs that encode either wild type ( WT ) AXL or a kinase impaired mutant of AXL in which a key conserved lysine within the kinase domain was changed to arginine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	31	10	76	None

These results were recently confirmed in a larger Phase II study including 449 mostly heavily pretreated chronic phase , accelerated phase , and blast crisis CML patients , as well as patients with Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia with and without the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . A decreased incidence of progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis has been reported for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , dasatinib , and nilotinib when compared with imatinib in upfront therapy , even though these differences have only been reported to be statistically significant in the case of nilotinib to date .

Disruption of the microtubule network by chemical agents , such as nocodazole and colchicine , leads to ligand independent <ANNO_TYPE_gene> nuclear accumulation and transcription of TGF-β-responsive genes . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is an anticancer agent which , by stabilizing polymerized microtubules and maintaining microtubular assembly , arrests the cell cycle in the G0–G1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> phases and induces cell death , .	28	19	51 52	None
For example , a multitude of studies have focused on the relationship between ERCC1 and ERCC2 polymorphisms and the prognostics for the treatment with platinum agents in colorectal cancer patients , and the meta-analyses of these data found that two SNPs in ERCC1 and ERCC2 might be useful prognostic factors for assessing clinical outcomes of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based chemotherapies in colorectal cancer . The mutations or polymorphisms of these two genes could alter DNA repair capacity , so it was biologically plausible to assume that the ERCC1 and ERCC2 polymorphisms might have functional significance in colorectal cancer . The present study investigated the associations of the ERCC1 Asn118Asn , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , ERCC2 <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and Lys751Gln polymorphisms with risk of colorectal cancer in the Chinese population .	55	111	108	None

Again , the activity of this resistance mechanism could be suppressed through combined MET and BRAF or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibition . Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and Wnt pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of everolimus . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( T315I ) following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	146	17	134	None

Based on our data , we hypothesized that PRR of hnRNP L binds to PTB and cooperatively suppresses inclusion of exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .

Thus , while flow cytometric analysis suggests no transport of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or rhodamine 123 in cells transfected with wild-type ABCG2 , cross-resistance studies do suggest that wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> confers a very low level of resistance to these two compounds . All three ABCG2 proteins conferred low levels of resistance to etoposide , while no appreciable resistance to paclitaxel , depsipeptide or flavopiridol was noted . Mutations at amino-acid 482 have included <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and R482T in human cancer cells ; R482S and R482M in mouse fibroblast lines ( ; ) ; and a recently reported R482M mutation in a doxorubicin selected human T-cell line ( ) .	10	27	71	None

There are suggestions that certain mutations ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) do not confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , though these observations need to be confirmed by prospective trials and were not replicated in analysis of a recent panitumumab trial [ , ] .	16	9	9	None
H1975 cells harbor two mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T790M ) in the EGFR gene . All cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated fetal calf serum ( FCS , JRH Biosciences , Lenexa , Kansas ) .

To prepare the mutants , we mutated arginines of the WT sequence inside the transformed PKA model and obtained the models that contain <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and the peptides LARASLG ( R18A ) , LRAASLG ( R19A ) , LKRASLG ( R18K ) , LRKASLG ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , LHRASLG ( R18H ) , and LRHASLG ( R19H ) . We also prepared the models including the shorter chain peptides RRASLG , RASLG , and LRRASL . For the mutants that contain <ANNO_TYPE_drug> we prepared the models containing neutral histidine with the hydrogen atoms at position δ or ε ( Hδ and Hε ) , and the models containing the protonated histidine Hp ( see the next section ) .	80	23	44	None
For the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> phenotype , either the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or E465K unc-18 mutations increased sensitivity .

Although this hypothesis has not been directly tested for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> specifically , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> hypomorphs in C. elegans do have reduced sensitivity to volatile anaesthetics [ ] emphasizing a potential convergence of cellular effectors of various anaesthetics at the presynaptic terminal . On the other hand , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation acts to increase Rab3 binding , at least for Munc18 [ ] .	9	12	47	None

Second , along the same line of inquiry , unlike <ANNO_TYPE_drug> which is preferentially active in tumor cells bearing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of BRAF , reducing levels of pERK1 and/or 2 does not depend on the mutation status of the melanoma cell . Indeed , it has been observed that within melanoma lesions , there can be both clones containing both BRAF mutant alleles as well as wild-type BRAF [ ] . Third , by silencing ERK1 and/or ERK2 , the feedback loop between ERK and RAF and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> is interrupted as clearly observed by comparing treatment of cells with MEK inhibitor which led to increased phospho-MEK as reported by others [ ] , in contrast to the decrease in phospho-MEK after our shRNA approach ( see below for more discussion ) .	10	88	20	None
In addition , the IC50 values for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were 0.5 to 30nM in parental cells and 30 to more than 300nM in resistant cells . As a whole our findings confirmed the efficacy of ponatinib on the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , but also highlighted the notion that ponatinib is effective on all types of imatinib-resistant CML cells , whatever their mode of resistance . Importantly , the IC50 values obtained for ponatinib in the present study for BaF3-WT-BCR-ABL , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and BaF3-G250E-BCR-ABL ( 1nM , 8nM and 8nM respectively ) were very similar to the one reported previously by O’ Hare et al.

<ANNO_TYPE_variant> family members play an important role in the control of gene expression in several phases of the cell cycle and in multiple checkpoints . Their targets are diverse and cover genes controlling DNA replication and G1/S transitions , such as Cyclin A/E , Cdc6 , and Mcms , as well as products involved in DNA repair and G2/M transitions , such as Cdc25a , Cdk1 , Aurora-A and Survivin [ ] . In our previous study , E2F3 is also found to be a direct target of miR-200b , and inhibition of miR-200b , which led to E2F3 overexpression , contributed to resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] ( ) .	109	0	0	None
Kastl et al. reported that reduced cyclin D1 expression modulated by miR-34a could induce G1 phase arrest , where docetaxel exerts little cytotoxicity , in turn leading to the resistance of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in breast cancer cells [ ] . Cyclin D1 is also a target of let-7i , and a chimera that combines Mucin 1 (MUC1) aptamer and let-7i miRNA was proved to reverse paclitaxel resistance in EOC cells through down-regulation of cyclin D1 , cyclin D2 , Dicer 1 , and PGRMC1 expressions [ ] . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family members play an important role in the control of gene expression in several phases of the cell cycle and in multiple checkpoints .	31	87	87	None
More than 50 % of metastatic melanoma tumors harbor an activating mutation in codon 600 of the BRAF gene ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or , to a lesser extent , V600K ) ( Davies et al. , ) . Recently , selective BRAF inhibitors such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( vemurafenib ) and GSK2118436 ( dabrafenib ) have shown clinical efficacy in BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma patients ( Flaherty et al. , ) with significant tumor regression in approximately 60 % of patients ( Flaherty et al. , ) . Clinical trials using BRAF inhibitors to treat patients with melanoma <ANNO_TYPE_gene> were initiated recently with promising results despite the small sample size .	44	96	20	None
Since the 5-year survival rate drops dramatically following breast cancer metastasis to distal organs such as bone , liver and brain , it is of special importance to investigate whether <ANNO_TYPE_variant> could increase the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy drugs against metastasized breast cancer cells , especially brain metastasized breast cancer cells . Brain metastasis is observed in approximately 10 % of breast cancer patients , and recurrence is common due to reduced efficiency of chemotherapy drugs , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and carboplatin , and targeted therapy drugs , such as trastuzumab , to cross the blood-brain barrier , . A very recent study showed that the binding of S1P to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in brain capillaries decreases basal P-glycoprotein transport activity and improves the delivery of therapeutic agents like paclitaxel to the brain .	79	110	30	None
Several studies have reported renal failure and tumor lysis syndrome during TKI based molecular targeted therapies , including with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma , with imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia , and with flavopiridol for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.– Because <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant of ABCG2/BCRP corresponding to SNP 421C&gt ; A reduces uric acid transport and those TKIs are substrates/inhibitors of ABCG2/BCRP , TKI therapy in patients with the SNP 421C&gt ; A ( Q141K ) may be at higher risk of tumor lysis syndrome . A defect in the pharmacological interaction has been suggested between <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and another ABCG2/BCRP germ-line mutant allele , 1291T & gt ; C. Remarkably , sunitinib reversed wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mediated drug resistance and competitively inhibited ABCG2/BCRP mediated estrone 3-sulfate transport and the binding of 125I-iodoarylazidoprazosin to ABCG2/BCRP .	95	113	39 40	None
Similar results were found in another clinical trial with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at the same doses . Of the 15 patients with disseminated MTC treated for up to 12 months , four patients had SD over 24 months . A recent study compared the effect of four TKIs ( axitinib , sunitinib , vandetanib , and XL184 ) on cell proliferation , RET autophosphorylation , and extracellular signal regulated kinase activation in three cell lines : MZ-CRC-1 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> RET mutation ) , MTC-TT ( C634W RET mutation ) , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( RET/PTC-1 rearrangement ) cells .	9	89	76	None
Based on our data , we hypothesized that PRR of hnRNP L binds to PTB and cooperatively suppresses inclusion of exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .

The differences in the parameters were confined to specific steps and proteins - EGFR overexpression , inhibitory effects caused by Mig6 , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> overexpression leading to the degradation of EGFR . Our results revealed that the effectiveness of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in cells is largely affected by not only on its direct binding affinity with EGFR but also on the presence of an additional molecule , Mig6 . According to recent reports , the sensitivity to kinase inhibition reflects intrinsic differences in the binding affinity of the EGFR mutants such as L858R , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and exon19 deletions [ , - ] .	39	23	92	None
The results indicate that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A , including Mig6 , successfully reproduced the inhibitory effect for ERK at higher concentrations of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , whereas model B , which included the effect of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , failed to reproduce this response .	23	34	5	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity phenotypes of single point mutations in unc-18 We recently demonstrated that a single point mutation ( D216N ) in Munc18 acts biochemically by reducing binding to the assembled SNARE complex and that the orthologous mutation in C. elegans unc-18 ( D214N ) reduces sensitivity to both low and high concentrations of exogenous ethanol [ ] . Previously , we have biochemically characterised other point mutations in Munc18 that affect binding to other proteins including R39C ( inhibits binding to closed-conformation syntaxin ) [ , ] , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( inhibits binding to Mint proteins ) [ ] and E466K ( enhances binding to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) [ ] .	0	104	88	None

Additionally , we have used the Baf3 Bcr-Abl <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell line , derived from <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( an immortalized murine pro-B cell line ) , which is also resistant to 1μM imatinib and at least partially resistant to dasatinib and nilotinib treatments ( -6 ) . In addition to its effect on imatinib-sensitive cell lines , the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> regimen was able to induce caspase cleavage , a measure of caspase activation [ - ] , in K562-R cells and significant downregulation of the total levels and phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl in all tested TKIs-resistant cell lines .	56	14	8	None

We here found for the first time that co-treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> synergistically induced apoptosis in human colon cancer HT-29 cells by simultaneously inhibiting the phosphorylation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and progression of the autophagic process .	12	28	10	None
Since mTOR is another downstream effector of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , we further investigated phosphorylated mTOR expression by western blotting .

For example , it has been shown that targeting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptors could dampen etoposide mediated CLL cell death [ ] , while enhancing the effects of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , lenalidomide , bortezomib , and doxorubicin on multiple myeloma [ ] . Thus , targeting ectonucleotidase activity seems to be more appropriate . Inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activity by polyoxometalate-1 ( POM-1 ) , a pharmacologic inhibitor of nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase activity , abrogated melanoma tumor growth in wild-type mice but not in CD39-null animals indicating a specific effect of POM-1 on host CD39 [ ] .	26	53	9	None
To our knowledge , no NSCLC patient who initially responded to but then progressed on either gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has yet been treated with lapatinib . In some of the patient specimens analyzed , the actual sequencing peaks demonstrating the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation were smaller than originally anticipated .

In GIST and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , respectively , the analogous T670I mutation in KIT and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in PDGFR-alpha have been associated with acquired resistance to this drug [ , ] . To determine whether lung cancers that acquire clinical resistance to either gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> display additional mutations in the EGFR kinase domain , we have examined the status of EGFR exons 18 to 24 in tumors from five patients who initially responded but subsequently progressed while on these drugs .	44	3	14	None
The Mayo Clinic also confirmed the presence of t ( 9 ; 22 ) ( q34 ; q11.2 ) through chromosomal analysis for which RT-PCR verified the fusion of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> indicating the presence of early CML. Additionally , the Mayo reported the presence of a JAK2 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , providing confirmation for the coexistence of an early myeloproliferative disorder .

Because tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib was effective for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation cells , we also compared the inhibitory effect of DCC-2036 with sorafenib in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells .	8	26	9 10	None
Indeed , a Par-4 cleaved form was previously reported in human cells during Fas- or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced apoptosis. , Thus , phosphorylation by CK2 on residues S124 and S223 results in loss of rat Par-4 proapoptotic properties and prevents the generation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mediated cleaved form of Par-4 . We then examined whether Par-4 cleavage was regulated by phosphorylation of S124 by CK2 . We first performed an in vitro caspase assay using purified wild-type Par-4 or its mutants ( S124A , S124D , S223A , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , S124A , S223A or S124D/S223D ) in the presence of recombinant caspases .	15	43	87	None
The expression analysis of this response shows that both elicitors stimulated the expression of PAL , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , 4CL and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> independently of the anthocyanins/isoflavonoids ( CHS ) and lignins ( CCR ) pathways and therefore both induce stilbene biosynthetic genes in a highly specific way , in agreement to results reported by Saigne-Soulard et al. [ ] . Furthermore , the synergistic interaction of both elicitors on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> production ( Figure ) seems to be the result of their synergistic effect on the expression of biosynthetic genes ( Figure ) .	68	20	16	None
CDK1/2 inhibitors inhibit this interaction and cause <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated transcriptional downregulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 . CDK1/2 inhibition may also prevent their phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins . Alternatively , use of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , a proteasomal inhibitor , can inhibit HR function and potentially sensitize cyclin E1-dependent tumors to platinum based chemotherapy .	37	7	7	None
Cyclin D1 , in association with cyclin dependent kinase-4 and -6 , induces the cell to enter the S phase by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressing protein , which binds to transcription factors , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . In addition to the overexpression of cyclin D1 , other genes that overexpress in MCL , such as VEGF and Raf-1 , represent further possible targets for mTOR inhibitors . Indeed , a constitutive activation of Akt and mTOR pathways either in MCL cell lines ( Granta 519 , Jeko-1 , and SP-53 ) or in primary cultures from 30 % of MCL patients has been reported. , Moreover , mTOR inhibitors in MCL could synergize with other “canonical” agents , such as vincristine <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , bortezomib , and rituximab , with resulting inhibition of Raf-1 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and mTOR . ,	121 122	135	35	None

<ANNO_TYPE_variant> and B , it is likely that inhibition of LPA-LPA1 signalling does not affect hBMSC extravasation , but prevents differentiation of hBMSCs into myofibroblasts along with the secretion of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . Furthermore , Antalpa1 attenuated the injury induced by BLM in SCID/Beige mice lung significantly either 7 or 14 days after injection ( data not shown ) . Antalpa1 reduces hBMSC differentiation into myofibroblasts and the secretion of extracellular matrix in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> injured lung .	73	30	0	None

To our knowledge , no NSCLC patient who initially responded to but then progressed on either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib has yet been treated with lapatinib . In some of the patient specimens analyzed , the actual sequencing peaks demonstrating the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation were smaller than originally anticipated . These results differ from those of acquired resistance mutation in CML [ ] , GIST [ , ] , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] .	16	68	40	None
For example , in CML , a commonly found mutation is a C→T single nucleotide change that replaces threonine with isoleucine at position 315 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the ABL kinase domain [ , , ] . In GIST and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , respectively , the analogous T670I mutation in KIT and T674I mutation in PDGFR-alpha have been associated with acquired resistance to this drug [ , ] . To determine whether lung cancers that acquire clinical resistance to either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib display additional mutations in the EGFR kinase domain , we have examined the status of EGFR exons 18 to 24 in tumors from five patients who initially responded but subsequently progressed while on these drugs .	79	40	24 25	None

CN gain of GSTT1 was closely associated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance .	46	24	31	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity phenotypes of single point mutations in unc-18 We recently demonstrated that a single point mutation ( D216N ) in Munc18 acts biochemically by reducing binding to the assembled SNARE complex and that the orthologous mutation in C. elegans unc-18 ( D214N ) reduces sensitivity to both low and high concentrations of exogenous ethanol [ ] . Previously , we have biochemically characterised other point mutations in Munc18 that affect binding to other proteins including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( inhibits binding to closed-conformation syntaxin ) [ , ] , P242S ( inhibits binding to Mint proteins ) [ ] and E466K ( enhances binding to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) [ ] .	0	104	76	None

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib belong to the first generation of TKIs and have reversible binding features . The principal predictive factor for response to such drugs is the presence of somatic “activating” mutations in the EGFR gene that cause an aberrant and constitutive activation of the receptor at the membrane level , resulting in a growth advantage of tumor cells through the activation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , PI3K/Akt , and STAT signaling pathways . In about 50 % of cases , a secondary mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is supposed to be responsible for resistance. , Other mechanisms involve MET gene amplification ( 5 % –20 % ) ,	0	63	83	None

Whether this strategy can overcome the oncogenic effect of the recurrent somatic <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the first fibronectin Type III domain of EphA2 reported in 7 % of squamous cell lung carcinomas ( SQCLC ) is unknown . This mutation promotes cell survival and metastasis through activation of p130Cas which appears to be responsive to mTOR inhibition. [ ] In comparison , several kinase domain mutations in EPHA3 result in diminished phosphorylation of the EPHA3 receptor , which functionally attenuates the tumor-suppressive effects of wild-type EPHA3 through regulation of AKT activity. [ ] Various multikinase inhibitors currently in clinical use potently target Eph receptors , such as dasatinib and nilotinib . XL647 ( also known as PRIM-001 , KD019 ) , a reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor of various kinases ( EGFR , VEGFR2 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , c-kit ) in the nanomolar range including EphB4 , is currently being compared in a Phase III study to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in NSCLC as second-or third-line therapy .	154	133	12	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> family members play an important role in the control of gene expression in several phases of the cell cycle and in multiple checkpoints .

This findings show that EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is a common resistance mechanism to both reversible , and when amplified , the irreversible EGFR inhibitors . In our case , the response duration of irreversible EGFR inhibitor was 11 months which was unusually longer than those of initial gefitinib ( for 4 months ) and second round <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( for 6 months ) treatments . Recently an alternative approach is to develop novel strategies , instead of irreversible EGFR inhibitors , to inhibit EGFR and/or EGFR signaling , including the use of inhibitors of HSP90 and/or EGFR downstream signaling ( such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors ) as these resistant cancers still remain dependent on EGFR signaling for their growth .	55	103	5	None

In addition , they showed that two dominant activating mutations in the PI3K catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PI3K-CA ) , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and H1047R , which are prevalent in breast cancer , also confer resistance to lapatinib [ ] . Conversely , Li et al. infected cells with lentiviruses expressing either wild-type kinases ( Src , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Lyn , EGFR and others ) or kinase alleles with gatekeeper mutations . Through this approach , they showed that Src Family Kinases (SFKs) , as well as EGFR , are relevant targets for the Src inhibitor dasatinib and that acquired T790M mutations render cells resistant not only to erlotinib and gefitinib , but also to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	113	56	21	None
Based on our data , we hypothesized that PRR of hnRNP L binds to PTB and cooperatively suppresses inclusion of exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .

Fresh data on asthma has shown that at least a part of the mechanism of action of XQLD against OVA sensitized allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model is different from that of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and the results demonstrate that XQLD alleviates nasal symptoms by the inhibition of histamine signaling through suppression of TDI induced <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and HDC gene upregulation [ ] .	33	55	55	None
In both cases the enhanced lytic sensitivity was at least in part due to upregulation of costimulatory molecules on cancer cells , for example , LFA-3 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . More recently , Ramakrishnan and colleagues showed in a murine model that paclitaxel , cisplatin , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> all sensitize tumor cells to more efficient killing by CTL [ ] . In this system , however , the responsible mechanism on murine as well and human cancer cells went via upregulation of the mannose-6-phosphate <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor on cancer cells which is required for granzyme B associated killing [ ] .	46	27	83	None

The importance of D2 receptor involvement in ethanol actions on PRL production and cell proliferation is evident in the experiment where <ANNO_TYPE_drug> actions on lactotropes ' function were evaluated in clonal cell lines expressing various levels of D2 receptor isoforms . It was found that V cells , which lacked functional D2 receptors and had high basal levels of PRL , showed a significant reduction in PRL production following D2S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor transfection . As described by an extended allosteric ternary complex model of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation , receptors spontaneously isomerize between active and inactive conformations , so receptors can modulate signaling pathways in the absence of an agonist .	21	85 86 87 88	71	None
Moreover , some studies suggest that alterations in the proportion of D2L and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> isoform expression could be involved in D2R agonist resistance , , . In addition , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitize anterior pituitary cells to different proapoptotic stimuli , , and we have observed that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> induces apoptosis of lactotropes only when cells are cultured in the presence of E2 , making it plausible that the hormonal milieu could affect the action of D2R agonists in patients with prolactinomas .	29	45	13	None

Cyclin D1 , in association with cyclin dependent kinase-4 and -6 , induces the cell to enter the S phase by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressing protein , which binds to transcription factors , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . In addition to the overexpression of cyclin D1 , other genes that overexpress in MCL , such as VEGF and Raf-1 , represent further possible targets for mTOR inhibitors . Indeed , a constitutive activation of Akt and mTOR pathways either in MCL cell lines ( Granta 519 , Jeko-1 , and SP-53 ) or in primary cultures from 30 % of MCL patients has been reported. , Moreover , mTOR inhibitors in MCL could synergize with other “canonical” agents , such as vincristine , doxorubicin , bortezomib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , with resulting inhibition of Raf-1 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and mTOR . ,	126 127	135	35	None

Burwinkel and colleagues reported a significant association of coding variants Q586 H and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> of NCOA3 with familial breast cancer risk , and further suggested that familial breast cancer patients may condense the rare allele 's contribution to the protective effect of breast cancer [ ] .	37	28	58	None
For the first cycle , a total of 85 mg ( 40 mg/m2 ) of liposomal doxorubicin in 250 ml of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( 5 % glucose solution ) was prescribed with the same premedications used for the prior <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . <ANNO_TYPE_gene> was infused at a rate of 1 mg/min for the first 20 min .	38	40	21	None
Studies analyzing sensitivity to drugs in hepatocellular carcinoma cells found that the mutant R248Q confers chemoresistance to doxorubicin and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . This effect is mediated by the upregulation of multidrug resistance gene 1 ( MDR1 , also ABCB1 or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) [ ] .

Residuals were calculated from linear regression model ( formula : <ANNO_TYPE_variant> status∼metabolite concentration+model 2 ) .	28	91	107	None
Recently , genome-wide screening for the genetic determinants of gout found that an SNP of ABCG2/BCRP ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is associated with high uric acid levels , and demonstrated that uric acid is a natural substrate of ABCG2/BCRP. , ABCG2/BCRP also appears to play a protective role against xenobiotics and their metabolites. , The typical ABCG2/BCRP substrates , irinotecan and SN-38 , are detoxified by glucuronidation with uridine-diphosphate–glucuronyltransferase , and ABCG2/BCRP can extrude SN-38–glucuronide . Interestingly , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> can transport another of the glucuronide conjugates , 17-β-estradiol 17- ( β-D-glucuronide ) , and the sulfated conjugates estrone-3-sulfate <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are also substrates of ABCG2/BCRP. , The apical localization of ABCG2/BCRP in the intestinal epithelium and the bile canalicular membrane also suggests the intestinal absorption and hepatobiliary excretion of ABCG2/BCRP substrates. , – ABCG2/BCRP may also play a protective role by transporting dietary carcinogens .	97 98	77	17	None

In WT <ANNO_TYPE_gene> the Mn ( II ) ions are coordinated by the negatively charged amino acids D276 , D287 , E412 , E452 , and by a phosphate group . Thus the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation decreases by two units the negative charge in the coordination sphere ; nevertheless , our in vitro data showed that the mutation does not affect the binding of the Mn ( II ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	68	2	33	None
In addition to BCR-ABL , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibits other oncogenic kinases including the Src family kinases , c-Kit , and platelet derived growth factor receptors ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) . Nilotinib inhibits kinase targets including BCR-ABL , PDGFR , and c-Kit , but not the Src family kinases . While the first and second-generation TKIs have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients with CML and Ph+ ALL , resistance still occurs in a subset of patients who harbor BCR-ABL mutations , particularly the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	5	25	80	None
To study this pathway we utilized an osteosarcoma cell line that conditionally expresses a dominant negative mutant of E2F1 which localizes to the nucleus upon activation with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ER-dnE2F1 ) .

However , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway dysregulation at points both upstream and downstream of BRAF likely play a critical role in acquired resistance . Activation of NRAS is one such mechanism , and it is thought that oncogenic mutations in NRAS result in sustained activation of CRAF , providing a bypass mechanism to BRAF inhibition . An analysis of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant clones known to harbor the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation identified a de novo activating mutation in NRAS ( Q61K ) in one cell line .	57	2	64	None
Resistance to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in lung cancer could be overcome in vitro by irreversible EGFR small molecule inhibitors such as CL-387,785 [ ] and BIBW2992 [ ] , Hsp90 inhibition [ ] , combination of multiple RTK inhibitor and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor [ ] , combination of TS-targeting drugs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or pemetrexed ) and BIBW2992 [ ] , and novel mutant-selective EGFR kinase inhibitors [ ] .	50	40	3	None

Metzgeroth et al reported a patient with T674I mutation that was insensitive to both <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and sorafenib . Dasatinib is a dual <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor that also inhibits PDGFRs and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion but has no effect on imatinib-resistant FIP1L1-PDGFRA T674I and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants .	14	22	40	None
We observed that the cellular FTO protein is present in a dot-like manner in nucleoplasm , and partially colocalizes with splicing or splicing related speckle factors SART1 ( U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP associated protein 1 ) and SC35 ( serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 ) , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> phosphorylated at Ser2 ( Pol II-S2P ) ( and ) , but does not colocalize with telomere marker TRF1 , replication site PCNA , Cajal body marker Coilin , cleavage body marker CstF64 , or P-body marker DCP1A ( ) . To investigate whether FTO is related to mRNA processing , we performed the same immunostaining experiment upon inhibition of Pol II-S2P transcription with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ActD ) . Quantitative foci analysis showed that the FTO foci number per cell was significantly decreased from 43±7 ( −ActD ) to 22 ± 5 ( +ActD ) with P-value less than 0.0001 , similar to that observed for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> S2P from 90 ± 12 ( −ActD ) to 24 ± 5 ( +ActD ) , but not SC35 ( ) , upon transcription inhibition ( ) .	111 112	44 45 46	154	None
Again , the activity of this resistance mechanism could be suppressed through combined MET and BRAF or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibition . Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and Wnt pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( T315I ) following imatinib .	73	17	134	None

Interestingly , the IC50 values of SN38 , mitoxantrone , doxorubicin , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and etoposide for Flp-ln-293 cells expressing other variants were significantly lower than those for cells expressing wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . Notably , F208S and S441N were not expressed in the cells , suggesting that the rest of the variants ( S248P , F431L , and F489L ) may also impart impaired function of BCRP . Another study showed that the P269S ( C.805OT , Ex7 ; rs34678167 ) and Q126Stop ( C.376OT , Ex4 ; rs72552713 ) alleles were found among Korean subjects , and that the transport activity of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant decreased based on methotrexate uptake by vesicles expressing this variant .	12	31	104	None
In mammals , mTOR associates with mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 ( mLST8 ) , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> AKT substrate of 40 kDa ( AKT1S1 ) and regulatory associated protein of mTOR ( RAPTOR ) to form the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) . The mTORC1 activates protein synthesis through modulation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and the translational initiation factor eIF-4E binding protein 1 ( 4E-BP1 ) . mTORC1 is acutely sensitive to inhibition by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	16	58	None

Cyclin D1 , in association with cyclin dependent kinase-4 and -6 , induces the cell to enter the S phase by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressing protein , which binds to transcription factors , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . In addition to the overexpression of cyclin D1 , other genes that overexpress in MCL , such as VEGF and Raf-1 , represent further possible targets for mTOR inhibitors . Indeed , a constitutive activation of Akt and mTOR pathways either in MCL cell lines ( Granta 519 , Jeko-1 , and SP-53 ) or in primary cultures from 30 % of MCL patients has been reported. , Moreover , mTOR inhibitors in MCL could synergize with other “canonical” agents , such as vincristine <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , bortezomib , and rituximab , with resulting inhibition of Raf-1 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and mTOR . ,	121 122	135	35	None

Cyclin D1 , in association with cyclin dependent kinase-4 and -6 , induces the cell to enter the S phase by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressing protein , which binds to transcription factors , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . In addition to the overexpression of cyclin D1 , other genes that overexpress in MCL , such as VEGF and Raf-1 , represent further possible targets for mTOR inhibitors . Indeed , a constitutive activation of Akt and mTOR pathways either in MCL cell lines ( Granta 519 , Jeko-1 , and SP-53 ) or in primary cultures from 30 % of MCL patients has been reported. , Moreover , mTOR inhibitors in MCL could synergize with other “canonical” agents , such <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , doxorubicin , bortezomib , and rituximab , with resulting inhibition of Raf-1 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and mTOR . ,	119 120	135	35	None

The in vivo gene response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mesylate was also included in these analyses due to the overlapping functions of this drug , and its use as an experimental treatment for SSc [ ] .	58	34 35	15	None
This would suggest that ER function may be dependent on cross-talk between <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and ER in the endocrine-resistant cell lines . In support of this , inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> by RAD001 significantly reduced phosphorylation of ER Ser167 , in keeping with previous studies [ , ] and resulted in a modest inhibitory effect on E2-driven phosphorylation of ER Ser118 . In MCF7-AROM1 xenografts , the combination of RAD001 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced tumor regression , as opposed to the stabilization observed with the monotherapies , although analysis of growth rates did not show this to be statistically significant .	69	12	28	None
Subsequent experiments for increasing the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> production rate by overexpressing either each of the presumed limiting steps , or in combination with other glycolytic enzymes ( ) , have been unsuccessful and , even in some cases , a slight decrease in flux has been attained . This was accompanied by a 10–20 % decrease in PFK-1 expression , which might have attenuated the flux increase . In yeasts , HK is not product inhibited by <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or ADP ; instead , it is strongly feedback inhibited by <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	5	88 89	76	None
Activated NFKB induces upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes , growth regulatory cytokines ( IL6 or growth regulated α ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) ) , and angiogenic factors ( IL8 ) [ ] .

These include the use of second generation TKIs in case of therapeutic failure or intolerance , e.g. , Dasatinib , Nilotinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and Ponatinib , the latter particularly used in case of a secondary resistance by <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] ( ) . 3.2 . <ANNO_TYPE_gene>	22	46	37	None
Both palmitic acid and stearic acid are desaturated by stearoyl-CoA desaturase to form palmitoleic ( 16 : 1 , n7 ) and oleic acids ( 18 : 1 , n9 ) , which are subsequently esterified with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> to form TAG . An important <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in FA synthesis is reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) , synthesized in the cytoplasm as a by-product of two pathways .

Moreover , as reviewed recently , the mechanism for the anti-diabetic properties of triterpenoids is unlikely to be confined to the simultaneous presence of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation , particularly after the removal of the treatment . Oleanolic acid ( OA ) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid abundantly available in the plant kingdom and it has been used for the treatment of lung cancer . We recently observed that OA was able to substantially reduce hyperglycemia in a mouse model of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> generated by high-fat diet ( HF ) plus low doses of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> (STZ) injections and this effect was sustained for at least 4 weeks after the cessation of its administration ( referred as Study 1 ) .	90	24	78	None

The catalytic site of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> contains several conserved <ANNO_TYPE_drug> residues . Substitution of the residues His30 or His481 in yeast transketolase has been reported to impair transketolase function .

Based on our data , we hypothesized that PRR of hnRNP L binds to PTB and cooperatively suppresses inclusion of exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . We thus examined the role of PRR of hnRNP L on the interaction with PTB .

The two mutations were shown to independently induce <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells engineered to express the L1196M and C1156Y mutations . By mid-2012 , additional patient studies led to the discovery of several other secondary mutations , . That is , three other mutations in the a-Chelix were discovered : a threonine insertion at amino acid 1151 ( 1151Tins ) , a leucine to arginine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and phenylalanine to leucine ( F1174L ) .	8	11	67	None
In the multivariate analysis of overall survival , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , male sex , the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , brain metastases , and the presence of bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma were associated with poor prognosis . Large-scale screening of patients for EGFR mutations , with subsequent customisation of erlotinib treatment , was demonstrated to be feasible and to improve outcomes . Subsequently , two phase III trials of Asian patients with EGFR mutations demonstrated that progression-free survival was longer for patients receiving <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment than for those receiving chemotherapy .	82	8 9	18	None
In HPV positive cells , HDAC binds to E7 preventing HDAC binding to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> promoter , leading to upregulation of E2F and increase proliferation . Tricostatin A , a HDAC inhibitor , can compete with E6 for p53 binding , resulting in p53 hyperacetylation and increased apoptosis , and clinical trials in combination with chemoradiation are ongoing , . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , another <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor , is under evaluation in respiratory papillomatosis , a disease related to HPV virus other than 16 and 18 .	59	62 63	13	None
Clinical trials of new small molecule TKIs ( e.g. <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , sorafenib and midostaurin ) were not ideal against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> PDGFRα despite these drugs in vitro activity . For instance , one <ANNO_TYPE_gene> patient in blast crisis harboring T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα showed a short response , followed by a rapid emergence of pan-resistance D842V mutation in FIP1L1-PDGFRα .	9	32	19	None
In this study , we design , synthesize and evaluated a number of novel quinazoline derivatives by exchanging the positions of the C5 and C6 substituents and varying the C4-amino functionality of gefitinib , and report that compound V1801 having a trifluoromethyl group at the C5'-position and a bromine at the C2'-position of the aniline moiety substituted at the C4 position of quinazoline core overcomes <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance via up-regulation of Noxa , suggesting a novel strategy to fight against NSCLC with EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis constitutes one of the main safeguards against tumorigenesis , and the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> family includes the central players of this pathway that regulate cell fate through the control of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization .	65	101	82	None
( B ) <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ponatinib-resistant cells were treated with imatinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , or dasatinib for 24 h. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with phospho-specific Abl and Crk-L Abs. β-tubulin was used as the loading control . Co-treatment with ponatinib and vorinostat is effective against and induces apoptosis in ponatinib-resistant cells Since vorinostat was effective against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant cells , we investigated whether ponatinib-resistant cells were inhibited by this HDACi .	11	3	58	None
As seen in H1299 cells , 6474 synergizes with paclitaxel ( CI average 0.96 ) , but is antagonistic with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( CI average 1.51 ) and gemcitabine ( CI average 1.46 ) . E2F3 levels impact sensitivity to paclitaxel The observations that an <ANNO_TYPE_variant> inhibitor could synergize with paclitaxel and the previously discussed increase in E2F3 levels following early time point treatments with HLM006474 suggested that E2F3 activity might play a role in paclitaxel sensitivity .	20	44	44	None
Potential , yet controversial , mechanisms of resistance comprise BCR-ABL gene mutations , overexpression and amplification of the BCR-ABL gene locus , , activation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> independent pathways or increased drug efflux , , , as well as pharmacokinetic resistance . Mutations in the kinase domain of ABL , which either prevent adoption of the inactive conformation required for IM binding or directly interfere with inhibitor interaction , have been identified as the predominant cause of relapse during IM therapy . Second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors , such as Dasatinib , Nilotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , , are capable of overcoming the majority of resistance conferring mutations clinically observed , with the exception of the highly IM-resistant gatekeeper mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	93	25	118	None
Data reported by Yi et al. confirmed that inactivation of the heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) is involved in Vorinostat induced ERα degradation and that the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> CHIP ( C-terminal Hsc70 interacting protein ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced ERα degradation [ ] . By contrast , a recent paper indicated that TSA induced acetylation of ERα <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells was accompanied by an increased stability of the ERα protein [ ] .	34 35	25 26	55 56	None
In order to evaluate if the combined <ANNO_TYPE_drug> regimen can efficiently shut down Bcr-Abl and induce cell death in Bcr-Abl positive leukemic cell lines that are resistant to imatinib , we developed two different cell lines derived from K562 ( K562-R ) and LAMA84 ( LAMA84-R ) cell lines , which are resistant to 1μM imatinib . Additionally , we have used the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Bcr-Abl <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell line , a Baf3 derivative resistant to 1μM imatinib .	7	63	65	None
Global induction of apoptosis with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , cycloheximide or puromycin was shown to lead to a loss of cell coupling , probably due to caspase-3 mediated degradation of Cx43 , in primary bovine lens epithelial and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts [ ] . In fact , Stat3 inhibition in cells transformed by Src or the Large Tumor antigen of Simian Virus 40 led to apoptosis [ , , ] , possibly due to activation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family , potent apoptosis inducers , by these oncogenes .	5	75 76	77	None
We have identified two MCB RCs ( RC6 and RC20 ) that exhibit cyclic expression profile peaking during the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> transition ; the expression traces of member genes from both RCs are displayed in . RC20 contains 79 genes , whose promoters , according to the binding data , have high occupancy of the transcription factors Swi6 ( 95 % ) , Swi4 ( % ) , Mbp1 ( 62 % ) and Stb1 ( 14 % ) . The Swi factor Swi6 is a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for both Swi4 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , forming SBF and MBF activators with them respectively to regulate late G1 genes .	85	90	19	None
The introduction of a peptide containing the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> scaffolding domain of caveolin 1 is sufficient to inhibit fibrocyte accumulation in the lungs in a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced animal model of fibrosis , suggesting that the caveolin scaffolding domain could be employed as a potential therapy for SSc lung disease ( Tourkina et al. , ) . In yet another example , the single nucleotide polymorphism <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in the gene expressing Toll-like receptor 3 in pulmonary fibroblasts has been found to correlate with a greater risk of mortality in IPF patients ( O'Dwyer et al. , ) .	24	7	64	None
KIT is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase that initiates multiple downstream signaling pathways , such as the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and JAK/STAT pathways . KIT gene mutations are mainly found in melanomas , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is an effective inhibitor of this oncogene . Here , we observed mutations <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and V559A , which are the most common KIT mutation types .	33	18	47	None
To prepare the mutants , we mutated arginines of the WT sequence inside the transformed PKA model and obtained the models that contain <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and the peptides LARASLG ( R18A ) , LRAASLG ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , LKRASLG ( R18K ) , LRKASLG ( R19K ) , LHRASLG ( R18H ) , and LRHASLG ( R19H ) . We also prepared the models including the shorter chain peptides RRASLG , RASLG , and LRRASL . For the mutants that contain histidine we prepared the models containing neutral histidine with the hydrogen atoms at position δ or ε ( Hδ and Hε ) , and the models containing the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> Hp ( see the next section ) .	108 109	23	34	None
Thus , the patient began to take gefitinib at 250 mg/day because <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene analysis in this patient showed a deletion mutation in exon 19 and point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 by direct sequence method ( ) . The tumor size of right middle lobe and lower lobe was decreasing , and the metastatic nodules of both upper lobes had nearly disappeared . Although gefitinib was discontinued because the disease had progressed , the patient with a good performance status received 2 courses of pemetrexed and 4 sequential courses of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> chemotherapy ( ) .	91	12	28	None
BRAF , which is located directly downstream from RAS , can have activating mutations leading to stimulation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway [ , ] . BRAF mutations appear to confer a poor prognosis , and it appears that BRAF mutations also predict for a lack of response to antiEGFR monoclonal antibodies [ , , , ] . Loupakis et al. analyzed 87 patients with KRAS WT tumors for the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation who were receiving <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and cetuximab for refractory metastatic CRC .	75	19	70	None
This is in contrast to the overlapping resistance profiles displayed for ABL inhibitors , such as imatinib , nilotinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which all show resistance to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutation , . There were some similarities observed between the resistance phenotype described in our studies and those reported by others . For instance , Piloto et al. reported activation of the Ras/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway in association with CEP-5214 and CEP-701 resistance , and we similarly observed elevated phospho-ERK1/ERK2 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in MOLM13-R-PKC412 cells , consistent with elevated FLT3 protein levels .	21	81	29	None
While initial studies of first-generation CDK inhibitors , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , failed to demonstrate efficacy in preclinical studies , second-generation CDK inhibitors ( SCH 727965 ) , have shown more promising results in halting melanoma progression in mouse xenografts . This effect is potentiated when CDK inhibitors are combined with paclitaxel. , RB1 is the central piece of the pathway controlled by p16INK4A , serving in its unphosphorylated form to sequester <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , preventing it from inducing gene expression critical for transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle .	10	72 73 74	72	None
Moreover , the cleaved form of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> was elevated in H1975TM/LR cells , indicating that chol-TEG modification did not alter the ability of DzT to specifically trigger apoptosis in EGFR T790M mutant cells . Besides , after EGF treatment , cDzT remained its suppression effect on EGFR protein expression and downstream signaling including EGFR , STAT3 , AKT , and ERK ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Synergistic antitumor effect of combined treatment with cDzT and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in vitro and in vivo cDzT could be used as single agent or as part of combination therapy with second generation TKIs to increase efficacy in the treatment of NSCLCs that harbor the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	76	6	111	None
EGFR gene mutations indicate sensitivity to gefitinib , and it was demonstrated that about 85 % of patients with NSCLC who obtained benefit from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment were found to have mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene [ - ] . EGFR mutations in exon 19 ( short in-frame deletions ) or 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( point mutation ) affect the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain leading to the activation of 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds , which function to compete with ATP [ ] . Anti-EGFR therapy can consequently lead to the downregulation of downstream signaling cascades , such as the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , RAS/Erk , MAPK , and STAT pathways , responsible for cell proliferation and survival , resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis , respectively .	24	112	61	None
Most surprisingly , we demonstrate that the epistatic interactions between mutants of unc-18 and rab-3 are distinct depending on the phenotypic context such that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation acts downstream of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in exocytosis whereas it acts upstream of Rab3 in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity .	40	30	25	None
This then indicates that whatever the E465K mutation is doing at high <ANNO_TYPE_drug> concentrations , it acts both downstream and independent of functional rab-3 , which itself is downstream of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . Interestingly , the E465K mutation is modelled on a Sly1p ( yeast Sec1/Munc18 protein ) that bypasses the requirement for a functional <ANNO_TYPE_gene> protein during ER to Golgi vesicle trafficking [ ] .	12	54	30	None
mTORC1 controls cell growth and translation through the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4EBP1 , which regulate either the translation of ribosomal proteins or the cap dependent translation by inhibition of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E , respectively. , The activated mTOR pathway has been identified in several human malignancies , thus being an attractive target for anticancer therapy . mTORC1 activity is inhibited by rapalogs such as rapamycin ( sirolimus ) and associated analogs ( temsirolimus/CCI-779 , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , ridaforolimus/AP23573 ) . These drugs suppress mTORC1 activity forming a complex with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> 12 .	86	100 101 102	14	None
The second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors , dasatinib and nilotinib , can circumvent most mutations that confer resistance to imatinib ; the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , however , causes resistance to all <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase inhibitors developed so far .

However , a delay in disease onset and/or an extended lifespan was observed for treatments using antioxidants ( 5–26 % and 4–60 % , respectively ; Ginkgo biloba <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , lyophilized red wine , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , N-acetyl cysteine , catalase , ginseng , folic acid and vitamin B12 , epigallocatechin gallate , L-carnitine , vitamin E and trientine plus ascorbate ) , as well as therapies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction ( 7 % and 6–17 % , respectively ; creatine and pyruvate ) and SOD1 stability ( 8 % and 5–10 % , respectively ; trientine ( alone and with ascorbate ) and zinc ) . Dietary modifications such as high fat and fast food diets extended lifespan by 20–22 % , however caloric restriction hastened disease onset and endpoint in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mouse model – .	28 29	35 36	132 133	None
Based on the charge carrier , semiconducting materials can be divided into two groups : n-type ( electrons are major carrier , such as ZnO , SnO2 , TiO2 , In2O3 , WOx , AgVO3 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and MoO3 ) and p-type ( holes are major carrier , such as CuO , NiO and TeO2 ) materials . Target gas species can also be classified into two groups : oxidizing gas or electron acceptors such as O2 , NO2 and reducing gas or electron donor such as H2 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , HCHO , CO and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	95	36	89	None
In a cohort of 309 patients from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study ( AOCS ) , we found three common single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( rs1128503 ) , G2677T/A ( rs2032582 ) and C3435T ( rs1045642 ) ) were associated with significant differences in progression-free survival ( PFS ) for the subgroup of women with ≤ 1 cm residual disease who received paclitaxel <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> first-line chemotherapy .	69 70	27	29	None
Although this hypothesis has not been directly tested for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> specifically , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> hypomorphs in C. elegans do have reduced sensitivity to volatile anaesthetics [ ] emphasizing a potential convergence of cellular effectors of various anaesthetics at the presynaptic terminal . On the other hand , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation acts to increase Rab3 binding , at least for Munc18 [ ] .	9	12	47	None
In this study , we have evaluated the effect of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and A3AR stimulation in the absence or in the presence of PEMFs on pro-inflammatory cytokine release from T/C-28a2 chondrocytes and hFOB 1.19 osteoblasts . The release of inflammatory mediators were stimulated by using Il-1β , a pro-inflammatory cytokines that interacts with most cell type and is one of the most important <ANNO_TYPE_gene> of the inflammatory response , especially in cartilage and bone pathologies . In both the cell line examined , CGS 21680 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were able to significantly decrease the IL-1β stimulated production of the inflammatory mediators IL-6 , IL-8 and PGE2 .	85	62	10	None
Of these two candidate variants , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in HOXA1 changes a histidine ( H ) to arginine ( R ) at position 73 ( H73R ) and disrupted a string of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> repeats in exon 1 , while the 9-base insertion c.82insACAGCGCCC ( referred as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> allele ) in exon 1 of HOXB1 introduces into the amino acid sequence the tripeptide histidine-serine-alanine ( H-S-A ) .	32	46	7	None
The sensitivity of each mutant was then determined using <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells expressing both CXCR4 and CCR5 ( ) . In single mutants , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and M425K substitutions conferred reduced sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 4.1-fold and 2.6-fold , respectively ) , whereas N183K had a minor effect ( 1.5-fold ) as shown in .	31	9	23	None
By contrast , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation confers a higher affinity toward ATP than the L858R mutant such that the combined double mutant L858R/T790M results in an activated enzyme that is resistant to ATP-competitive TKIs .

The importance of D2 receptor involvement in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> actions on PRL production and cell proliferation is evident in the experiment where ethanol actions on lactotropes ' function were evaluated in clonal cell lines expressing various levels of D2 receptor isoforms . It was found that V cells , which lacked functional D2 receptors and had high basal levels of PRL , showed a significant reduction in PRL production following <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D2L receptor transfection . As described by an extended allosteric ternary complex model of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation , receptors spontaneously isomerize between active and inactive conformations , so receptors can modulate signaling pathways in the absence of an agonist .	7	85 86 87 88	69	None
Whether this strategy can overcome the oncogenic effect of the recurrent somatic <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the first fibronectin Type III domain of EphA2 reported in 7 % of squamous cell lung carcinomas ( SQCLC ) is unknown . This mutation promotes cell survival and metastasis through activation of p130Cas which appears to be responsive to mTOR inhibition. [ ] In comparison , several kinase domain mutations in EPHA3 result in diminished phosphorylation of the EPHA3 receptor , which functionally attenuates the tumor-suppressive effects of wild-type EPHA3 through regulation of AKT activity. [ ] Various multikinase inhibitors currently in clinical use potently target Eph receptors , such as dasatinib and nilotinib . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( also known as PRIM-001 , KD019 ) , a reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor of various kinases ( EGFR , VEGFR2 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , c-kit ) in the nanomolar range including EphB4 , is currently being compared in a Phase III study to erlotinib in NSCLC as second-or third-line therapy .	111	133	12	None
We have used the inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( mTOR ) , NVP-BEZ235 and GSK2126458 ( PI3K/mTOR ) – to test for possible pathway interactions with trametinib ( ) .

Loo et al. also demonstrated that binding of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , cyclosporin A and rhodamine B could prevent the formation of a cross-link between L339C and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , suggesting that the ligands are at least partially located between these two residues . This is also the case for the three docking clusters in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , which are presented in this study .	8	52	25	None
While preparing this manuscript , Cortot et al. reported that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> derived clones with acquired resistance to mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors and irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors in the absence of EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> demonstrate a significantly activated IGF-1R signaling , and pharmacological inhibition of IGF-1R restored sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors . Despite no patient data supporting the role of IGF-1R in acquired resistance to gefitinib/erlotinib , we are beginning to accumulate evidence from preclinical models indicating that clinical trials of IGF-1R inhibitors with demonstrated activity in unselected NSCLC patients might play a role in association with EGFR inhibitors in the management of NSCLCs with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	105	10	30	None
Using the erlotinib-sensitive EGFR mutant NSCLC cell line HCC4006 harboring the delL747-E749 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR exon 19 , Suda et al. established that mesenchymal status , not a specific oncogenic activated protein , could sufficiently promote loss of EGFR dependence to confer resistance to erlotinib . More recently , Chang et al. confirmed that in the absence of the common second-site EGFR mutation T790M or MET amplification , acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> occurs in EGFR mutated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells that have undergone EMT .	73	78	13	None

It should be noted that increased IGF-1R activation in erlotinib-refractory delE746-A750 mutated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells occurred in our lab models independently of changes in IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) ( data not shown ) .	105	119	30	None
In the present work , the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .2/A1929P mutant exhibited virtually complete voltage-dependence of inactivation , compared to the partial VDI of Cav1 .2 . The importance of this CaN site in regulating VDI was further confirmed by mutating two vicinal <ANNO_TYPE_drug> residues , which are located within the CaN minimal binding domain at the α11.2 C-terminus . Although no direct effect of the HH/AA mutation on CaN binding was reported , the CaV1 .2/HH/AA mutant displayed almost a complete voltage-dependence of inactivation similar to that of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	41	6	88	None
These enzymes are essential for DNA synthesis and replication , [ ] and pancreatic cancers with increased RR expression are resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] These data suggest that activation of Rb following GSK3β inhibition and the resultant inactivation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> may sensitize cancer cells to gemcitabine by affecting RR expression [ ] .	22	40	39 40	None
Finally , Shin and coworkers engineered the S. cerevisiae strain ( W303-1A ) with four heterologous genes , the PAL gene from Rhodosporidium toruloides , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and the 4CL1 genes from A. thaliana , and the STS gene from Arachis hypogea [ ] . Overexpression of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase ( ACC1 ) gene for increasing the pool of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> resulted in an engineered strain termed W303-1A/ACC1 harboring the p425PAL , p423C4H , and pESCTRP4CL1-STS plasmids capable of synthesizing 5.8 mg/L <ANNO_TYPE_drug> upon feeding with 12 mM tyrosine in YP medium containing 2 % galactose .	81	59	26	None

EGFR gene mutations indicate sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and it was demonstrated that about 85 % of patients with NSCLC who obtained benefit from gefitinib treatment were found to have mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene [ - ] . EGFR mutations in exon 19 ( short in-frame deletions ) or 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( point mutation ) affect the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain leading to the activation of 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds , which function to compete with ATP [ ] . Anti-EGFR therapy can consequently lead to the downregulation of downstream signaling cascades , such as the PI3K/Akt , RAS/Erk , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and STAT pathways , responsible for cell proliferation and survival , resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis , respectively .	6	116	61	None

In GIST and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , respectively , the analogous <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in KIT and T674I mutation in PDGFR-alpha have been associated with acquired resistance to this drug [ , ] . To determine whether lung cancers that acquire clinical resistance to either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib display additional mutations in the EGFR kinase domain , we have examined the status of EGFR exons 18 to 24 in tumors from five patients who initially responded but subsequently progressed while on these drugs .	42	3	9	None
Most surprisingly , we demonstrate that the epistatic interactions between mutants of unc-18 and rab-3 are distinct depending on the phenotypic context such that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation acts downstream of Rab3 in exocytosis whereas it acts upstream of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity .	40	38	25	None
In a study that compared the efficacy of α-TEA versus vitamin E succinate , we showed α-TEA was a more effective anticancer agent because esterase activity in ovarian cancer cells clipped off the succinic moiety of vitamin E succinate , yielding <ANNO_TYPE_drug> which does induce apoptosis [ ] . The ability of α-TEA to induce apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cell lines is not restricted to A2780 and A2780/CP70R cells but has been shown in a number of human ovarian cancer cell lines including 2008 , 2008-C13 , Hey , OVCA-429 , OVCA-433 , OVCA-432 and SK-OV-3 [ ] . The ability of α-TEA to induce apoptosis in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and A2780/CP70 ovarian cancer cells requires both downregulation of ErbB mediated prosurvival factors ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and survivin ) and activation of Fas mediated mitochondrial dependent apoptosis , two complementary and necessary events .	41	124	108 109	None
Thus , five central genes common to both transcriptome networks were identified , including the proinflammatory cytokine , TNF , a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( HNF4A ) , a cytokine ( IL15 ) and two cellular activation/signaling molecules ( YWHAZ and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) .

Ubiquitin is traditionally thought of in the context of polyubiquitination that leads to protein degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system ; however , monoubiquitination of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and H2B are clear instances of alternative roles for ubiquitin in transcription and DNA repair ( , , ) . DUBs are proteases that cleave ubiquitin from target proteins , including core histone proteins , and are recognized as important regulators of the ubiquitin–proteasome system . Given that DUBs occur upstream of the proteasome , they have the potential to show greater specificity and less toxicity compared to FDA approved proteasome inhibitors such as Velcade® <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) or Kyprolis® ( carfilzomib ) .	101 102	25	24 25	None

It would be interesting to study in the future if <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , CTBP , MECP2 , LSD1 or other yet-to-be identified REST interactors are involved . Notably , we did not observe pathways specifically enriched in any group of REST targets with different <ANNO_TYPE_drug> occupancies . In summary , our results indicate that SIN3 co-localization was correlated with higher expression while EZH2/CoREST co-occupancy was associated with lower levels of expression of REST targets , with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> seemingly dominant over EZH2/CoREST .	43	75	10	None
Another study showed that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( C.805OT , Ex7 ; rs34678167 ) and Q126Stop ( C.376OT , Ex4 ; rs72552713 ) alleles were found among Korean subjects , and that the transport activity of the P296S variant decreased based on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> uptake by vesicles expressing this variant . Not all BCRP SNPs are associated with diminished transporter activity , however . The I206L ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ; C , Ex6 ; rs12721643 ) variant was found to have high transporter activity but low protein expression when transfected into HEK cells , whereas the N590Y ( c.1768A&gt ; T , Ex15 ; rs34264773 ) and D620N had higher expression but lower activity .	41	65	5	None

Drugs that target these enzymes together with agents that lower <ANNO_TYPE_variant> activity would be predicted to result in enhanced anti tumor effects . As an example of how this knowledge may lead to an effective drug combination with the PEP together with drugs that target these enzymes , we show that MTX and the PEP exhibit synergistic cell kill , likely due to decreased levels of DHFR and TK , the latter enzyme important for thymidine salvage . Studies in progress will determine the effect of longer durations of treatment with the peptide , mechanisms of resistance and combinations of the peptide with agents used to treat prostate cancer , that include <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and DNA damaging agents , given the role of E2F-1 in DNA repair [ ] .	112	10	10	None

Collectively , these studies highlight an area of investigation that could lead to a better understanding of the underlying causes for AD and impact the 25 % of the Caucasian population that carries at least one <ANNO_TYPE_variant> allele . While the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> expressing neuroblastoma cells had increased iron content and iron is a required <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for a number of enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis ( e.g. , HMGCoAR and squalene synthase ) , the cells expressed less HMGCoAR and had less total cholesterol than WT-HFE expressing controls .	54	41	36	None
For example , inhibition of mTORC1 or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> inhibits growth , but unlike mTORC1 , S6K is not essential for development . Identifying mechanisms by which the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> delays aging may provide therapeutic strategies for age related diseases to facilitate healthful longevity . Calorie restriction ( 25–40 % below ad libitum intake ) can improve insulin sensitivity , since CR–induced , insulin <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 2DG ) uptake was greater in isolated skeletal muscles from wild type compared with AKT2 knockout mice after 20 days of CR vs. ad libitum feeding [ ] .	63 64	27 28	7	None

DUBs are proteases that cleave ubiquitin from target proteins , including core histone proteins , and are recognized as important regulators of the ubiquitin–proteasome system . Given that DUBs occur upstream of the proteasome , they have the potential to show greater specificity and less toxicity compared to FDA approved proteasome inhibitors such as Velcade® ( bortezomib ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( carfilzomib ) .	104 105	25	24 25	None

It could be that the simultaneous silencing of PI3KCA and AKT3 leads to a greater activation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway , but this phenomenon needs to be clarified . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells are less sensitive to BCNU and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than U87-MG cells [ ] .	36	17	28	None
Lazzara and colleagues found that SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation was not induced in response to EGF in the H3255 cells , which harbor the missense <ANNO_TYPE_variant> exon 21 mutation , suggesting that SHP2 activity may be less efficiently promoted by EGFR L858R and the STAT3 pathway may be more active . The main problem is that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation is not abrogated by single EGFR TKI treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , afatinib or dacomitinib , - .	66	55	24	None
Surprisingly , the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation leads to decreased ability to activate ERK compared to WT EGFR which correlates with decreased EGFR internalization , reduced phosphorylation of SHP2 , hyperactivity of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and reduced sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	36	31	4	None
It was also found that a dose of 40 nM was able to completely suppress the emergence of BCR-ABL resistant mutants in vitro , although efficacy may be limited particularly in examples with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation ( IC50 of 36 nM ) . Finally , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> also inhibited the activity of members of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) , and platelet derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) families at similar doses , but it showed IC50 values more than 1,000-fold higher for inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and members of the cyclin kinase and aurora kinase families .	46	95 96	34	None

In fact , there was a markedly increased pErk signal in one NRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated cell line ( M207 ) , an observation consistent with data from others that has been attributed to loss of negative regulatory pathways [ , ] and enhanced signaling through C-Raf [ , ] . Therefore , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway signaling specifically in cell lines that harbor the BRAFV600E mutation .	52	54	13	None
We tested the ability of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to differentially block <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway signaling in a panel of human melanoma cell lines ( Table ) by quantitating the inhibition of phosphorylated Erk ( pErk ) , a downstream target of B-Raf activity , using intracellular phosphospecific flow cytometry ( Figure ) . As expected , cell lines with BRAFV600E mutation had a fast ( detectable at 1 hour ) and sustained ( persistent at 20 hours , Figure ) inhibition of pErk , although one of the cell lines ( M263 ) had lower inhibition of pErk than the rest . There was no pErk inhibition in two cell lines with NRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ( M202 and M207 ) and a cell line wild type for both oncogenes ( M257 ) .	5	9	110	None

In contrast , complex V deficiency caused by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the mitochondrial ATPase-6 gene induces ROS overproduction and neurogenic ataxia <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] . Oligomycin treatment mimics this pathological condition . We have found that oligomycin induced ROS production and cell death is blocked by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , suggesting that vitamin E treatment may be beneficial to patients with complex V deficiency .	48 49	22 23	9	None
Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( T315I ) following imatinib .	53	39	114	None

RNA ( siRNA ) -mediated depletion of NRAS in two melanoma cell lines ( 224 and BL , which harbor a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> NRAS mutation ) inhibits proliferation and renders cells more sensitive to chemotherapy ( Eskandarpour et al. , ) . A single-agent , single-arm phase II trial conducted with metastatic melanoma patients investigated Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI’s) which block farnesylation , the key activating post-translational modification of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( Sebti , ) . The outcome of this trial using the FTI <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( otherwise known as R115777 ) , showed a low response in the first 14 patients which led to early closure of the trial ( Gajewski et al. , ) .	81	67	21	None

This is in keeping with an earlier study by Di Nicolantonio and colleagues [ ] , where the response to panitumumab or cetuximab was found to be impeded by the presence of BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and restored ( in a cellular model of CRC cells ) by BRAF inhibitor sorafenib [ ] . They suggested that this experimental observation should encourage conceiving clinical trials using multiple therapies with EGFR and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors , considering that cetuximab , panitumumab , and sorafenib are already approved for clinical use . Standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy , using irinotecan or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> did not seem to be affected by KRAS/BRAF mutations [ ] .	95	70	33	None
It was not only found that 5-FU-resistant cells expressed significant higher levels of miR-34a , but also that the introduction of miR-34a into resistant cells significantly inhibited cell growth and induced a considerable attenuation of 5-FU-resistance , which was accompanied by reduced expression of SIRT1 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family proteins . These findings suggest that the resistance to 5-FU in DLD-1 cells was at least in part mediated by miR-34a/SIRT1/E2F3 cascade . Furthermore , also <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance resulted overcome by miR-34a over-expression and SIRT1 knockdown in hormone-refractory PC3 , as demonstrated by Kojima et al .	74	46	46	None
When pregnenolone is formed , it may be metabolized to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by mitochondrial 3β-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase ( 3β-HSD ) , or it may exit the mitochondria and undergo further metabolism with the final steroid hormone product dependent upon the nature of the tissue [ , ] . It has been well demonstrated that adenosine acts through four G-protein coupled membrane receptors , the A1 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , A2B , and A3 adenosine receptors [ ] . The adenosine A1 and A3 receptors ( A1-AR and A3-AR ) inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> via Gi and activate phospholipase C (PLC) [ , ] , and the adenosine A2A and A2B receptors ( A2A-AR and A2B-AR ) stimulate adenylyl cyclase via Gs [ , ] , respectively .	10	87 88	64	None
Also , centrosome amplification induced by a transient G1/S arrest because of the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , generated aneuploidy both in human and MEFs with pRb dysfunction [ ] . However , it is still controversial whether p53 loss/inactivation plays a direct role in centrosome amplification [ ] and chromosome instability [ ] . Indeed , recently it has been reported that p53 deficient cells need cyclin E over-expression , a target of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , to induce chromosome instability and centrosome amplification [ ] .	15	73 74 75	73	None
<ANNO_TYPE_gene> induction was measured in HGECs transfected either with siRNA against Sphk-1 or non targeting siRNA , 24 h after challenge with FSL-1 , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and IL-1β . We noted that the exogenous addition of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> to the cells failed to induce HBD-2 , in contrast to the data obtained in a mouse model , so we were compelled to examine the intracellular S1P levels both in the challenged state and also with inhibitor .	24	0	35	None

In another phase II POCHER trial , the proportion of R0 resection was even higher ; it was achieved in 60 % of patients who were treated with chronomodulated chemotherapy with irinotecan , oxaliplatin , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and leucovorin . In conclusion , the results of our retrospective study showed that the patients with BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation had worse prognosis than those with wt-BRAF , with lower response rates and progressed early during systemic treatment , consequently , with less possibilities to achieve resectability of metastatic disease . The definitive role of the BRAF V600E mutation as a prognostic and predictive factor to response to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> monoclonal antibodies needs to be analyzed in large prospective clinical studies .	35 36	106	55	None
Trastuzumab emtansine ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) is a new product in which the Trastuzumab moiety binds to HER2 on tumor cell surfaces and , upon internalization , the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin , thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and proliferation . Primary results from the EMILIA study , a randomized trial comparing Trastuzumab DM-1 to lapatinib and capecitabine , have shown that Trastuzumab DM-1 significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer . Further research is looking into inhibiting other targets such as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , or AKT pathways .	3	94	96	None

It was not only found that 5-FU-resistant cells expressed significant higher levels of miR-34a , but also that the introduction of miR-34a into resistant cells significantly inhibited cell growth and induced a considerable attenuation of 5-FU-resistance , which was accompanied by reduced expression of SIRT1 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family proteins .	12	71	71	None
Indeed , this has already been documented for a patient with NSCLC who relapsed after the appearance of C1156Y and L1196M mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] . L1196M represents a mutation of the “gatekeeper” residue , similar to the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mutations observed in EGFR , and T315I mutations in ABL . Mutations in the gatekeeper site are thought to increase the affinity for ATP significantly , outcompeting the effects of ATP competitive inhibitors [ ] .

Although the discovery of BRAF gene mutation and the advancement of immunotherapy in melanoma have led to the development of highly effective targeted therapy such as vemurafenib , dabrafenib , and trametinib and durable immunotherapy such as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , the efficacy of these treatments in metastatic mucosal melanoma is not clear due to limited number of these patients included in clinical trials . Recently , several clinical trials reported promising results with targeting of CKIT mutation in mucosal melanoma [ - ] . CKIT mutations are reported in 21 % of mucosal melanoma , and only patients with mucosal melanoma harboring a special subset of CKIT mutations such as L576P and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 11 and 13 may have a clinical benefit from c-KIT inhibitors [ ] .	39	37	113	None
We propose that during sustained exposure , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cancels the inhibitory effect of dopamine via increasing the ratio of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> : D2S receptors .

Structural analyses of some protein kinases ( e.g. , cyclin dependent protein kinase 1/CDK1 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , PKA , Src ) have demonstrated that phosphorylation in the activation segment leads to a conformational change in the catalytic cleft of the kinase domain , which allows the kinase domain to interact effectively with substrate proteins [ – ] .

[ ] have shown that , in L834R and/or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants of EGFR , which are pathologically found in NSCLC and 32D cells , Y845 phosphorylation takes place in an <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , but EGF- and Src independent manner .	112	15	91	None
The ability of the P2Y1 selective agonist 2MeS-ATP to mimic the effect NM23/NDPK , and for both to be prevented by the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> antagonist MRS2179 , is convincing proof that NM23/NDPK acts through P2Y1R activation in human endothelial cells . Endothelial cell VEGFR-2 activation by extracellular NM23/NDPK results in Erk1/2 phosphorylation which is prevented by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , the NM23/NDPK substrate site inhibitor [ ] , and suramin a non-specific P2YR antagonist . Together these results indicate that activation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptors by extracellular NM23/NDPK is crucial in the transactivation of VEGFR-2 and subsequent down-stream regulation of the Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway that regulates growth and migration of endothelial cells [ ] .	55 56	22	80	None

The increased inhibition potency for Erlotinib against the oncogenic EGFR L858R mutant ( over the EGFR WT protein ) correlates with decreased global connectivity of the hub residues ( Arg-958 , Glu-884 , Gln-894 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) in the mutant ( – wild type , – L858R mutant ) . The subsequent decrease in potency for Erlotinib against the oncogenic EGFR L858R + E884K double mutant correlates well with the increased global connectivity of the hub residues ( – wild type , – L858R + E884K mutant ) . On the other hand , the increased inhibition potency for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> against EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant ( compared to EGFR WT protein ) and subsequent further increase in potency for Gefitinib against the EGFR L858R + E884K double mutant correlates well with the increased global connectivity of the hub residues in the mutants ( – wild type , – L858R , – L858R + E884K ) .	99	35	102	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Trastuzumab-DM1 ) is a new product in which the Trastuzumab moiety binds to HER2 on tumor cell surfaces and , upon internalization , the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin , thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and proliferation . Primary results from the EMILIA study , a randomized trial comparing Trastuzumab DM-1 to lapatinib and capecitabine , have shown that Trastuzumab DM-1 significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer .
