The most common mutations are exon 19 deletions and exon 21 point mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , which can be found in approximately 10 % –20 % of NSCLC patients , more frequently in never smokers , women , Asians and with adenocarcinoma.– These alterations in structure of the self phosphorylating domain enhance EGFR activation and also favor binding of TKIs to their site of action . Patients who harbor these mutations experience response rates higher than 65 % and median survival of 20–30 months , as demonstrated in several retrospective studies.– Such results led investigators to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as a first-line therapy in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutated patients in prospective trials .	97 98	104	14	sensitivity
This type of drugs selectively bind to the ATP binding pocket of the phosphorylation sites on the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase domain , thus suppress EGFR activation and block downstream signaling pathways . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has shown measurable efficacy at early stage of treatment , but patients become insensitive to this drug after 6 to 9 months , which finally leads to treatment failure [ ] . Several resistance mechanisms , such as EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation that leads to a higher ATP binding capacity , and MET amplification resulting in an aberrantly activated alternative pathway that bypasses the inhibited EGF receptors , had been discovered .	32	17	72	resistance or non-response

Preliminary data were recently published that show that this agent has clinical activity in 2 patients with advanced NSCLC with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations and acquired <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance [ ] . Finally , a recent retrospective analysis of IDEAL trial specimens does not find any <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations in the tumours analysed [ ] .	24	20	43	resistance or non-response
The appearance of a second mutation represents a mechanism of resistance : in fact the authors demonstrate that the insertion of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> into test cells renders them resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in vitro . They also find that when test cells transfected with both mutations are treated with other <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors , such as AG1478 , cetuximab , erlotinib or CL-387,785 , no objective response is obtained using the first three agents , while the fourth is effective .	29	48	21	resistance or non-response

Pooled data from these three studies show that 25 of 31 ( 81 % ) patients with partial response or marked clinical improvement have an EGFR mutation , vs. none of 29 specimens from refractory patients ( p=0.0001 ) . Several other studies investigate the role of these mutations in the treatment of NSCLC with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TK inhibitors , demonstrating a statistically significant correlation between the response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib and the presence of the biological data , but this correspondence is not always 100 % [ – ] ( Table ) .	124	111	31 32	sensitivity

These patients were treated with erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Activating mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> were detected in cells obtained from primary tumour , circulating tumour cells in peripheral blood ( consistency of results – 92 % ) and in free circulating DNA ( consistency of results – 33 % ) . The authors also investigated presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in similar samples , and they detected cells harbouring that mutation in 10 patients ( n = 26 ; 38.5 % ) .	7	12	57	resistance or non-response
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 20 of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene was detected for the first time in tumour cells of a patient with progression after a few months of efficacious therapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	32	8	1	resistance or non-response
Inhibition of phosphorylation by <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase in tumour cells after afatinib exposure remains active for 48 hours ( after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> only 8 hours ) , and phosphorylation activity of the kinase after that time ranges from 50 to 70 % of the primary activity .

The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation leads to a substitution of threonine to methionine in the catalytic centre of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase , which is located in the binding pocket of TKI and ATP .

In vitro studies demonstrated that the effective concentration of erlotinib in tumour cells harbouring both the L858R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations has to be 300 times higher to induce apoptosis than in cells only with an activating mutation in codon 858 [ , ] .	52	16	79	resistance or non-response
Presence of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution may be an indication for treatment with irreversible EGFR TKI , such as neratinib , keratinib and especially afatinib , which is currently in the third phase of clinical trials . The LUX-Lung 1 study has shown that afatinib induces an objective response and prolongation of progression-free survival ( PFS ) in NSCLC patients who have been previously treated with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI for at least 12 weeks . The rationale for this type of study is the fact that afatinib has a different molecular structure when compared to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib .	92	64	2	resistance or non-response

Appearance of the most frequent activating mutation – deletion of 15 nucleotides in codons 746-750 in exon 19 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution in exon 21 of the EGFR gene – is associated with permanent stimulation of the receptor , but they also lead to an increase in both efficiency of reversible EGFR TKI and effectiveness of radiotherapy . Activating mutations of the EGFR gene have been reported in only about 10 % of Caucasians patients with NSCLC , more often in non-smokers , women , and patients with adenocarcinoma . Therefore , the first studies on the efficacy of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in second-line treatment ( BR.21 , ISEL , INTEREST ) have shown that an objective response to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI treatment occurs in less than 10 % of patients in the general population [ – ] .	101	119	19 20	sensitivity

Since the introduction of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , patients with metastatic <ANNO_TYPE_gene> positive lung cancer can be offered a therapeutic alternative that has proven its superiority over standard platinum based chemotherapy , . In the EURTAC study , in which erlotinib was compared with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC , erlotinib demonstrated a significant improvement in the overall response rate ( ORR ) and median progression free survival ( PFS ) .

In vitro studies showed that exposing EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines to a mutagen and culturing them in the presence of an EGFR-TKI , the resistant clones with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation maintained a persistent phosphorylation [ ] . Given this role of persistent EGFR signaling , many trials evaluated the intensification of EGFR inhibition through the use of drug molecules with additional activity against other receptors in the EGFR family , as the second-generation neratinib , dacomitinib and afatinib [ ] . These inhibitors are mainly different from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib for two features : each forms a covalent and irreversible attachment to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain , and each also inhibits other members of the ERBB family ( Figure ) .	88	104	29	resistance or non-response

In 2004 , EGFR gene mutations were firstly identified : classical activating EGFR mutations are localized in exon 19 , mainly consisting of an in-frame deletion ( 45-50 % ) , and in exon 21 , consisting of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation ( 40-45 % ) , even if there are less common mutations localized in other exons [ – ] . Since their identification , it was clear that EGFR mutations , more frequently observed in never smokers , adenocarcinoma histology , women and Asiatic patients , outline a distinct subgroup of NSCLC . During the last years , six phase III trials ( Table ) established that patients harboring activating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations benefit more from a first line treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or gefitinib , than from standard chemotherapy , at least in terms of response rate ( RR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) and quality of life [ – ] .	133	112	39	sensitivity

Interestingly , it was discovered that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation does not confer resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by preventing their binding as originally thought .

The dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR might be advantageous over single inhibition by suppressing a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> feedback loop that leads to the pathway reactivation . Based on this idea , an on-going phase I study of the PI3K and mTORC1/2 dual inhibitor , BEZ235 , was designed for the patients with advanced solid tumors harboring <ANNO_TYPE_gene> or PTEN alteration ( NCT01195376 ) . In this study , we showed that the survival of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> SCLC cell lines was well suppressed by BEZ235 , accompanied by the suppression of S6RP phosphorylation .	75	56	16	None

In fact , the pleiotropic effect of BCR/ABL transformation is mostly dependent on post-translational modifications ( e.g. phosphorylation ) of signalling molecules , like those involved in the RAS/MAPK , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and STATs pathways , which control cell growth , survival and differentiation of haematopoietic cells by modulating the expression and/or activity of downstream effectors ( ; ) ( ) . Being the deregulated BCR/ABL kinase activity the cause of CML , targeting its catalytic domain was the most rationale approach for the rational development of small molecules that inhibit ABL kinase activity . In these CML-BC patients , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance often depends on reactivation of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase activity via mechanisms involving BCR/ABL overexpression , gene amplification or mutations that suppress imatinib mediated kinase inhibition ( i.e. E255V and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) or disrupt imatinib binding ( i.e. T315I ) ( ) .	99	30	130	None

In contrast to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , 300 nM ponatinib inhibited phosphorylation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα to a similar degree as 1000 nM sorafenib ( Figure A ) .

We speculated that cells expressing higher EGFR/HER2 ratios , such as A431 cells , rely more on EGFR signalling for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway activation and cell proliferation , whereas cells with a lower EGFR/HER2 ratio , such as C33A cells , depend more on EGFR/HER2 heterodimer signalling . Based on this assumption , the inhibition of the EGFR/HER2 heterodimer by anti-EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) and anti-HER2 ( trastuzumab ) MAbs should interfere with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell proliferation .	61	20	72	None

In another phase II POCHER trial , the proportion of R0 resection was even higher ; it was achieved in 60 % of patients who were treated with chronomodulated chemotherapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , oxaliplatin , 5- fluorouracil and leucovorin . In conclusion , the results of our retrospective study showed that the patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation had worse prognosis than those with wt-BRAF , with lower response rates and progressed early during systemic treatment , consequently , with less possibilities to achieve resectability of metastatic disease .	31	54	55	None
In our retrospective study , 26.7 % of patients , all with KRAS wild-type tumours , who had previously unresectable liver-only metastases , underwent surgical resection after systemic therapy , with R0 resection achieved in 38 patients ( 21.6 % ) ; one of those was patient with the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Although it is difficult to make any comparison , because our patients were not selected according to specific systemic therapy , these results are comparable with those reported in previous studies claiming that 19 to 23 % patients treated with bevacizumab- and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based chemotherapy and with previously unresectable liver-only metastases underwent resection.– In a recently published clinical study BOXER , where the patients with unresectable liver-only metastases were treated with oxaliplatin , capecitabine and bevacizumab , R0 resection was achieved in 40 % of patients .	95	49	50	None
In studies by a different research group which were aimed at determining the mechanism of resistance of breast cancer cells containing the HER2 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation to lapatinib , it was shown that the cells overexpressed EGFR ligands [ ] .

Overexpression of both the wild-type and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> forms of BCRP conferred resistance to 9-aminocamptothecin , which was associated with reduced intracellular drug accumulation , but did not confer resistance to 9-nitrocamptothecin . These observations , in addition to the knowledge that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> confers resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and SN-38 , suggest that polar residues at the 9 or 10 position of camptothecin may be important to facilitate interactions with BCRP .	45	41	6	None
Recently , genome-wide screening for the genetic determinants of gout found that an SNP of ABCG2/BCRP ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is associated with high uric acid levels , and demonstrated that uric acid is a natural substrate of ABCG2/BCRP. , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> also appears to play a protective role against xenobiotics and their metabolites. , The typical ABCG2/BCRP substrates , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and SN-38 , are detoxified by glucuronidation with uridine-diphosphate–glucuronyltransferase , and ABCG2/BCRP can extrude SN-38–glucuronide .	58	39	17	None

Notably , regorafenib significantly enhanced SHP-1 activity in wild-type SHP-1 transfected cells , but not in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or dN1 mutant SHP-1 transfected cells ( Figure ) , suggesting that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> increases <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activity by direct disruption of the association between the N-SH2 domain and the PTP catalytic domain .	29	31	16	None
In addition to upregulation of IGF1R and VEGF , frequent CN gain and increased mRNA expression of GSTT1 as well as significant overexpression of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> subfamily members were observed in wild-type/PDGFRA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> GISTs compared to KIT-mutant GISTs . CN gain of GSTT1 was closely associated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance .	46	24	31	None
In the cell proliferation and malignancy of MCF7 and SUM149 breast cancer cells , Src dependent ( i.e. , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) Y845 phosphorylation ( i.e. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation-sensitive ) signaling was shown to require the activity of p38 MAPK , but not the activity of the EGFR/kinase ERK/MAPK , as well as Akt [ ] . ROS that are produced by colchicine and nocodazole , both of which disrupt microtubules , have also been reported to promote Y845 phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells , R22 , by which ERK/MAPK signaling is triggered to activate <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( PAI-1 ) expression [ ] .	19	95 96 97	26	None

Several studies have reported renal failure and tumor lysis syndrome during TKI based molecular targeted therapies , including with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma , with imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia , and with flavopiridol for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.– Because <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant of ABCG2/BCRP corresponding to SNP 421C&gt ; A reduces uric acid transport and those TKIs are substrates/inhibitors of ABCG2/BCRP , TKI therapy in patients with the SNP 421C&gt ; A ( Q141K ) may be at higher risk of tumor lysis syndrome . A defect in the pharmacological interaction has been suggested between sunitinib and another ABCG2/BCRP germ-line mutant allele , 1291T & gt ; C. Remarkably , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> reversed wild-type ABCG2/BCRP mediated drug resistance and competitively inhibited <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mediated estrone 3-sulfate transport and the binding of 125I-iodoarylazidoprazosin to ABCG2/BCRP .	110	120	39 40	None

These cells lines are different in K-RAS and B-RAF pathways , as HT-29 harbors the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> B-Raf heterozygotic mutation [ ] , SW-480 which harbors K-Ras mutation and Caco-2 is K-Ras and B-Raf wild type . The association between the expression of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and the presence/absence of K-Ras and B-Raf mutations in response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> supports their possible apoptotic function and helps to understand the action mechanism of this drug .	54	42	15	None

Some of the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance include T790M second mutation , mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ( MET ) amplification , ATP binding cassette (ABC)-G2 transporter ( ABCG2 ) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) overexpression , insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein-3 ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) downregulation , as well as ERBB3 activation . T790M mutation The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> second mutation accounts for half of all resistances to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib [ ] .	67	44	57	None
Thus , decreased expression of Pcyt2 likely contributed to the observed decrease in PE level in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> null mice . Another study showed that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mRNA was reduced in a mouse model of Wilsone disease , a severe metabolic disorder characterized by significant liver damage caused by genetic inactivation of copper-transporter , ATP7B [ ] .

In mammals , mTOR associates with mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 ( mLST8 ) , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> AKT substrate of 40 kDa ( AKT1S1 ) and regulatory associated protein of mTOR ( RAPTOR ) to form the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) . The mTORC1 activates protein synthesis through modulation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and the translational initiation factor eIF-4E binding protein 1 ( 4E-BP1 ) . mTORC1 is acutely sensitive to inhibition by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	16	58	None
Interestingly , CCND1 links all of these genes together both at the TF level ( it is predicted to be targeted by AHR/ARNT , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and PAX9 ) and at the gene level via several interactions . CCND1 was downregulated in response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in our panel of cell lines which is consistent with previous studies [ - ] and which may also be related to its known interactions with our other genes of interest . FOXO3A has been shown to down-regulate CCND1 during cell cycle inhibition [ ] , while Erbb3 receptors are thought to be required to reduce transcription of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated transcription factors , which include CCND1 [ ] .	43	24	102	None
Lazzara and colleagues found that SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation was not induced in response to EGF in the H3255 cells , which harbor the missense <ANNO_TYPE_variant> exon 21 mutation , suggesting that SHP2 activity may be less efficiently promoted by EGFR L858R and the STAT3 pathway may be more active . The main problem is that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation is not abrogated by single EGFR TKI treatment with gefitinib , erlotinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or dacomitinib , - .	70	55	24	None
Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following imatinib .	53	39	123	None
Since previous studies have suggested that a putative NFκB response element ( 5′-GGGRNWYYCC-3′ ) is located at 5′-flanking region of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene , we further evaluated <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> modulates BTG2 through the NFκB pathway in PC-3 cells . These results are in agreement with previous study showing curcumin upregulated BTG2 expression by blocking the NFκB activity in U937 cells , a human leukemic monocyte lymphoma cell line although other early study indicated that NFκB is the activator of BTG2 expression <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells , a human ductal breast epithelial tumor cell line .	26 27	20	80 81	None

Further transient gene expression assays showed cisplatin treatment lost the activation on BTG2 promoter activity when the NFκB response element was mutated from GGAAAGTCC to GGAAAGGAA in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> reporter vector , confirming <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> upregulated BTG2 expression through the NFκB pathway in PC-3 cells .	88 89	83	42 43	None

The EnzChek Caspase-3 fluorescent assay was used to determine the protease activity of caspase-3 in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells in the presence and absence of 40 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> pretreatment ( 16 hrs ) followed by induction of apoptosis using 0.8 mg/ml of Rec-1 or Enol-1 for 8 , 16 , and 24 hrs .	26 27	17	15	None
Poziotinib ( also known as HM781-36B ) , a new potent irreversible inhibitor of EGFR , HER2 , HER4 , and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood family of kinases inhibitor ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , BLK , and BMX ) , demonstrated preclinical efficacy against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant at eightfold lower doses compared to afatinib . A different approach in addressing EGFR-TKI resistance involves the use of combination regimens . Therefore , the combination of erlotinib with cetuximab , and the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with MM-121 ( a fully human mAb that targets HER3 ) , in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs did not show sufficient clinical activity for further investigation in this population .	79	30	42	None

This mutation then also bypasses the requirement of a functional <ANNO_TYPE_gene> protein in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity as expression of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in the lof rab-3 genetic background eliminates the rab-3 phenotype .	13	10	18	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( also named Velcade , PS-341 , Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Cambridge , MA , USA ) and imatinib mesylate ( also named Gleevec , STI-571 , Novartis , Basel , Switzerland ) were purchased from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Pharmacy ( approved for research purposes only ) . The sensitivity of K562 , K562-R , LAMA84 , LAMA84-R , Baf3 <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and Baf3 Bcr-Abl <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell lines to the most used Bcr-Abl inhibitors in CML : imatinib , dasatinib ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , CA , USA , Cat. # sc-218081 ) and nilotinib ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , CA , USA , Cat. # sc-202245 ) was investigated by treating these cells with increasing concentrations of each drug and measuring cell death using an automated Trypan Blue exclusion method ( see ) .	0	63	68	None
In conclusion , the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and mitotic inhibitors such as paclitaxel , docetaxel , vincristine or BI 2536 is an effective strategy for targeting of both TKIs -resistant and -sensitive Bcr-Abl positive leukemic cells . These regimens are able to inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activity and its downstream signaling , and to activate caspase dependent cell death . In addition , these regimens are able to overcome the resistance to imatinib , dasatinib and nilotinib , brought about by Bcr-Abl protein overexpression or Bcr-Abl mutations ( including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , making them attractive potential therapies for Bcr-Abl positive leukemias such as CML , especially for those resistant to current treatments .	6	43	87	None
Soon after the advent of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI imatinib , it became evident that Philadelphia chromosome–positive cells could evolve to evade inhibition . In particular , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutant – the most commonly observed point mutation in clinical practice – confers universal resistance to these agents.– At present , the only TKI that is effective in patients with the T315I mutation <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ARIAD Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , Cambridge , MA , USA ) .	62 63	6	27	None
Preliminary results from an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study of the multikinase , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( AP24534 ) showed antileukemic activity in patients with refractory CML , including patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	14 15	13	31 32	None
We found that inhibition of MET signaling with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> siRNA induced apoptosis that was accompanied by attenuation of the phosphorylation ( activation ) of AKT and the MAPK extracellular signal regulated kinase ( ERK ) in NSCLC cells with MET amplification but not in those positive for a non-kinase domain mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or deletion of exon 14 ) of MET [ ] .	8	10	54	None
In the case of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , the median PFS in the PROFILE studies was 7.7 months . Similarly , in EGFR mutated tumors , the efficacy of TKIs is limited by the development of resistance mechanisms , the commonest of which is the secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation within exon 20 of the EGFR gene. , The presence of T790M gatekeeper resistance resulting in failure of treatment accounts for about 50 % of secondary resistance with other mechanisms including activation of bypass mechanisms such as amplification of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and transformation into small-cell lung cancer .	4	86 87	44	None
Moreover , no concurrent KRAS mutations are known to exist in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplified patients who have responded to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] , but only limited molecular testing was performed on these tumors . Dual MET amplified , KRAS mutated tumors have been identified at a low frequency in the TCGA database ( February 2014 ) as 1 of 230 NSCLC harboring concurrent MET amplification and KRAS G12V and 1 of 219 stomach adenocarcinoma harboring MET amplification and KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	18	11	79	None

Patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> KRAS mutant tumors and treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> regimes had overall survival and progression free survival of average 7.6 and 4.0 mo vs. 5.7 and 1.9 mo in other KRAS mutant tumor subtypes .	9	2	2	None
This year at ASCO , Tejpar et al. further supported this finding by presenting retrospective analyses of two large phase III multicenter trials ( CRYSTAL and OPUS ) representing 83 patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> KRAS mutant mCRC tumors who had longer overall survival and progression free survival on average post <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment then other KRAS mutant subtypes .	49	32	32	None
In a study by De Roock et al. , a pooled data set of 579 mCRC patients across various clinical trials treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> plus/minus chemotherapy demonstrated that overall and progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> KRAS mutant tumors .	23	38	38	None
However these studies were small , with only 32 and 83 patients , respectively , with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . On the other hand , a number of studies have demonstrated no benefit for either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab by specific KRAS mutations .	35	17	17	None
Recent data have suggested that tumors with specific KRAS mutations , especially the glycine-to-aspartate mutation in codon 13 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) mutation , may be sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or panitumumab .	27	19	19	None
BRAF mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) were present in 12 % of the tumors . The mutational frequencies of the 195 KRAS mutations in the NORDIC VII cohort were ; G12A ( 9.7 % ) , G12R ( 1.5 % ) , G12D ( 35.4 % ) , G12C ( 9.7 % ) , G12S ( 6.2 % ) , G12V ( 15.4 % ) , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( 22.1 % ) . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> did not add significant benefit to Nordic FLOX and KRAS mutation was not predictive for cetuximab effect .	72	66	3	None

This was confirmed in vitro , and G12V mutated cancer cells were resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , whereas <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated and KRAS wild-type cancer cells were sensitive .	14	17	17	None
It has even been observed that cells that have been induced to become <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by continuously exposing them to cetuximab have acquired either K-Ras G12V or K-Ras <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations [ ] . Moreover , in a large retrospective study of patients treated with panitumumab , the outcome in patients with the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation was not better than other KRas mutations .	13	51	27	None
Gatekeeper mutations have been found in many kinase-driven tumors that develop resistance to kinase inhibitor treatment ( e.g. , CML patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> that develop the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation in BCR-ABL ) . Two potential mechanisms could explain how the EGFR T790M mutation confers <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI resistance .	23	45	27	None
One possibility is that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation could lead to altered drug binding in the ATP pocket of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in a manner analogous to the effects of the T315I mutation in the ABL kinase in the context of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance [ ] .	38	18	5	None

It was initially proposed that the T790M mutation might prevent the proper binding of tyrosine kinase inhibitors via steric hindrance , similar to the corresponding gatekeeper mutations in BCR-ABL ( T315I ) and KIT ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) that confer resistance to imatinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors . Interestingly , it was discovered that the T790M mutation does not confer resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib by preventing their binding as originally thought . Instead , the T790M mutation induces resistance by increasing the binding affinity of ATP by one order of magnitude , which is near the affinity for wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , thus enabling ATP to compete effectively with the kinase inhibitors .	43	109	35	None

The presence of a secondary mutation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene in the T790M was reported in 2005 .

Since tumor specimens from three additional patients with acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not demonstrate the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , this specific lesion does not account for all mechanisms of acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib . Given the paradigm established with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , other drug-resistance mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , either within or outside the tyrosine kinase domain , are likely to exist .	44	50	19	None
Similar to mutations in BCR-ABL ( T315I ) or in KIT ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) that underlie resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , T790M is thought to interfere with the binding of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> at the adenosine triphosphate binding cleft of EGFR . , , On the other hand , the affinity of this cleft for adenosine triphosphate is increased by T790M .	18	29	12	None
The functional relevance of restoration of NKG2D–NKG2DL interaction by gefitinib was demonstrated by the enhanced cytotoxicity , degranulation and IFN-γ production of NK cells in response to lung cancer cells with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> L858R <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation . Recently , immune system has been demonstrated to contribute substantially to the antitumor effects of small molecule inhibitors .

Y253H , E255K , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> were deemed less sensitive , but not inherently resistant , as was the T315I identified in three patients receiving nilotinib . Six of 16 imatinib treated patients ( 38 % ) with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations progressed to accelerated phase/blast crisis CML , as compared with 1/13 ( 8 % ) of nilotinib treated patients . Investigators at MD Anderson Cancer Center also recently presented their institutional history with nilotinib ( n = 90 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( n = 82 ) used in frontline CML therapy or for accelerated phase CML patients who had not been previously treated .	80	38	5	None

When considering a change in therapy , it is important to consider a BCR-ABL kinase domain mutational analysis. [ ] <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation T315I is resistant to all of the currently approved TKIs . Some mutations ( Y253H , E255K/V , and F359V/C ) are less sensitive to nilotinib , and others ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and V299L ) are less sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	60	20	52	None

Dasatinib is a dual SRC/ABL1 inhibitor that also inhibits PDGFRs and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion but has no effect on imatinib-resistant FIP1L1-PDGFRA T674I and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants . Third generation of TKIs : ponatinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has a potent activity towards BCR-ABL1 , as well as numerous imatinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain mutants , including the T315I mutation .	31	44	22	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with mutations , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> + + Sen et al	0	1	6	None
It is also active against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and other imatinib-resistant mutants . However , not all CML patients who are refractory or intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib are responsive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . We have shown that the resistance of leukemia stem cells to imatinib does not appear to involve BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations , suggesting that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activates some signaling pathways in a kinase independent manner in leukemia stem cells .	29	55	5	None
Preliminary results from an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study of the multikinase , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( AP24534 ) showed antileukemic activity in patients with refractory CML , including patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	14 15	13	31 32	None
Another approach for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance is the dual inhibition of EGFR with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and cetuximab , an EGFR blocking antibody resembling the synergistic combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab in ErbB2 positive breast cancer . Due to promising preliminary results of activity and tolerability , final results of this regimen are being eagerly anticipated [ ] . In selected patients with acquisition of resistance by activated compensatory pathways such as MET and AXL , addition of a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] or AXL [ ] inhibitor to EGFR-TKIs could be beneficial .	13	77	3	None
Taken together , these findings indicated that the Met inhibitor crizotinib plus a new generation EGFR-TKI , either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or WZ4002 , circumvented resistance to HGF in an autocrine manner , in the presence or absence of the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene amplification .	18	42	39	None
An additional mechanism is the activation , either at baseline or acquired , of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> over-expression . Afatinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH ) , an irreversible dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 kinases , retains some activity in tumors with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations although at doses that are a log higher than what is needed for cancers with only a sensitizing mutation [ ] .	19 20	14	43	None
These observations could be due to the presence of concurrent drug resistance mechanisms ( such as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification ) , or to the inability of dacomitinib to fully inhibit EGFR in tumors harboring EGFR T790M at the doses currently under clinical investigation . Strategies to improve EGFR inhibition in EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cancers include the combination of irreversible EGFR inhibitors with the EGFR‐directed antibody cetuximab ( as reported <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> plus cetuximab ) 19 ; the development of more potent and specific inhibitors of EGFR T790M20,21 ; and the use of intermittent but high doses of existing irreversible EGFR inhibitors .	67 68	16	50	None
There are several promising agents for patients with activating EGFR mutations who experience disease progression of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and have a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation , and multiple clinical trials will be available . Trials investigating adjuvant erlotinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC and comparing <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to erlotinib plus bevacizumab in metastatic EGFR mutant NSCLC are ongoing . Crizotinib , when compared to platinum pemetrexed , results in a superior ORR and progression-free survival in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> rearranged NSCLC , and ceritinib is a second-line option for this patient population , but patients need to be monitored closely for adverse events and the need for dose reductions .	46	78	24	None

Despite initial sensitivity and responses that in many cases can be maintained over periods of many months or even years , tumors with EGFR mutations or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene rearrangements treated with specific inhibitors will ultimately progress—a process termed acquired resistance . In the case of acquired resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in EGFR mutant tumors two major mechanisms have been identified . Firstly , a secondary mutation , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation within exon 20 of EGFR , is responsible for about 50 % of instances of acquired resistance [ , ] .	50	26	69	None
This agent is also being assessed in a phase II trial in patients with de novo resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations not previously treated with EGFR-TKIs ( www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT01854034 ) and in patients with EGFR mutations and/or EGFR-TKI resistant disease , as part of a phase II cluster study in Chinese patients evaluating five novel inhibitors of HSP90 , PI3K , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , MET , and MEK ( ) . Further , AUY922 is also being assessed in combination with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients who have previously responded to EGFR-TKIs and/or whose tumors harbor activating EGFR mutations ( www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT01259089 ) , with results expected in the near future .	79	60	17	None
The concomitant inhibition of MET and EGFR using the monoclonal antiboby MetMab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> proved to beefficacious in a phase II trial and early clinical trials of small-molecule inhibitors of MET given with EGFR inhibitors are now currently underway ( ) . The combination of crizotinib ( dual c-MET/anaplastic lymphoma kinase <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ] inhibitor ) ( ) and dacomitinib , although in early phase , is particularly interesting since one of its components , dacomitinib , was designed to address the acquired resistance by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation in EGFR .	13	51	85	None
Second-generation EGFR TKIs – such as neratinib , afatinib and dacomitinib – are effective in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> models , but to date their delivery in EGFR TKI-resistant patients have shown disappointing results in the clinic . Combination of afatinib with cetuximab in EGFR TKI-resistant patients resulted in a 30 % response rate and 75 % disease control rate , with significant gastrointestinal toxicity . Other mechanisms of resistance include MET amplification , with no commercially available inhibitor , HER2 amplification potentially amenable to treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> monoclonal antibodies or histological transformation to small-cell lung cancer , which requires cytotoxic chemotherapy .	15 16	89	19 20	None

On performing rebiopsies in 155 patients with lung adenocarcinoma after development of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs , Yu et al showed that 63 % of patients had <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , 13 % had <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification , 5 % had MET amplification , and 3 % had small cell transformation . There is no standard treatment after failure of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	59	34	28	None
Although several previous studies have suggested that tumors harboring mutations in the EGFR kinase domain were sensitive to TKIs such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , others had reported an association between the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 20 and the resistance to TKIs . As we learn more about the relationship between EGFR status ( including gene copy number , mutation status , and mutation type ) and drug sensitivity , decisions about treatment with TKIs for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) become more complex . Previously , we reported <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutational status , as well as EGFR and KRAS , in a large number of NSCLCs .	21	92	32	None
One of these agents , BIBW2992 ( afatinib ) , is able to target both EGFR and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and overcome T790M-driven acquired resistance [ ] . However , in clinical studies , BIBW2992 did not prolong survival compared to placebo in NSCLC patients who have developed acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib [ ] . Another agent in this class of next generation EGFR TKIs , PF-002999804 , inhibits all ERBB family members and has been shown to be effective against tumors harboring <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ , ] .	49	17	83	None
Furthermore , a high response rate ( 60 to 90 % ) to treatment with EGFR-TKIs has been observed in patients harboring mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR , with exon 19 deletions and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutations comprising about 90 % of all mutations [ , ] . Although the mechanism of lethal interstitial pneumonia as a side effect of EGFR-TKI is still unknown , EGFR-TKI can be striking in cancer reduction and quality of life improvement in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR gene mutations . Currently , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> is considered third-line chemotherapy for patients with inoperable and recurrent NSCLC after first-line platinum based combination chemotherapy and second-line chemotherapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ; however , in future the combination of cytotoxic agents and EGFR-TKI may become first- or second-line standard chemotherapy .	120	98	43	None

The estrogen induced activation of PGR , which encodes the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , also increases upon Sin3A knockdown ( Figure ) . PR status is often used as a marker of estrogen sensitivity and predictor of response to endocrine therapy in breast cancer [ , ] . Additionally , knockdown of Sin3A only prevents growth of ERα positive MCF7 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells , not ERα negative MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells , further supporting the notion that components intrinsic to the ERα signaling pathway are involved in mediating the ability of Sin3A to promote survival .	10	10 11 12	60 61	None
Repeat cytology of her right pleural fluid showed adenocarcinoma with an <ANNO_TYPE_gene> exon 19 deletion and a second mutation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> associated with EGFR-TKI resistance .

After this diagnosis , the patient received the three courses of first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel plus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as stage IV ( T4N0M1 ) with lung-to-lung metastasis . Thus , the patient began to take gefitinib at 250 mg/day because <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene analysis in this patient showed a deletion mutation in exon 19 and point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 by direct sequence method ( ) .	16	39	55	None
Some data suggest that patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions are more susceptible to the activity of reversible EGFR-TKIs compared to those with the exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation. , Further studies then compared first-generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( erlotinib and gefitinib ) to chemotherapy in patients with EGFR activating mutations in advanced NSCLC . In the first-line setting , a European randomized trial , EURTAC , compared erlotinib 150 mg daily to platinum containing chemotherapy regimens ( cisplatin or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with docetaxel or gemcitabine ) in 174 patients with advanced NSCLC .	77	34	26	None
<ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was detected in exon 21 ( PNA LNA PCR-Clamp method ) of another brushing and aspiration specimen .

Meanwhile , NVP-BEZ235 showed greater antiproliferative activity than the allosteric selective <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in all cancer cell lines tested . In a xenograft model of BT474 derived breast cancer cells overexpressing either the p110α H1047R oncogenic mutation or the empty vector , NVP-BEZ235 significantly inhibited tumor growth of both xenografts . Consistently , NVP-BEZ235 at nanomolar concentrations suppressed phosphorylation of Akt , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and 4E-BP1 and inhibited cell growth in a panel of cancer cells , including myeloma cells , as well as human glioma , osteosarcoma , Ewing 's sarcoma , and rhabdomyosarcoma .	13	11	63	None
Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) and Wnt pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( T315I ) following imatinib . Although the MET <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation renders cancers insensitive to type I MET inhibitors , conformal differences between these and type II compounds may allow treatment of MET Y1230H mutant cancers or prevent the emergence of resistance due to the mutation. ,	53	33 34 35 36	131	None
In xenografts derived from the breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the pancreatic carcinoid cell line BON , both harboring an activating PIK3CA mutation , treatment with the allosteric <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor Rapamycin ( Sirolimus ) was associated with a significant decrease in tumor volume ( Meric-Bernstam et al. , ) . Moreover , using PIK3CA wild-type human breast immortalized epithelial cells ( hTERT-HME1 ) or non-malignant MCF10A breast cells , knock-in of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or H1047R PIK3CA mutant alleles sensitized non transformed human breast cells to the rapalog <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Di Nicolantonio et al. , ) .	88	29	73	None
Given the prevalence of activation of the PI3K/mTOR axis and BRAF V600E mutations in pediatric tumors , we designed a pre-clinical study to determine whether inhibitors of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and of BRAF V600E cooperate to enhance cytotoxicity specifically in pediatric low-grade gliomas . In an in vivo flank model of a pediatric pilocytic astrocytoma , subcutaneous xenografts of BT40 ( which carries a BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ) were treated with vehicle , PLX4720 , everolimus , or combination of PLX4720 + <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and the outcome measures of tumor size and animal survival were followed .	80	27	63	None
When cross-over to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was examined , 75 % of patients who received cisplatin and pemetrexed received an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and 56 % of patients who received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gemcitabine received an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor .

Two phase III trials compared afatinib to a platinum-doublet in patients with advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC , and a combined analysis for overall survival was presented at ASCO , as well as subset analyses based on EGFR mutation subtype ( exon 19 deletion and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation ) [ ] . In subgroup analysis based on EGFR mutation type the benefit appeared to be limited to patients with exon 19 mutations . When cross-over to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was examined , 75 % of patients who received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and pemetrexed received an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and 56 % of patients who received cisplatin and gemcitabine received an <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase inhibitor .	91	112	46	None

For example , large phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that ADC is a strong predictive factor for improved outcome following treatment with the combination of pemetrexed with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> compared with SQC [ ] . In addition , the presence of common activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene ( exon 19 deletion and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ) confers strong sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib , which are selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ , ] .	28	82	64	None

The patient received 4 courses of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based chemotherapy and the response was evaluated as partial . Two months following the completion of chemotherapy , the patient developed dyspnea on exertion due to reaccumulation of left pleural fluid and the cytological pleural fluid specimens showed an <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation in exon 21 ) .	6	46	49	None
A diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma was determined and the patient was treated with first-line chemotherapy consisting of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 80 mg/m2 ) and docetaxel ( 60 mg/m2 ) , every three weeks for up to three cycles . However , no marked response was observed . Following the initial treatment , a mutation in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene was identified ( exon 21 ; <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , in which the leucine at amino acid position 858 is replaced by arginine ; ) .	17	55	63	None
Although several previous studies have suggested that tumors harboring mutations in the EGFR kinase domain were sensitive to TKIs such as gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , others had reported an association between the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 20 and the resistance to TKIs . As we learn more about the relationship between EGFR status ( including gene copy number , mutation status , and mutation type ) and drug sensitivity , decisions about treatment with TKIs for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) become more complex . Previously , we reported <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutational status , as well as EGFR and KRAS , in a large number of NSCLCs .	23	92	32	None
Possible mechanisms of acquired or secondary resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> include second mutations in the EGFR gene such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , activation of an alternative pathway including Met or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification , histological transformation to small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) and epithelial to mesenchymal transition [ ] .	8	28	18	None
Interestingly , cells with these mutations also showed greater sensitivity to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than cells with the EGFR mutation ( exon 19 deletion ) , which are associated with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC . Mutations in PI3K ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) have been shown to enhance <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mediated transformation by amplifying the ligand induced signaling output of the HER family of RTKs [ ] .	13	48	41	None
In vitro analyses identified three point mutations , L755S , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and T798M to confer resistance to lapatinib ( Kancha et al. , ) . Threonine 798 is the ERBB2 “gatekeeper” residue that is located at the periphery of the nucleotide binding site of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase ( Aertgeerts et al. , ) , and regulates access to a deep hydrophobic pocket in the active site ( Schindler et al. , ) . This event is analogous to replacement of threonine 790 with methionine ( T790M ) in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> lung adenocarcinoma .	88	45	10	None

Viability experiments were performed once and representative curves are shown ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was not evaluated because <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells expressing this mutant could not be established ) . Similarly , motesanib inhibited autophosphorylation of the imatinib-resistant activation loop mutant Y823 D ( IC50 = 64 nM ) more potently than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( IC50 & gt ; 3000 nM ) ( Table : Figure ) .	49	16	11	None
We next tested whether <ANNO_TYPE_drug> could induce PRL-3 protein down-regulation in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> murine hematopoietic cells engineered to express either wild-type , or the Imatinib resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant P210 BCR-ABL .	4	11	25	None
Vo n Bubnoff et al reported that nilotinib suppresses the growth of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells transfected with the T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutant .

To investigate the effects of AZD0530 on Bcr-Abl harbouring mutations conferring <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Y253F , E255K and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutants were treated with the dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor AZD0530 , and proliferation was assessed comparing them with the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> infected p185Bcr-Abl cells treated in a similar manner ( Figure ) .	11	42	17	None
The EGFR mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> has to our knowledge not previously been described in the literature , but given its proximity to mutations known to be sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( L858R and L861X ) , tumor clones bearing the L862R mutation could also be potentially responsive to EGFR-TKI . Meanwhile , because of rapid worsening while waiting for these new molecular tests the patient received third-line <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , showing further progression in abdomen and pelvis , but still no sign of relapse in the thorax .	65	27	3	None
The LUX-LUNG 3 study [ ] , a multicenter , randomized , open-label phase III study compared afatinib with cisplatin plus <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients with lung adenocarcinoma , stage IIIb/IV harboring <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations [ , ] . Among the 1,269 screened patients , 345 resulted eligible and were randomized in a two-to-one fashion to afatinib 40 mg daily or chemotherapy up to a maximum of six cycles ( without any maintenance therapy ) . As expected , patients were mainly East Asian , never-smokers and women ; EGFR mutations were predominantly exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutations .	21	31	95	None
Repeat cytology of her right pleural fluid showed adenocarcinoma with an EGFR exon 19 deletion and a second mutation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> associated with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> resistance .

Several compounds ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , PLX4720 , and GDC-0879 ) which selectively inhibit the kinase enzyme BRAF containing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation are in clinical development [ ] . In BRAF mutant cancer cell lines , these selective BRAF inhibitors potently block <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signaling .	3	41	19	None
Some MEK1 mutations , including the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation identified in a patient 's AZD6244-resistant melanoma , also led to cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors , presumably by causing activation of MEK downstream of BRAF . Interestingly , later work by this same group identified a different MEK1 point mutation ( C121S ) in a post-relapse biopsy from a patient with clinically acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , demonstrating that MEK1 mutations can arise as a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors as well [ ] . Interestingly , although the MEK1 P124L point mutation conferred resistance to MEK or BRAF inhibitors alone , the combination of a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor and BRAF inhibitor could overcome resistance in this setting .	66	110	6	None
BRAF V600E mutation leads to constitutive activation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway , promoting cancer cell survival and proliferation [ ] . In the current study , significant downregulation of mRNA expression of BRAF V600E was observed for human melanoma SK-MEL-28 cells treated with α-mangostin , γ-mangostin , and 8-deoxygartanin ( ) . RG7204 ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) , a selective BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> inhibitor , has potent inhibitory effects on the growth of melanoma harboring this mutation both in vitro and in vivo [ ] .	54	9	60	None
Another approach for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance is the dual inhibition of EGFR with afatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , an EGFR blocking antibody resembling the synergistic combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab in ErbB2 positive breast cancer . Due to promising preliminary results of activity and tolerability , final results of this regimen are being eagerly anticipated [ ] . In selected patients with acquisition of resistance by activated compensatory pathways such as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and AXL , addition of a MET [ ] or AXL [ ] inhibitor to EGFR-TKIs could be beneficial .	15	70	3	None
Second-generation EGFR TKIs – such as neratinib , afatinib and dacomitinib – are effective in preclinical gefitinib- and erlotinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> models , but to date their delivery in EGFR TKI-resistant patients have shown disappointing results in the clinic . Combination of afatinib with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in EGFR TKI-resistant patients resulted in a 30 % response rate and 75 % disease control rate , with significant gastrointestinal toxicity . Other mechanisms of resistance include <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification , with no commercially available inhibitor , HER2 amplification potentially amenable to treatment with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies or histological transformation to small-cell lung cancer , which requires cytotoxic chemotherapy .	44	73	19 20	None
Genetic mutations of some common oncogenes associated with EGFR pathway , e.g . KRAS , BRAF ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , EGFR , AKT and PI3KC have also been investigated in these models by hot-spot mutation sequencing . Therefore , the non-response of GC xenografts to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> apparently can not be simply attributed to these oncogene mutations .	47	20	17	None

As it was shown previously , the sensitivity of Co(III)- and Pt ( II ) TPP towards aliphatic alcohols decreases in a following order [ ] : <ANNO_TYPE_drug> & gt ; methanol & gt ; isobutyl alcohol ; while in [ and ] the response of 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl porphyrin ( H2TPP ) and its Co(II) complexes based sensors , towards the changes in acetic acid , ethanol , ammonia , NaCl , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , quinine , glucose , monosodium glutamate , dissolved SO2 , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> content was evolved .	27	71	84	None
The DNA in the water phase was subsequently <ANNO_TYPE_drug> precipitated . After centrifugation , the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mM <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and 10 mM EDTA ( pH 8.0 ) , and frozen at −20 °C until further analysis .

Previous studies showed that Ile , Met , and several non-standard amino acids could be misactivated by LeuRS in vitro , and further charged to tRNALeu by editing defective mutants such as E. coli LeuRS ( EcLeuRS ) <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , yielding mischarged tRNALeu . Therefore , SptRNALeu was methionylated at 37°C in a 300-μL volume containing 100 mM <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( pH 7.8 ) , 30 mM KCl , 12 mM MgCl2 , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 4 mM ATP , 40 μM [ 3H ] Met , 20 μM purified SptRNALeu , and 0.5 μM EcLeuRS-D345A mutant for 30 min .

Furthermore , both G719S and G724S mutants undergo constitutive tyrosine-phosphorylation , which is further increased by EGF treatment , whereas phosphorylation of wild-type EGFR requires induction by <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( Additional file : Figure S2B ) . These data demonstrate that colon-cancer derived G719S and G724S mutants are oncogenically active in the absence of ligand stimulation . To test whether G719S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutants are <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in vitro , we ectopically expressed these mutants in Ba/F3 cells , rendering these cells IL-3 independent but dependent on exogenous oncogenic EGFR signaling [ ] .	65	27	61	None

Because tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib was effective for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation cells , we also compared the inhibitory effect of DCC-2036 with sorafenib in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells .	8	26	9 10	None
Poziotinib ( also known as HM781-36B ) , a new potent irreversible inhibitor of EGFR , HER2 , HER4 , and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood family of kinases inhibitor ( BTK , BLK , and BMX ) , demonstrated preclinical efficacy against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant at eightfold lower doses compared to afatinib . A different approach in addressing EGFR-TKI resistance involves the use of combination regimens . Therefore , the combination of erlotinib with cetuximab , and the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with MM-121 ( a fully human mAb that targets <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) , in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs did not show sufficient clinical activity for further investigation in this population .	79	89	42	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation reviewed in . The second well-known mechanism of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance is the MET receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) gene amplification . MET creates a bypass signaling track that activates AKT through <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mediated activation of PI3K in the presence of EGFR TKIs .	10	34	0	None
The remaining members of the HER family comprise HER2 and HER4 tyrosine kinases , and the kinase‐null <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .1 HER family members act together via hetero‐ and homodimerization to enable downstream signaling pathways modulating a range of cellular activities , including growth , proliferation , differentiation , and migration . In contrast to patients with EGFR‐mutation‐positive tumors , patients with KRAS‐mutant NSCLC are unlikely to respond to gefitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and do not have an improved progression‐free survival ( PFS ) compared with those who have placebo following erlotinib therapy . Dacomitinib ( PF‐00299804 ) is a potent , irreversible , oral small‐molecule inhibitor of HER1/EGFR , HER2 , and HER4 tyrosine kinases with antitumor activity in both gefitinib‐sensitive and gefitinib‐resistant , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , preclinical NSCLC models .	68 69	17	123 124	None
Primary results from the EMILIA study , a randomized trial comparing Trastuzumab DM-1 to lapatinib and capecitabine , have shown that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> DM-1 significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer .

In breast cancer cell line studies , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation markedly increased resistance to microtubule directed agents as well as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and tamoxifen treatment [ , ] .

Mouse monoclonal Abs against CD16 ( 3G8 ) and CD54 ( HCD54 ) ( BioLegend , San Diego , CA ) and CD11a ( Ancell , North Bayport , MN ) , rabbit monoclonal Abs against HER2 ( D8F12 ) , phospho-HER2 ( 6B12 ) and phospho-Akt ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , and rat monoclonal Ab against CD18 ( YFC118.3 ) ( Chemicon International , Temecula , CA ) are also commercially available .	0	36	114	None
While the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation represents a direct mechanism for drug resistance that occurs at the level of drug accessibility to the target , there are a number of indirect mechanisms that involve the increased expression or activation of alternative growth factor receptors to maintain signal flux , despite EGFR inhibition . Perhaps the best characterized of these is the amplification of the Met receptor and/or elevated levels of its ligand HGF . In <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant NSCLC cell lines , Met drives <ANNO_TYPE_gene> dependent activation of the PI3K pathway .	73	81	2	None
Although the resistant cell line HCG827GR does not have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , it was found to have MET amplification . MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is associated with the development of various human cancers . Therefore , EGFR-TKIs fail to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway dependent growth signal because the constitutive phosphorylation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> by MET occurs independent of EGFR activation , which causes the cells to acquire resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	63	11	None
The remaining members of the HER family comprise HER2 and HER4 tyrosine kinases , and the kinase‐null <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .1 HER family members act together via hetero‐ and homodimerization to enable downstream signaling pathways modulating a range of cellular activities , including growth , proliferation , differentiation , and migration .

Dacomitinib ( PF‐00299804 ) is a potent , irreversible , oral small‐molecule inhibitor of HER1/EGFR , HER2 , and HER4 tyrosine kinases with antitumor activity in both gefitinib‐sensitive and gefitinib‐resistant , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , preclinical NSCLC models .	66 67	17	123 124	None
One important issue raised by this case concerns acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Recent data have shown that almost all patients with known EGFR mutations who initially respond to TKIs , subsequently become resistant due to emergence of mutations , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( in 50 % of cases ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> overexpression .	11	51	42	None
The emergence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR gatekeeper mutation and up-regulation of downstream signaling by MET amplification have been described as the two main mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance . However a phase III trial enrolling only patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> positive tumors was stopped in early March 2014 due to futility ; there was no evidence to suggest a positive effect of addition of onartuzumab to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	65	38	4	None
For example , HCC827 cells undergo <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification and AXL induction upon adaption to gefitinib , , , and PC9 cells acquire the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR that confers resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib .	31	6	23	None
As would be predicted from the prior studies cited above , miR-7 blunted <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signaling and reversed the radio-resistance . Correspondingly , direct injection of a liposome encapsulated miR-7 plasmid into established EGFR-TKI sensitive and resistant tumors bearing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutant resulted in significant tumor regression in conjunction with repression of EGFR , RAF-1 and IRS-1 expression . In head and neck cancer , miR-7 functioned in a synergistic manner with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to render FaDu Erlotinib-resistant cells susceptible to the growth inhibitory activities of the drug .	72	13	39	None

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib belong to the first generation of TKIs and have reversible binding features . The principal predictive factor for response to such drugs is the presence of somatic “activating” mutations in the EGFR gene that cause an aberrant and constitutive activation of the receptor at the membrane level , resulting in a growth advantage of tumor cells through the activation of Ras/MAPK , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and STAT signaling pathways . In about 50 % of cases , a secondary mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is supposed to be responsible for resistance. , Other mechanisms involve MET gene amplification ( 5 % –20 % ) ,	0	65	83	None
Therefore , PTEN downregulation or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation may be one of the mechanisms for acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . 2. Acquired resistance mechanism 1 ) Secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of the EGFR gene	17	5	26	None
Consequently , inhibition of mTORC1 releases the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated negative feedback loop , resulting in a paradoxical increase of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and Akt activity . Therefore , there is legitimate concern that the efficacy of selective mTORC1 inhibitors , which include rapamycin and its analogs ( rapalogs ) , eg , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , is limited .	50	19	7	None
BeZ235 is an inhibitor of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and mTOR , and its inhibitory effect on the growth of NSCLC cells and tumor xenografts can be strengthened by mTORC1 inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , . The synergistic effect was interpreted by the uncouple feedback inhibition between <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and PI3K .	28	5	42	None
Inhibition of TORC1 and downstream <ANNO_TYPE_variant> with the rapalog <ANNO_TYPE_drug> derepresses levels of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 expression leading to activation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and phosphorylation of AKT at S473 in both cancer cell lines and tumors of patients [ - ] .	9	22	5	None

Through this approach , they showed that Src Family Kinases (SFKs) , as well as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , are relevant targets for the Src inhibitor dasatinib and that acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations render cells resistant not only to erlotinib and gefitinib , but also to dasatinib [ ] . In a recent report , human glioblastoma cells have been transduced with retroviruses encoding Notch delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) , grown as tumor xenografts and then treated with the anti-VEGF mAb <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	78	15	28	None
The data suggest that low BRCA1 level may neutralize the negative effects of the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity and that high BRCA1 expression may lead to de novo EGFR TKI resistance potentially through increased DNA damage repair capacity [ ] . In addition to EGFR T790M , primary EGFR TKI resistance may also be due to other secondary mutations in EGFR ( e.g. , D761Y ) that occur in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with an activating EGFR kinase domain mutation ( e.g. , L858R ) [ ] .	18	71	15	None
The cell line H1975 has a sensitizing L858R kinase domain mutation in exon 21 , but also a second mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , in the kinase domain ) rendering them resistant to the reversible TKIs gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	40	24	21	None
It is possible to conceive that an increase in the clinical doses of gefitinib or switching to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which is given at its maximal tolerated dose [ ] , may lead to beneficial clinical effects , possibly by increasing BIM expression , in patients with EGFR mutations who acquired L747S after exposure to gefitinib . The data presented here indicate that BIM is both a marker and an effector of TKI induced apoptosis in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells . Furthermore , we identified a novel acquired EGFR secondary mutation , L747S , and showed that both the L747S and the common T790M in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> to an activating EGFR mutation ( either <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or an exon 19 deletion ) cause resistance to EGFR TKI induced apoptosis and attenuate the up-regulation of BIM .	17	103	111	None
They described a 3.5-fold greater mean increase in log transformed PC20 for methacholine in asthmatic children with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> variants compared to those homozygous for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> 33 TBX21 rs2240017 after 4 years of treatment with ICS . However , the allele frequency of the minor allele <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was only 4.5 % and no minor homozygotes were detected .	24	17	45	None
In order to build the mutant structures , we made a point mutation in native Tyrp1 protein at <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( arginine to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) and R356Q ( arginine to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) using SPDB viewer [ ] .	22	29	18	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> decreases current amplitude which explains the LQT in the electrocardiogram , but also produces a hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage dependence of activation and tail currents , thereby explaining the additional atrial fibrillation in these patients ( Bartos et al. , ) . R5H/C produce a slowed rate of activation , a positive voltage shift of activation and/or dominant suppression of co-expressed wild type ( Franqueza et al. , ; Mohammad-Panah et al. , ; Chouabe et al. , ) . R1 , R3 , and R5 mutants all fulfill the concept of adjacent arginine replacements because there is a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> at R2 and a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at R4 ( Figure ) .	106	101	0	None
H1650 cells have also a deletion of the 3 ' part of exon 8 and the entire exon 9 of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , which causes loss of the protein [ ] and in addition express the insulin-like growth factor receptor ( IGF1R ) [ ] . The cell line H1975 has a sensitizing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> kinase domain mutation in exon 21 , but also a second mutation ( T790M , in cis , in the kinase domain ) rendering them resistant to the reversible TKIs gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	85	20	52	None
Acquired resistance , including EGFR secondary mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and other rare mutations ) , MET gene amplification , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene downregulation , high-level hepatocyte growth factor expression , epithelial–mesenchymal transition , and conversion to small cell lung cancer , – continues to restrict the durable long-term outcomes <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	48 49	19	8	None
Therefore , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> downregulation or Akt activation may be one of the mechanisms for acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . 2. Acquired resistance mechanism 1 ) Secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of the EGFR gene	17	2	26	None
In GIST and HES , respectively , the analogous <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and T674I mutation in PDGFR-alpha have been associated with acquired resistance to this drug [ , ] . To determine whether lung cancers that acquire clinical resistance to either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib display additional mutations in the EGFR kinase domain , we have examined the status of EGFR exons 18 to 24 in tumors from five patients who initially responded but subsequently progressed while on these drugs .	42	12	9	None

For example , imatinib is effective in treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with gene rearrangements that constitutively activate PDGFRB [ ] , of hypereosinophilic syndrome with activating mutations in PDGFRA [ ] , and of gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors associated with activating mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] ( all reviewed in [ ] ) . More recently , this paradigm has been extended to treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Several mutations have been identified in the context of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with NSCLC that are associated with clinical response to the small-molecule EGFR inhibitors gefitinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) or erlotinib ( Tarceva ) [ , , ] , including in-frame deletions such as del L747–E749 ; A750P in exon 19 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 .	105	44	130 131	None
For tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) [ ] , mutations within the ATP pocket of the kinase domain may affect the interaction of the drug with its target : for example , the single amino acid mutation tyrosine/methionine ( T790M ) in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR mediates secondary resistance to the EGFR TKIs erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ , ] . The T790M mutation in EGFR is structurally analogous to drug resistance mutations in other kinases such as BCR-ABL ( T315I ) , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and platelet derived growth factor receptor-α ( PDGFRα ) ( T674I ) [ ] .	59	94	96	None
Thus , in two trials , administration of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to patients with this mutation was associated with a significantly better outcome than that seen in patients with other types of K-RAS mutations. , Indeed , patients with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation appeared to benefit to approximately the same extent as patients with K-RAS wild-type tumors from the addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy .	8	38	38	None
It has even been observed that cells that have been induced to become <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by continuously exposing them to cetuximab have acquired either K-Ras <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or K-Ras <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations [ ] .	13	27	24	None
Briefly , they demonstrated the different effects of the G12 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> K-Ras alleles on response to cetuximab and found a significant association between the presence of a G13D mutation and survival benefit after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer patients [ ] . Moreover , a paper by Di Nicolantonio et al. demonstrated the different role of PI3K and K-Ras mutations in the response to the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus . In fact , while cells knocked-in for the PIK3-CA alleles H1047R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> showed an increased response to everolimus , oncogenic K-Ras mutations conferred resistance to this agents [ ] .	34	11	87	None
The D761Y mutation is located on the α-C-helix of EGFR and is similar to a mutation in BCR-ABL , D276G , that is associated with acquired resistance <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment [ ] . The L747S mutation lies at the start of the β3 strand and the α-C-helix [ ] and has analogous residues in BCR-ABL ( L237M ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or P ) that have been identified in TKI resistant disease [ ] .	27 28	59	60 61	None

The occurrence of these secondary mutations spurred development of second and third generation irreversible TKIs which bind covalently to the cysteinyl-797 residue in the pocket of the EGFR-kinase domain and overcome resistance driven by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] .	27 28	59	111	None

The uniform development of acquired resistance to lapatinib unfortunately limits its clinical efficacy .

Emodin inhibits cancer growth by suppressing tyrosine kinases and down regulating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . In the combination of erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor , typically used in non-small-cell lung cancer .

Moreover , the combination of rapamycin and the irreversible EGFR TKI , HKI-272 , resulted in the significant regression of lung tumors in transgenic mice possessing the secondary resistance mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ ] . Addition of the dual <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor PI-103 to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was necessary to induce growth arrest of human glioma cell lines with mutant PTEN [ ] , suggesting that activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by EGFR independent mechanisms confers resistance to EGFR inhibitors , but that this resistance can be overcome by the addition of pathway inhibitors .	42	38	30	None
This agent is also being assessed in a phase II trial in patients with de novo resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations not previously treated with EGFR-TKIs ( www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT01854034 ) and in patients with EGFR mutations and/or EGFR-TKI resistant disease , as part of a phase II cluster study in Chinese patients evaluating five novel inhibitors of HSP90 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , ALK , MET , and MEK ( ) . Further , AUY922 is also being assessed in combination with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients who have previously responded to EGFR-TKIs and/or whose tumors harbor activating EGFR mutations ( www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT01259089 ) , with results expected in the near future .	79	58	17	None
In addition , they showed that two dominant activating mutations in the PI3K catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) , E545K and H1047R , which are prevalent in breast cancer , also confer resistance to lapatinib [ ] . Conversely , Li et al. infected cells with lentiviruses expressing either wild-type kinases ( Src , Fyn Lyn , EGFR and others ) or kinase alleles with gatekeeper mutations . Through this approach , they showed that Src Family Kinases (SFKs) , as well as EGFR , are relevant targets for the Src inhibitor dasatinib and that acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations render cells resistant not only to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib , but also to dasatinib [ ] .	106	18	98	None
An experiment using cell lines transfected concurrently with activating mutations and a T790M mutation also proved that resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib is evident when this mutation is present [ – ] . Analogous secondary mutations of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene in case of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) [ ] and the KIT gene in case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor [ ] have previously been reported as mechanisms of imatinib resistance , which is also a TKI . The structural similarity between ABL and EGFR tyrosine kinases is considerably high , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in ABL corresponds to T790M in EGFR [ ] .	19	38	93	None
A similar clinical benefit is observed in patients with lung cancers harboring the two most common EGFR activating mutations , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and exon 19 deletions [ – , ] . The striking initial response to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors is thought to stem from the phenomenon of “oncogene addiction” [ ] , and a common signaling cascade may be involved in the apoptosis induced by multiple TKIs [ ] . Rapid inactivation of phosphorylated ERK , AKT , and STAT3/5 , and the delayed accumulation of phosphorylated p38 are commonly observed in SRC- , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and EGFR dependent cells after exposure to the specific inhibitors SU6655 , imatinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , respectively [ ] .	112	95	20	None
In EGFR , the main mutation seen after extended treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] ; the T766M resistance mutation was correctly predicted in EGFR through homology with resistance mutations seen in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , which was verified in vitro [ ] and discovered several years later in patients [ - ] .	11	35	14	None
As it was shown previously , the sensitivity of Co(III)- and Pt ( II ) TPP towards aliphatic alcohols decreases in a following order [ ] : ethanol & gt ; methanol & gt ; isobutyl alcohol ; while in [ and ] the response of 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl porphyrin ( H2TPP ) and its Co(II) complexes based sensors , towards the changes in acetic acid , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , ammonia , NaCl , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , quinine , glucose , monosodium glutamate , dissolved SO2 , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> content was evolved .	65	71	84	None
Cover glasses pretreated with acetone , absolute <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and 0.1 M <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in turn were coated and used for immunofluorescence assay . Every three days , half of the mediums were replaced by fresh ones . For nucleoside analogues toxicity experiment , 25 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , 50 µM AZT , 25 µM 3TC , or 25 µM DDI were tested to be the appropriated mtDNA toxicity concentrations which did not inhibit neuron growth by PI and Calcein-AM uptake test and were kept in the cultural medium for seven days respectively .	7	11	43 44	None
Previous studies showed that Ile , Met , and several non-standard amino acids could be misactivated by LeuRS in vitro , and further charged to tRNALeu by editing defective mutants such as E. coli LeuRS ( EcLeuRS ) <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , yielding mischarged tRNALeu . Therefore , SptRNALeu was methionylated at 37°C in a 300-μL volume containing 100 mM <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( pH 7.8 ) , 30 mM KCl , 12 mM MgCl2 , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 4 mM ATP , 40 μM [ 3H ] Met , 20 μM purified SptRNALeu , and 0.5 μM EcLeuRS-D345A mutant for 30 min . The mixtures were isolated by acid phenol/chloroform extraction ( pH 4.5 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> precipitation followed by resuspension in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 5.2 ) .	117	58	38	None
This trial provided valuable evidence of ponatinib’s direct kinase inhibiting activity in patients with a variety of BCR-ABL mutations , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , leading to further evaluation of its effects . Preclinical <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has been observed to achieve marked reductions in levels of phosphorylated BCR-ABL and CrkL within 6 hours of administration in a mouse model injected with T315I-variant BCR-ABL expressing <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells .	34	63	21 22	None
The in vivo antineoplastic activity of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as a single agent against imatinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα expressing cells was evaluated in the nude mouse xenograft model . Thirty nu/nu BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> PDGFRα cells .	6	34	13	None
The BCR-ABL positive cell line Ba/F3 BCR-ABL with wild-type and mutant Ba/F3 cells ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) was previously established . These cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum containing 1 % penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37°C . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells were established previously .	47	48	14	None
Emission ratio ( emission signal at 510 nm divided by emission signal at 486 nm ) was plotted against concentration of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . ( B ) The same experiment as ( A ) was performed in parallel with 90 pM of SNAP-eDHFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and 2.2 nM of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	21	47	42	None
To evaluate the performance of the method , we analyzed the binding of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> to Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase ( eDHFR ) . The binding between MTX and eDHFR is well characterized and a series of eDHFR mutants are available , which bind to MTX with wide range of affinity , . We prepared SNAP tagged constructs of eDHFR wild-type ( WT ) and three eDHFR mutants ( eDHFR L54I , eDHFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and eDHFR F31V , L54G ) for which the reported Kd values to free MTX range from low pM to low µM , .	13	13 14	73	None
On the other hand , others have suggested a dynamic hypothesis in which the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution interrupts a “network of coupled promoting vibrations” that are required for DHFR catalysis , . Indeed , our work showed that the active site of DHFR is dynamically coupled to G121 . When <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> is added to the DHFR holoenzyme forming the ternary E : NADPH : MTX complex , G121 becomes more flexible on the ps-ns timescale and chemical exchange on the µs-ms timescale is quenched .	49	49 50	14	None

HGF induces resistance to irreversible EGFR-TKIs and mutant EGFR-selective TKIs , which were developed to overcome <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated EGFR-TKI resistance . Recent clinical trials with irreversible TKI monotherapy failed to demonstrate an objective response in EGFR mutant lung cancer patients that were refractory to treatment with the reversible EGFR-TKIs—gefitinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . These findings suggest that co-existence of altered <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signaling contributes to the unfavorable response to irreversible EGFR-TKIs in these patients .	49 50	59	16	None
Most NSCLC patients who harbor activating EGFR mutations , including deletions in exon 19 or the point mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 , experience an initial marked response to the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . However , almost all such individuals eventually develop acquired resistance to these drugs within 1 year . In addition , 20 % –30 % of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations do not show an initial response to EGFR-TKIs. , , Therapeutic strategies to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations have been developed on the basis of the biological mechanisms of such resistance , which include a T790M secondary mutation in EGFR as well as amplification of the gene for the receptor tyrosine kinase MET , which serves as the receptor for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	33	129 130 131	18	None
Some of the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance include T790M second mutation , mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ( MET ) amplification , ATP binding cassette (ABC)-G2 transporter ( ABCG2 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> overexpression , insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein-3 ( IGFBP3 ) downregulation , as well as ERBB3 activation . T790M mutation The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> second mutation accounts for half of all resistances to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	69	31 32 33 34	57	None
The second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors , dasatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , can circumvent most mutations that confer resistance to imatinib ; the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , however , causes resistance to all <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase inhibitors developed so far .	7	29	20	None
Preclinical activity of bosutinib has been reported against most IM-resistant mutants of BCR-ABL with the exception of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and V299L. , In clinical studies , the impact of preexisting <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations on bosutinib efficacy was evaluated in patients pretreated with IM only ( n = 115 ) or with IM followed by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and/or dasatinib ( n = 39 ) .	52	29	17	None
Our results show that bortezomib and paclitaxel combined treatment is able to target the TKIs-resistant cell lines with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in Bcr-Abl . Bortezomib in combination with the PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536 induces a significant downregulation of the total levels and phosphorylation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , a decrease of downstream phosphorylated STAT5 and caspase dependent cell death in imatinib- , dasatinib- and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and -sensitive K562 cell lines	62	44	19	None
In our retrospective study , 26.7 % of patients , all with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> wild-type tumours , who had previously unresectable liver-only metastases , underwent surgical resection after systemic therapy , with R0 resection achieved in 38 patients ( 21.6 % ) ; one of those was patient with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Although it is difficult to make any comparison , because our patients were not selected according to specific systemic therapy , these results are comparable with those reported in previous studies claiming that 19 to 23 % patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and irinotecan based chemotherapy and with previously unresectable liver-only metastases underwent resection.– In a recently published clinical study BOXER , where the patients with unresectable liver-only metastases were treated with oxaliplatin , capecitabine and bevacizumab , R0 resection was achieved in 40 % of patients .	93	12	50	None

Similarly , our case demonstrated BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , wild-type KRAS and no evidence of microsatellite instability on immunohistochemical workup . However , we did not assess our case for CpG island methylation status . From the therapeutic standpoint , wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> status would imply tumor responsiveness to novel biological molecules such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) compounds ; however , a BRAF mutation and rhabdoid morphology would signify the opposite : a poor response to conventional and novel chemotherapy regimens and a likely refractory disease with relapses .	53	41	6	None
In this study , SW480 and HCT116 cells were more resistant to apoptosis when treated with regimens containing cetuximab than when treated with regimens containing <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . This finding is related to the fact that both cell lines harbor a KRAS mutation , with SW480 and HCT116 cells expressing G12V and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants , respectively .	25	52	51	None
Similarly , tumour response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> may be influenced by polymorphisms in genes involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway ( ; ) . These include polymorphisms in codon 118 ( AAC to AAT ) of the excision repair cross complementing group 1 ( ERCC1 ) gene and codon 399 ( CGG to CAG ) of the X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 ( XRCC1 ) . The aim of this study was to evaluate three genetic alterations ( TP53 mutation , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation and MSI ) and three polymorphisms ( MTHFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , ERCC1-118 and XRCC1-399 ) for their ability to predict response and toxicity to FOLFOX first line chemotherapy in the treatment of mCRC .	5	82	92	None
The activating <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutation is present in an additional 10 % of patients , and it may be predictive of a lack of response to anti-EGFR therapy [ ] in addition to a clear poor prognostic factor . The anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies and their predictive biomarkers have taken CRC treatment another step closer to personalized therapy . However , the recent results of the large UK COIN study and a Belgian study have not confirmed a benefit in terms of PFS or OS from the addition of cetuximab to oxaliplatin based chemotherapy in wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> patients versus 5-FU and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> alone [ , ] .	100	95	2	None
For example , BRCA1 can inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_drug> receptor (PR) activity in the PR-positive human breast cancer cell line <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ , ] and repress <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activity in MCF-7 cells [ ] .	6	24 25	18	None
As for the status of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , these two E2-selected cell lines show some different characteristics ( Figure ) . E2-selected MCF-7 line ( P35E ) was found to show a drastically low mRNA level of ERα , but E2-selected MCF10AT1 line ( i.e. P20E ) did not show such a decrease in the mRNA expression of ERα as compared to the matched `` mock '' -selected control cell line ( designated <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( not shown ) . However , P20E MCF10AT1 cells showed no detectable level of expression of either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> receptor (PR) as in the case of P35E ( shown in Figure ) or PS2 ( not shown ) .	96	6 7 8	75 76	None
A polymorphic variant in the EGFR gene arising from a single nucleotide substitution ( 142285G&gt;A ) leading to an Arginine ( R ) /Lysine ( K ) substitution in codon 521 in the extracellular subdomain IV of the EGFR gene ( rs11543848 , also known as HER-1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) has been identified [ ] . Compared with the “wild-type” HER-1 142285G ( 521R ) allele , that the 142285A ( 521K ) variant has attenuated function in ligand binding , growth stimulation , tyrosine kinase activation , and induction of the proto-oncogenes myc , fos , and jun [ ] . Among the steroid receptors , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> alpha ( ERα or ESR1 , MIM : 133430 ) and the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> receptor ( PGR , MIM : 607311 ) are of special interest because of their elevated protein levels in some premalignant and malignant breast cells [ ] .	120 121	106 107	47	None
See de la Lastra and Villegas [ ] for a review of the reported <ANNO_TYPE_drug> effects . Stilbenes are synthesized via the phenylpropanoid/malonate pathway from phenylalanine that , in turn , is converted into cinnamic acid by phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL ) . The consecutive action of cinnamate 4-hydroxylase ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and 4-coumarate <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ligase ( 4CL ) transform cinnamic acid into p-coumaryl-CoA .	14	55	51	None
The obtained cinnamic acid is activated by ligation to coenzyme A by 4-coumaroyl : CoA ligase ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is then synthesized by the stilbene synthase (STS) which acts to condense three successive units of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with p-coumaroyl-CoA .	20	37	17	None
Finally , Shin and coworkers engineered the S. cerevisiae strain ( W303-1A ) with four heterologous genes , the PAL gene from Rhodosporidium toruloides , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and the 4CL1 genes from A. thaliana , and the STS gene from Arachis hypogea [ ] . Overexpression of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> carboxylase ( ACC1 ) gene for increasing the pool of malonyl-CoA resulted in an engineered strain termed W303-1A/ACC1 harboring the p425PAL , p423C4H , and pESCTRP4CL1-STS plasmids capable of synthesizing 5.8 mg/L <ANNO_TYPE_drug> upon feeding with 12 mM tyrosine in YP medium containing 2 % galactose .	81	48	26	None
A. <ANNO_TYPE_drug> antiproliferative EC50 in the presence of 0.4 to 10 μM GNF‐5 on Ba/F3 cells <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and E505K Bcr‐Abl. B. Inhibition of Bcr‐Abl autophosphoryl‐ation was determined by Bcr‐Abl immunoprecipitation , followed by a immunoblot for phospho‐Tyr ( Tyr412 ) , phospho‐STAT 5 ( Tyr694 ) and total Bcr‐Abl ( antibody K‐12 ) from cell lystates obtained after treatment of T315I Bcr‐Abl expressing <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with 10 μM of dasatinib and increasing concentrations of GNF‐5 ( 0 , 0.5 , 5 and 10 μM ) for 90 min.

In addition , the IC50 values for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were 0.5 to 30nM in parental cells and 30 to more than 300nM in resistant cells . As a whole our findings confirmed the efficacy of ponatinib on the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , but also highlighted the notion that ponatinib is effective on all types of imatinib-resistant CML cells , whatever their mode of resistance . Importantly , the IC50 values obtained for ponatinib in the present study for BaF3-WT-BCR-ABL , BaF3-T315I-BCR-ABL and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( 1nM , 8nM and 8nM respectively ) were very similar to the one reported previously by O’ Hare et al. ( 0.5 , 11 and 4.1nM respectively ) [ ] .	7	80	37	None
Murine Baf3 Bcr-Abl and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Bcr-Abl <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells were plated in 75cm2 flasks ( 4 x 106 cells/35 ml/flask ) and treated with 0.5 or 1 µM imatinib . For nilotinib and dasatinib treatments , the cells were plated in 25cm2 flasks ( 2 x 106 cells/10 ml/flask ) and treated with 0.125 µM or 0.5 µM nilotinib and 0.056 µM or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for 48h .	62 63 64	4	6	None
On the contrary , the mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 2 has been associated with better response to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> antibodies than other KRAS mutations , but the data are mixed. , In addition to the exon 2 KRAS mutation , other mutations such as KRAS mutation exons 3–4 and NRAS mutation exons 2–4 have also emerged to be clinically relevant biomarkers of a lack of response to EGFR antibodies . For example , treating RAS-mutant tumor patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> may even have a detrimental effect on survival as shown in the Panitumumab Randomized Trial in Combination With Chemotherapy for Metastatic CRC to Determine Efficacy ( PRIME ) study , where patients were randomized to first-line chemotherapy with or without panitumumab .	77	17	6	None
Furthermore , although KRAS mutations are typically associated with non-responsiveness to anti-EGFR antibodies , recent data indicate that KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations may be a positive predictor of cetuximab response . Mutations within the PIK3CA gene , which is an important regulator of PI3K signaling , are also present in some CRC tumors that can co-occur with KRAS or BRAF mutations , , thus suggesting their possible influence on responsiveness to targeted therapeutics such as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> antibodies but a clear demonstration of such a correlation is lacking , . From the studies outlined above and given that a large proportion of CRC patients with KRAS WT tumors do not respond to cetuximab or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , it is clear that a simple mutational analysis is insufficient to predict responsiveness to such therapeutics .	112	74	19	None
The cause of refractoriness has been identified in ca. 15 % of mCRC patients as mutations in the BRAF gene , primarily <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution . Raf family proteins are downstream of Ras proteins in the signal transduction pathway originating at <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . It comes as no surprise , then , that activating mutations in the BRAF gene occurring in cancer cells have a similar clinical effect to KRAS gene mutations , making them refractory both to cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , , – ] .	78	40	22	None
Two cases of c-KIT mutated thymic cancers responsive to sorafenib have been reported : in one case , a patient with the missense mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 17 had a partial response lasting more than 15 months , while in the other case , stable disease was achieved in the presence of exon 11 deletion. , Besides inhibiting <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and sorafenib also inhibit VEGFR and PDGFR , which are involved in angiogenesis and might play important roles in the pathogenesis of thymic cancers .	60	58	24	None
Consistent with this , Ströbel et al reported disease response in all four cases of wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> thymic cancer treated <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . In this paper , we have described the case of a patient affected by thymic carcinoma harboring the missense mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 13 of the c-KIT gene who was treated with both sorafenib and imatinib .	20 21	16	43	None
The second-line treatment , after imatinib failure , is provided by less specific kinase inhibitors , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> that shows potency against imatinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutated in the ATP binding pocket ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T670I ) .	18	24	32	None
In addition to the phase II imatinib trial , a case report describes 70 % tumor shrinkage after treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in a patient with metastatic mucosal melanoma bearing a mutation in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> exon 11 . In a recent report , the c-KIT mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was associated with resistance to multiple KIT inhibitors including imatinib , nilotinib , and sorafenib , but objective tumor responses could be induced in 2 patients bearing the KIT L576P mutation after treatment with dasatinib .	20	32	44	None
Wild-type patients do not seem to benefit from adjuvant imatinib [ ] ; however , in vivo studies evaluating <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] and in vitro studies for nilotinib and dasatinib [ ] are promising . As for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutated GIST , PDGFRA exon 18 generally benefits from adjuvant imatinib therapy , with the exception of PDGFRA exon 18 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated GIST [ ] .	19	37	58	None

The 2 patients with mutations in PDGFRA had them in exon 18 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or exon 12 . The small series does not permit any conclusive considerations on the correlation of DMD involvement with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase genotype . But as the clinical use of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and regorafenib after imatinib failure does not completely cover the molecular landscape of the progressing GIST , a novel approach that targets dystrophin deregulation may have relevance in GIST treatment .	43	33	12	None
As shown in Figure , BaF3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL were highly sensitive to imatinib , dasatinib and ponatinib , whereas <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and BaF3-G250E-BCR-ABL cells were resistant to both imatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . By contrast , ponatinib induced loss of cell viability in BaF3 cells carrying the T315I or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , in agreement with previous results from the literature [ , ] .	31	21	49	None

For nilotinib and dasatinib treatments , the cells were plated in 25cm2 flasks ( 2 x 106 cells/10 ml/flask ) and treated with 0.125 µM or 0.5 µM nilotinib and 0.056 µM or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for 48h .	62 63 64	4	6	None
Moreover , as shown in , SHP2 physically associated with PECAM-1 more prominently in cells expressing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or T315I mutant as compared with cells expressing native BCR/ABL , while these mutants had less significant effects on complex formation between SHP2 and Gab2 . We next examined the effect of dasatinib on tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells expressing the T315I mutant , which is totally resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as well as imatinib but sensitive to the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib ( , ) .	69	57	17	None
The two mutations were shown to independently induce <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells engineered to express the L1196M and C1156Y mutations . By mid-2012 , additional patient studies led to the discovery of several other secondary mutations , . That is , three other mutations in the a-Chelix were discovered : a threonine insertion at amino acid 1151 ( 1151Tins ) , a leucine to arginine ( L1152R ) and phenylalanine to leucine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	8	11	74	None
In vivo efficacy was described only for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutation , confirming a higher potency with respect to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in inhibiting the in vivo growth of ALK–L1196M driven <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells .	19	29	8	None
In fact , the patient with EGFR c.2573T & gt ; G ( L858R ) and EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ; T ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) was treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and a short-term improvement was observed .	26	17	21	None
Further studies of gefitinib revealed that this 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor , structurally similar to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , binds the EGFR c.2573T & gt ; G ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) mutant with a 20-fold higher affinity compared to the wild-type enzyme . Both mutations , the activating EGFR c.2573T & gt ; G ( L858R ) and the inhibiting EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ; T ( T790M ) were found in our cytological assessment .	13	56	24	None
That point mutation is caused by a single nucleotide substitution ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ; T ) at position 2369 ( codon 790 ) in exon 20 of the EGFR gene . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation leads to a substitution of threonine to methionine in the catalytic centre of EGFR tyrosine kinase , which is located in the binding pocket of TKI and ATP . Substitution of threonine at codon 790 into larger methionine probably results in blocking of the binding sites of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib aromatic residues with their point of action .	81	11 12	32	None
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was detected only twice in CTCs captured from nine blood samples : one week after bone marrow biopsy , with 10/20 EpCAM captured cells having the mutation , and six weeks after bone marrow biopsy , with 2/7 EpCAM captured cells having the mutation . Drug treatments are noted ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> = <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , an mTOR inhibitor ) .	55	53	1	None
Another study demonstrated that Akt is activated in AML blasts and that p70 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and 4EBP-1 , downstream mediators of Akt signaling , also are phosphorylated in AML blasts [ ] . In a short-term culture system , most AML patient samples showed a dose dependent decrease in survival after incubation with LY294002 [ ] . Incubation of AML blasts with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> induced only a small decrease in survival of the cells [ ] .	63	63	14	None
Mutation at the analogous position to Thr315 in other <ANNO_TYPE_drug> targets such as c-KIT ( Thr670 ) and PDGFRA ( Thr674 ) have been linked to imatinib resistance in patients with GIST and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , respectively , . Similarly , the gatekeeper mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR causes resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib , and has been detected in lung cancer patients before drug treatment and in the germ line of a family pedigree with several cases of lung cancer , .	9	33	43	None
Targeted therapy to inhibit the oncogene FIP1L1-PDGFRα has met with some success : the first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has been reported to be effective to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , but imatinib-resistant mutations emerged . Several mutations in the kinase domains such as D842V , T674I , S601P and L629P , have been demonstrated to be responsible for the drug-resistance . Of note , the “gate-keeper” mutant T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα in HES , similar <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> Bcr-Abl in CML , was also refractory to some second-generation TKIs , such as nilotinib , sorafenib .	20 21	29	74 75	None
( B ) The percentages of dead cells ( PI+ , black ) and vital cells characterized by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ( PI− , ΔΨm low , white ) were determined following treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) or indicated concentrations of sagopilone for 72 h. Mean percentages and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> given ( n = 2 ) . In order to analyze the colony forming potential of cells remaining vital in the presence of sagopilone , clonogenic assays were performed ( Figure A ) . A 2-h incubation with 100 nM sagopilone completely inhibited colony forming in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , SKBR3 , and A549 cancer cells , but only partially in MCF7 cancer cells .	36 37 38	51	98	None
The sensitivity of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> can be classified as sensitive ( IC50 ≤ 5 nM ) , intermediately sensitive ( IC50 = 5 to 11 nM ; ie , E255K/V <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and insensitive ( IC50 & gt ; 11 nM ; ie , T315I ) ( Table ) .	6	3	32 33	None
In various biological assays , P-loop mutants <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and E255K exhibited an increased transformation potency relative to unmutated BCR-ABL. Overall , the relative transformation potencies of various mutations were found to be as follows : Y253F & gt ; E255K & gt ; native BCR-ABL ≥ T315I & gt ; H396P &gt ; M351T . Transformation potency also correlated with intrinsic <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase activity in this study . Two agents are currently approved for second-line treatment of patients with CML who demonstrate resistance ( or intolerance ) to imatinib : <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and nilotinib [ , ] .	90	61	7	None
Y253H , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and F359V were deemed less sensitive , but not inherently resistant , as was the T315I identified in three patients receiving nilotinib . Six of 16 imatinib treated patients ( 38 % ) with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations progressed to accelerated phase/blast crisis CML , as compared with 1/13 ( 8 % ) of nilotinib treated patients . Investigators at MD Anderson Cancer Center also recently presented their institutional history with nilotinib ( n = 90 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( n = 82 ) used in frontline CML therapy or for accelerated phase CML patients who had not been previously treated .	80	38	2	None
Our findings are in accordance with a prior report by Carlson and colleagues , who demonstrated that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> causes cell cytotoxicity by G1-S phase arrest in MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells [ ] . RB protein , a tumor suppressor that blocks <ANNO_TYPE_variant> transcription factor , regulates transcription of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> genes involved in cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase .	17	48	41	None

While initial studies of first-generation CDK inhibitors , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , failed to demonstrate efficacy in preclinical studies , second-generation CDK inhibitors ( SCH 727965 ) , have shown more promising results in halting melanoma progression in mouse xenografts . This effect is potentiated when CDK inhibitors are combined with paclitaxel. , RB1 is the central piece of the pathway controlled by p16INK4A , serving in its unphosphorylated form to sequester <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , preventing it from inducing gene expression critical for transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle .	10	72 73 74	72	None
Searching for a mechanism for LMO4 function , Visvader and colleagues identified both the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> carboxy-terminal binding protein ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , a protein targeted by adenoviral <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 as binding partners for LMO4 and demonstrated repression by LMO4 of BRCA1 mediated transactivation in mammalian cells .	14	19	26	None
It would be interesting to study in the future if <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , MECP2 , LSD1 or other yet-to-be identified REST interactors are involved . Notably , we did not observe pathways specifically enriched in any group of REST targets with different <ANNO_TYPE_drug> occupancies .	43	12	10	None
To our knowledge , no NSCLC patient who initially responded to but then progressed on either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib has yet been treated with lapatinib . In some of the patient specimens analyzed , the actual sequencing peaks demonstrating the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation were smaller than originally anticipated . These results differ from those of acquired resistance mutation in CML [ ] , GIST [ , ] , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] .	16	68	40	None
For example , in CML , a commonly found mutation is a C→T single nucleotide change that replaces threonine with isoleucine at position 315 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in the ABL kinase domain [ , , ] . In GIST and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , respectively , the analogous T670I mutation in KIT and T674I mutation in PDGFR-alpha have been associated with acquired resistance to this drug [ , ] . To determine whether lung cancers that acquire clinical resistance to either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib display additional mutations in the EGFR kinase domain , we have examined the status of EGFR exons 18 to 24 in tumors from five patients who initially responded but subsequently progressed while on these drugs .	79	40	24 25	None
Mutation at the analogous position to Thr315 in other imatinib targets such as c-KIT ( Thr670 ) and PDGFRA ( Thr674 ) have been linked to imatinib resistance in patients with GIST and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , respectively , . Similarly , the gatekeeper mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR causes resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , and has been detected in lung cancer patients before drug treatment and in the germ line of a family pedigree with several cases of lung cancer , .	49	33	43	None
This is in keeping with an earlier study by Di Nicolantonio and colleagues [ ] , where the response to panitumumab or cetuximab was found to be impeded by the presence of BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and restored ( in a cellular model of CRC cells ) by BRAF inhibitor sorafenib [ ] . They suggested that this experimental observation should encourage conceiving clinical trials using multiple therapies with EGFR and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors , considering that cetuximab , panitumumab , and sorafenib are already approved for clinical use . Standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy , using <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or oxaliplatin did not seem to be affected by KRAS/BRAF mutations [ ] .	93	70	33	None
Although a retrospective study and the PICCOLO ( Panitumumab , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and Ciclosporin in Colorectal Cancer Therapy ) trial have demonstrated a reduced response to cetuximab and panitumumab for patients with NRAS mutations , , further work is required to demonstrate the predictive capacity of these mutations . The serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf is an effector in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signaling pathway , downstream of K-Ras . Mutations in the proto-oncogene BRAF are present in 5 % –10 % of the metastatic CRC population and are also mutually exclusive of KRAS mutations . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is the most common of all BRAF mutations ( present in 90 % of cases ) , and is enriched in a subset of patients who are female , greater than 70 years of age , with KRAS WT right sided colon cancer .	10	57	91 92	None
10.1371/journal.pone.0050701.g001Knocking down KRAS expression in KRAS-mutant ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) CRC cells confers oxaliplatin resistance and ERCC1 upregulation . ( A ) <ANNO_TYPE_gene> DLD-1G13D cells were more resistant to oxaliplatin , but have the same sensitivity to irinotecan , 5FU , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than parental DLD-1G13D cells , as demonstrated by MTT assay .	41	21	7	None
10.1371/journal.pone.0050701.g002Knocking down KRAS expression in other KRAS-mutant subtype ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) CRC cells results in oxaliplatin resistance and ERCC1 upregulation . ( A ) <ANNO_TYPE_gene> SW480G12V cells were more resistant to oxaliplatin , but have the same sensitivity to irinotecan , 5FU , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than parental SW480G12V cells , as demonstrated by MTT assay .	44	24	9	None
Similarly , the analysis of oncogenic signaling pathway showed that older patients have a lower probability of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and PI3-kinase pathway activation , but a higher probability of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , TNF , Src , and EPI pathway activation . Using genomic derived signatures of anthracycline-sensitivity , elderly patients presented a uniformly anthracycline resistant signature irrespective of tumor biology , while younger patients were much more likely to be sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	70	28	17	None
EGFR–TKIs such <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib attain a response rate of approximately 70 % and progression-free survival of 9–13 months , although subgroups of patients experience long lasting remission. , Use of EGFR–TKIs as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations improved progression-free survival with acceptable toxicity , compared with standard chemotherapy . EGFR–TKIs are currently considered a standard first-line treatment for this disease entity.– However , these tumors eventually develop resistance to EGFR–TKIs , possibly as a result of a secondary threonine–methionine substitution mutation at position 790 in exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , MET amplification , or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> overexpression in relapsed tumors .	2 3	103 104 105	94 95 96	None
While the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation represents a direct mechanism for drug resistance that occurs at the level of drug accessibility to the target , there are a number of indirect mechanisms that involve the increased expression or activation of alternative growth factor receptors to maintain signal flux , despite EGFR inhibition . Perhaps the best characterized of these is the amplification of the Met receptor and/or elevated levels of its ligand <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . In <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant NSCLC cell lines , Met drives ErbB3 dependent activation of the PI3K pathway .	73	70	2	None
Cyclin D1 , in association with cyclin dependent kinase-4 and -6 , induces the cell to enter the S phase by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressing protein , which binds to transcription factors , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . In addition to the overexpression of cyclin D1 , other genes that overexpress in MCL , such as VEGF and Raf-1 , represent further possible targets for mTOR inhibitors . Indeed , a constitutive activation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and mTOR pathways either in MCL cell lines ( Granta 519 , Jeko-1 , and SP-53 ) or in primary cultures from 30 % of MCL patients has been reported. , Moreover , mTOR inhibitors in MCL could synergize with other “canonical” agents , such as vincristine , doxorubicin <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and rituximab , with resulting inhibition of Raf-1 , MAPK , and mTOR . ,	123 124	73	35	None
Using a cell viability assay , BEZ235 has also demonstrated an additive effect when combined with dexamethasone , doxorubicin , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . In a recent preclinical study , BEZ235 has been shown to be effective against follicular lymphoma cell lines . BEZ235 successfully inhibited <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , mTOR , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> phosphorylation in K422 , SUDHL16 , FL-18 , and SUDHL4 cell lines .	21	45	50	None
Another critical serine-threonine protein kinase involved in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway that has been targeted to block its constitutive kinase activation is BRAF . , BRAF mutation ( V600E ) is reported in 24 % of papillary derived ATC . Preclinical and clinical studies investigating combination therapy with agents such as selective ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) and potent ( BAY 73-4506 and ARQ 736 ) small-molecule BRAF inhibitors , and MAP/ERK kinase inhibitors ( AZD6244 ) hold great promise in the treatment of BRAF ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ATC . , ,	52	8	83	None
In fact , there was a markedly increased pErk signal in one NRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated cell line ( M207 ) , an observation consistent with data from others that has been attributed to loss of negative regulatory pathways [ , ] and enhanced signaling through C-Raf [ , ] . Therefore , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway signaling specifically in cell lines that harbor the BRAFV600E mutation .	52	54	13	None
For the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell line , medium was supplemented with 0,6 μg/ml <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . 9-cis-RA and BMS493 were dissolved in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and used at 1 × 10-6 M unless otherwise indicated .	20	12	2	None
A total of 864 Caucasian men ( n = 413 ) and women ( n = 451 ) have been consecutively recruited in the context of a study on <ANNO_TYPE_gene> resistance at the Department of Medicine , University of Leipzig , to represent a wide range of obesity , insulin sensitivity , and glucose tolerance . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was defined by 120-min glucose ≥11.1 mmol/l . All individuals fulfilled the following exclusion criteria : 1 ) Any acute or chronic inflammatory disease as determined by a leucocyte count & gt ; 7000 Gpt/l , CRP & gt ; 5.0 mg/dl , or clinical signs of infection ; 2 ) antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) ; 3 ) history of hypertension or systolic blood pressure (SBP) & gt ; 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) & gt ; 85 mmHg ; 4 ) clinical evidence of either cardiovascular or peripheral artery disease ; 5 ) thyroid dysfunction ; 6 ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or drug abuse ; 7 ) pregnancy .	160	29	56	None
Mutation at the analogous position to Thr315 in other <ANNO_TYPE_drug> targets such as c-KIT ( Thr670 ) and PDGFRA ( Thr674 ) have been linked to imatinib resistance in patients with GIST and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , respectively , . Similarly , the gatekeeper mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR causes resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib , and has been detected in lung cancer patients before drug treatment and in the germ line of a family pedigree with several cases of lung cancer , .	9	33	43	None
Using this insight , new small-molecule inhibitors have been identified that retain activity against the majority of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> BCR-ABL mutants [ , ] . For example , in CML , a commonly found mutation is a C→T single nucleotide change that replaces threonine with isoleucine at position 315 ( T315I ) in the ABL kinase domain [ , , ] . In GIST and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , respectively , the analogous T670I mutation in KIT and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in PDGFR-alpha have been associated with acquired resistance to this drug [ , ] .	17	64	75	None
Primary results from the EMILIA study , a randomized trial comparing <ANNO_TYPE_drug> DM-1 to lapatinib and capecitabine , have shown that Trastuzumab DM-1 significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer . Further research is looking into inhibiting other targets such as mTOR , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathways .	11	51	48	None
Further research is looking into inhibiting other targets such as mTOR , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathways .

Reconstitution studies with PTEN gene therapy in a mouse model for lung cancer , for example , reveals that apoptosis is increased , while <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and mTOR activation is decreased significantly ( ) . In addition , antisense oligonucleotides to PTEN resulted in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance , while rescue of PTEN through <ANNO_TYPE_variant> inhibitors restored trastuzumab sensitivity ( ) .	43	24	51	None
A recent study indicated that mutation of SOD1 gene has genetic linkage in ALS disease , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> associated SOD 1 mutations including alanine 4 by valine ( A4V ) [ – ] <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> 46 by arginine <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) [ – ] , and I113T mutation [ – ] .	32 33	16	37 38	None
Dasatinib is active against at least 100 of the BCR-ABL1 mutations known to confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> that have been tested to date , ( including many in the p-loop region ) , except for the T315I mutation and a few other mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , F317L/V , and T315A ) . Dasatinib is able to block downstream intracellular signaling pathways activated by BCR-ABL1 in vitro , including signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ( Stat5 ) , with downregulation of Stat5 target gene expression and the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway. , Notably , dasatinib is not a substrate of multidrug resistance protein-1 , an efflux protein expressed on normal and leukemic hematopoietic stem cells .	16	88 89 90 91	44	None
In fact , the pleiotropic effect of BCR/ABL transformation is mostly dependent on post-translational modifications ( e.g. phosphorylation ) of signalling molecules , like those involved in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , PI3K/Akt and STATs pathways , which control cell growth , survival and differentiation of haematopoietic cells by modulating the expression and/or activity of downstream effectors ( ; ) ( ) . Being the deregulated BCR/ABL kinase activity the cause of CML , targeting its catalytic domain was the most rationale approach for the rational development of small molecules that inhibit ABL kinase activity . In these CML-BC patients , imatinib resistance often depends on reactivation of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase activity via mechanisms involving BCR/ABL overexpression , gene amplification or mutations that suppress imatinib mediated kinase inhibition ( i.e. E255V and G250E ) or disrupt <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding ( i.e. <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( ) .	134	28	138	None
However , the secondary mutation T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα in its kinase domain has been found in imatinib-refractory <ANNO_TYPE_gene> or CEL .

<ANNO_TYPE_variant> is located in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> domain [ ] , which may play a role in protein folding [ ] . Although the substitution of arginine with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> would not dramatically affect the protein polarity , the newly added guanidine group may affect the protein stability by modifying the folding structure of LRRK2 .	27	5	0	None
There are two missense mutations identified so far in the AR segment of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> that are related to HS : H277R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( , ) . Importantly , the His → Arg substitution involves a highly <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> of the TPLH motif .	37 38	13	22	None
In addition to BCR-ABL , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibits other oncogenic kinases including the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> family kinases , c-Kit , and platelet derived growth factor receptors ( PDGFR ) . Nilotinib inhibits kinase targets including BCR-ABL , PDGFR , and c-Kit , but not the Src family kinases . While the first and second-generation TKIs have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients with CML and Ph+ ALL , resistance still occurs in a subset of patients who harbor BCR-ABL mutations , particularly the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	5	12	80	None
In addition , they showed that two dominant activating mutations in the PI3K catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PI3K-CA ) , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and H1047R , which are prevalent in breast cancer , also confer resistance to lapatinib [ ] . Conversely , Li et al. infected cells with lentiviruses expressing either wild-type kinases ( Src , Fyn Lyn , EGFR and others ) or kinase alleles with gatekeeper mutations . Through this approach , they showed that Src Family Kinases (SFKs) , as well as EGFR , are relevant targets for the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and that acquired T790M mutations render cells resistant not only to erlotinib and gefitinib , but also to dasatinib [ ] .	94	92	21	None
<ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations ( V600E ) were present in 12 % of the tumors . The mutational frequencies of the 195 KRAS mutations in the NORDIC VII cohort were ; G12A ( 9.7 % ) , G12R ( 1.5 % ) , G12D ( 35.4 % ) , G12C ( 9.7 % ) , G12S ( 6.2 % ) , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( 15.4 % ) , and G13D ( 22.1 % ) . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> did not add significant benefit to Nordic FLOX and KRAS mutation was not predictive for cetuximab effect .	72	0	59	None
Also available is a second assay , the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( V600E Sequencing ) ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , which uses sequencing to detect the BRAF p.Val600Glu sequence variant . Public Health Importance Available evidence indicates that the clinical benefit from treatment with EGFR monoclonal antibody inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab is limited to a subgroup of only 10 % to 30 % of CRC patients .	45	8	14	None
Besides , after EGF treatment , cDzT remained its suppression effect on EGFR protein expression and downstream signaling including EGFR , STAT3 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and ERK ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Synergistic antitumor effect of combined treatment with cDzT and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in vitro and in vivo cDzT could be used as single agent or as part of combination therapy with second generation TKIs to increase efficacy in the treatment of NSCLCs that harbor the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant .	42	23	77	None

Bufalin Overcomes the Resistance to Irreversible EGFR-TKIs Induced by HGF via Inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Pathway H1975 cancer cell line with mutations in EGFR exons 21 ( L858R ) and 20 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) was refractory to reversible EGFR-TKIs , gefitinib , and erlotinib [ ] , but was sensitive to irreversible EGFR-TKIs , such as BIBW2992 ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) .	58	14	32	None
As a result , HSC are attracted to the circulation through a positive signal , most likely the sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . Alternatively HSC passively move to the blood . ( b ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> targets <ANNO_TYPE_gene> that is produced by BM stromal cells , causing a decrease of its levels and leading ultimately to mobilization .	33	35	20	None
Our data also support a recent previous report in which mice exposed both to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor agonist and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> showed increased mobilization of HSPCs compared with mice exposed to AMD3100 alone [ ] . Based on our data , we conclude that hemolysis , even if it significantly elevates the S1P level in PB , requires attenuation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> axis mediated retention of HSPCs in BM niches in order to affect mobilization of HSPCs .	18	59	14	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> or leiomyoma cells treated with RU486 for 1 hour were fixed with 1 % formaldehyde for 15 min and quenched with 0.125 M glycine . Chromatin was isolated by adding lysis buffer , followed by disruption with a Dounce homogenizer . Lysates were sonicated and the DNA sheared to an average length of 300–500 bp. Genomic DNA was prepared by treating aliquots of chromatin with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , proteinase K and heat for de-crosslinking , followed <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> precipitation .	76 77	66	0	None
Sections were then rinsed with DEPC and RNase inhibitor ( 0.5 U/µl , BioLabs <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) -treated PBS , incubated with NeuN ( 1∶10 , Millipore , MAB377 ) for 1 min at room temperature ( RT ) , and washed with DEPC- and RNase inhibitor treated PBS two times . We then incubated the sections with Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG1 ( γ1 ) ( 1∶10 , Invitrogen , A21123 ) in DEPC- and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor treated PBS and washed two times with DEPC- and RNase inhibitor treated PBS .

A recent report claimed that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( IFN-α and lymphotoxin beta ( LT-β ) pathways might cause the destruction of cccDNA by certain endonucleases following deamination of the minus strand DNA by <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and A3B .	5 6	5 6	33 34	None
In this case , because HBeAg was detected and HBV DNA was still high 3 months after administration of clevudin , it should be clarified that the mutations in the overlapping frame gene regions , S codon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( P codons P221T and A222T ) , may be associated with escape mutation as well as drug resistance . An interesting point of this case concerns the sustained HCV suppression , which occurred even with insufficient treatment of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	77	77	37	None
In addition to these patients , we investigated the plasma and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> concentrations of four other NSCLC patients with CNS metastases ( cases 5–8 ) ( Table ) .Patient characteristics Cases Age ( yr ) Sex PS Histology EGFR gene Smoking status Previous chemotherapy regimen Previous <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( length of PFS ) Previous WBRT 1 59 F 3 Ad NE Never 3 Yes ( 10 months ) Yes 2 82 F 4 Ad Wild type Never 0 No No 3 70 F 3 Ad Wild type Never 1 No Yes 4 86 F 3 Ad Ex 21 ; <ANNO_TYPE_variant> Never 1 Yes ( 7 months ) No 5 67 F 1 Ad Ex 21 ; L858R Never 1 No No 6 72 M 0 Ad Ex 21 ; L858R Former 1 No No 7 81 M 1 Ad Ex 19 deletion Former 1 Yes ( 46 months ) Yes 8 85 F 2 Ad Ex 21 ; L858R Never 1 No Yes a 66 F 1 Ad Ex 21 ; L858R Never 3 No Yes	46	11	98	None
In addition , the case indicates that extended <ANNO_TYPE_drug> exposure in the systemic lung cancer sites was associated with the development of a systemic <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation , whereas CNS metastases did not undergo this secondary change . Ruppert et al. reported a case of a lung adenocarcinoma with a sensitive EGFR mutation in which the patient developed brain metastases with carcinomatous meningitis and liver metastasis after he stopped taking EGFR-TKI [ ] . Since a secondary T790M mutation was found on a liver biopsy , but not in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , the patient received erlotinib , and the brain metastasis responded well to treatment .	8	90	24	None
At the end of LPS treatment , microglia were washed twice with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and incubated with Nec-1 , butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , SP600125 , or corresponding vehicle for 1 h before the induction of necrosis with zVAD-fmk addition . Microglia were then collected with ice-cold PBS at 1 h ( RNA extraction ) and 3 h ( protein preparation ) post zVAD-fmk treatment . Vehicles used were PBS for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , DMSO for zVAD-fmk , Nec-1 , and SP600125 , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for BHA , and these were used at the same final concentration volume ( & lt ; 0.1 % ) as the corresponding reagent .	83	71	12	None
Bacterial endotoxins , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and collagenase PrtC protein are important virulence factors that elicit host immune responses and result in tissue lesions . For example , encoding genes of enzymes that mediate sulfur and peroxide metabolism were under represented in the H-2 group . These enzymes include CysN/D/H/J/I , which deoxidizes sulfate to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and PatB , MetB/C and CysK/M/O , which catalyze H2S to the reductive carboxylate cycle and Cys/Met metabolism , as well as CAT , which catabolizes toxic substances ( e.g. , H2O2 , formaldehyde , phenol and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) .	92	3	53	None

A further portion was purified for high resolution mass spectrometry by HPLC ( Atlantis C18 column ; 150 × 4.6 mm , 5 μm particles ) and a mobile phase comprising a mixture of 92 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 100 mM NH4OAc , pH 5.0 ) ( 85 + 15 , v/v ) and 8 % chloroform at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1 ( isocratic elution ) . The effluent of the HPLC was divided using a splitter ( Active splitter , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , Agilent , USA ) which directed 1/5 of the flow to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and the remainder to a fraction collector which collected 1.5 mL volumes .	35 36	97	83	None
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is most common ( comprising 50 % of mutations ) . KIT gene amplification also occurs [ , ] .

Several mutations in the kinase domains such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , T674I , S601P and L629P , have been demonstrated to be responsible for the drug-resistance . Of note , the “gate-keeper” mutant T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , similar to T315I Bcr-Abl in CML , was also refractory to some second-generation TKIs , such <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , sorafenib .	53 54	35	8	None
KIT is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase that initiates multiple downstream signaling pathways , such as the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and JAK/STAT pathways . KIT gene mutations are mainly found in melanomas , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is an effective inhibitor of this oncogene . Here , we observed mutations <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and V559A , which are the most common KIT mutation types .	33	18	47	None
A , EOL-1 cells and BaF3 cells harboring WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα were incubated with indicated concentrations of DCC-2036 for 24 h ( EOL-1 ) or 36 h ( BaF3-WT and -T674I mutant ) , the phosphorylated and total levels of PDGFRα , STAT3 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and Erk1/2 were analyzed by immunoblotting . B , EOL-1 cells and BaF3 cells expressing WT or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> FIP1L1-PDGFRα were treated with DCC-2036 for indicated durations with different concentrations ( 6 nM for EOL-1 cells , 400 nM for BaF3 cells ) , the phosphorylated and total levels of indicated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting .

To explore potential <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance mechanisms in model EC039 , we screened for mutations in a panel of genes ( EGFR , K-ras , B-raf and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) across all 5 PDECX models and their corresponding patient EC tissues . Screened gene locations included ; exons 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 of EGFR gene , exons 2 and 3 of K-ras gene , exons 11 and 15 of B-raf gene , and exons 9 and 20 of PI3KCA gene . Interestingly , PIK3CA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( E542K ) mutation was identified within exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene helical domain in both EC039 model and the corresponding patient’s EC tissue .	3	26	85	None
The group also demonstrated that HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines with activating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and H1047R ) are more resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than are HER2 positive cell lines without those mutations ( Berns et al. , ; Kataoka et al. , ) .	24	13	16	None
Another approach for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance is the dual inhibition of EGFR with afatinib and cetuximab , an <ANNO_TYPE_gene> blocking antibody resembling the synergistic combination of lapatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in ErbB2 positive breast cancer .	28	18	3	None
The relatively low incidence of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and ALK aberrations in non-Asian patients , however , account for the fact that ∼87 % of patients with NSCLC still receive conventional chemotherapy with no suitable biomarkers for therapy selection . The same accounts for women with triple negative breast cancer who do not benefit from anti-hormonal therapy or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and for whom effective treatment is limited [ ] . Other examples of useful biomarkers are KRAS mutation testing to predict benefit from monoclonal antibodies against EGFR , cetuximab and panitumumab , in metastatic colon cancer [ ] and BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation analysis in metastatic melanoma in order to predict responsiveness to BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib [ ] .	56	5	97	None
Our results for the CT and TT MTHFR genotypes were null , although the ORs below one that we observed are consistent with one meta-analysis ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> et al. , ) , while another shows no association between the MTHFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism and prostate cancer risk ( Collin et al. , ) . Although this is a relatively small study that lacked power to detect most interactions , our finding of an over two-fold increase in prostate cancer risk for the interaction of low folate and high <ANNO_TYPE_drug> intake is consistent biologically with prostate carcinogenesis resulting from folate deficiency ( Bistulfi et al. , ) .	87	26	40	None
One limitation of this study is that having genotyped only one mitochondrial variant , we are unable to categorize the participants of this study into well defined mitochondrial haplogroups as done by <ANNO_TYPE_gene> et al . However given the prior work published on the non-synonymous A10398G ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) polymorphism in the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) and breast cancer risk – coupled with the possibility of its putative function , we feel that the a priori hypothesis of an interaction <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> consumption and the A10398G polymorphism on breast cancer risk is relatively strong .	82 83	32	47	None
Surprisingly , the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation leads to decreased ability to activate <ANNO_TYPE_gene> compared to WT EGFR which correlates with decreased EGFR internalization , reduced phosphorylation of SHP2 , hyperactivity of STAT3 and reduced sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	36	12	4	None
EGFR gene mutations indicate sensitivity to gefitinib , and it was demonstrated that about 85 % of patients with NSCLC who obtained benefit from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment were found to have mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene [ - ] . EGFR mutations in exon 19 ( short in-frame deletions ) or 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( point mutation ) affect the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain leading to the activation of 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds , which function to compete with ATP [ ] . Anti-EGFR therapy can consequently lead to the downregulation of downstream signaling cascades , such as the PI3K/Akt , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , MAPK , and STAT pathways , responsible for cell proliferation and survival , resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis , respectively .	24	114	61	None

The results of a small study of 74 patients , conducted by Loupakis with his colleagues , suggested that rare KRAS mutations in codon 61 and in codon 146 might also be responsible for in the treatment resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. , In contrast , in their large retrospective analysis , De Roock et al. concluded that the codon 146 mutations did not affect the response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and that the patients with codon 61 mutant tumours had lower response rate . According to the analysis of other mutations , they proposed testing of KRAS status , if not mutated , then of BRAF and NRAS status , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> exon 20 mutation in order to improve the objective response up to 40 % in selected patients . In our retrospective study , 26.7 % of patients , all with KRAS wild-type tumours , who had previously unresectable liver-only metastases , underwent surgical resection after systemic therapy , with R0 resection achieved in 38 patients ( 21.6 % ) ; one of those was patient with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	68	110	179	None
Key genomic features of these tumors involve inactivation of tumor suppressors such as APC , TP53 and SMAD4 and mutational activation of oncogenes including KRAS , NRAS , BRAF and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] .

Analogous secondary mutations of the BCR-ABL gene in case of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) [ ] and the KIT gene in case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor [ ] have previously been reported as mechanisms of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance , which is also a TKI . The structural similarity between ABL and EGFR tyrosine kinases is considerably high , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in ABL corresponds to T790M in EGFR [ ] . Using <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells , Azam et al. revealed that a gatekeeper threonine mutation stabilizes an active conformation of these tyrosine kinases through a network of hydrophobic interactions known as the hydrophobic spine and has a transforming function [ ] .The authors anticipated that this regulatory mechanism would be conserved across the kinase family .	37	72	60	None

In fact , the pleiotropic effect of BCR/ABL transformation is mostly dependent on post-translational modifications ( e.g. phosphorylation ) of signalling molecules , like those involved in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , PI3K/Akt and STATs pathways , which control cell growth , survival and differentiation of haematopoietic cells by modulating the expression and/or activity of downstream effectors ( ; ) ( ) . Being the deregulated BCR/ABL kinase activity the cause of CML , targeting its catalytic domain was the most rationale approach for the rational development of small molecules that inhibit ABL kinase activity . In these CML-BC patients , imatinib resistance often depends on reactivation of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase activity via mechanisms involving BCR/ABL overexpression , gene amplification or mutations that suppress imatinib mediated kinase inhibition ( i.e. <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and G250E ) or disrupt <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding ( i.e. T315I ) ( ) .	134	28	128	None
In contrast , we have demonstrated that the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and PD153035 ( a specific EGFR TKI ) proved to be antagonistic in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell line , with no reduction in proliferation and EGFR , HER2 , AKT and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> phosphorylation status when compared to either drug alone [ ] .	10	40	24	None
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR is structurally analogous to drug resistance mutations in other kinases such as BCR-ABL ( T315I ) , c-KIT ( T670I ) and platelet derived growth factor receptor-α ( PDGFRα ) ( T674I ) [ ] . Furthermore , acquired resistance may be mediated by activation of redundant signaling pathways able to bypass the blockade of single proteins involved in cancer cells proliferation , survival , or migration . Having again the EGFR inhibitors as a paradigm , this is the case of K-Ras mutations leading to constitutive activation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signaling pathway and mediating both intrinsic or acquired resistance to the anti-EGFR mAb <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in colorectal cancers [ ] .	109	95	1	None
In vivo efficacy was described only for the L1196M gatekeeper mutation , confirming a higher potency with respect to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in inhibiting the in vivo growth of ALK–L1196M driven <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells . For the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant , activity in Ba/F3 cells was not described , but the compound was able to effectively inhibit proliferation of a neuroblastoma cell line naturally bearing the mutation .	19	29	34	None
When tested in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells driven by ALK mutants identified in crizotinib relapsed patients , NMS-E628 is circa fivefold more potent than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in inhibiting the proliferation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ALK and C1156Y ALK-driven-cells in vitro and in vivo ( Ardini et al. , ) .	22	3	28	None

H1975 cells [ TKI-resistant , EGFR exon 20 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and -21 mutations ] were treated for 24 h with either dasatinib ( 200 nM ) , 17-DMAG ( 50 nM ) , belinostat ( 500 nM ) , panobinostat ( 50 nM ) or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 10 nM ) . Lysates were made , western blotted and probed with antibody against EGFR and GAPDH ( loading control ) ( A ) . 17-DMAG and belinostat decreased levels of activated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( p-Akt ) in TKI-resistant cells .	46	81	9	None
JTE013 blocked <ANNO_TYPE_variant> induced Akt activation in both cell lines , supporting the findings using AC expression to drive increased S1P signaling . AC promotes chemotherapy resistance , but confers sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibition Cytotoxic chemotherapy depends , in part , on ceramide accumulation to cause cell death. , , PPC1 cells were subjected to a wide dose range of the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , Gemcitabine and 5′-Fluorouracil .	64	32	2	None
In patients chronically infected by HCV , a significant increase in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> expression was seen in hepatocytes and in lymphocytes [ ] . Overexpression of APOBEC has also been observed in HCV/HBV coinfection [ ] . APOBEC3 also appears to play an important role on treatment with exogenous <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( IFNα ) in vivo .	48 49	48 49	11	None
In this case , because HBeAg was detected and HBV DNA was still high 3 months after administration of clevudin , it should be clarified that the mutations in the overlapping frame gene regions , S codon L213I ( P codons <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and A222T ) , may be associated with escape mutation as well as drug resistance . An interesting point of this case concerns the sustained HCV suppression , which occurred even with insufficient treatment of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	77	77	41	None

Further TKI improvement came from the higher binding affinity and selectivity than imatinib through the follow-up substance <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) [ ] . In addition , bosutinib ( SKI-606 ) was developed , a second line inhibitor which has the broadest target spectrum inhibiting SRC , ABL and TEC , as well as serine kinases CAMK2G and STE20 , but bosutinib does not target PDGFR and KIT [ , ] . Finally , the third line inhibitor ponatinib has been developed and shown to exhibit substantial efficacy in patients with CML in whom the polyresistant BCR-ABL1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is expressed in leukemic cells [ ] .	17	19	97	None
The demonstration that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Imatinib mesylate ) , an Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor licensed for the treatment of several cancer forms [ ] , is a poxvirus blocker [ ] and the repurposing of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase inhibitor U0126 to block the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade for influenza virus inhibition [ , ] serve as cases in point . While the former originated from the insight that efficient vaccinia virus spread requires phosphorylation of the viral <ANNO_TYPE_variant> protein by Abl and Src family tyrosine kinases [ , ] , the latter was triggered by the observation that influenza virus infection induces the activation of MAPK family members [ , ] .	3	36	75	None
In one NHL , we also found <ANNO_TYPE_variant> BRAF mutation that has also been detected in colon tumours previously . The most impressive examples of recent cancer therapies used protein kinase inhibitors such as Imanitib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) ( ) . Since <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase pathway is activated by protein kinase , therapies that target this signalling pathway would therefore be very valuable in treating tumours that have activating mutations of BRAF .	36	42	7	None

One such challenge with kinase inhibitors is the development of drug resistance , and particularly appearance of “gatekeeper” mutations that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding . Acquired inhibitor resistance is a serious complication in cancer treatment , where the objective is a chronic maintenance of tumor control rather than a “quick fix” .

Median OS was 27 months and the multivariate analysis found that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , male sex , the presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , brain metastases , and bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma were associated with poor prognosis . Until now , there have been no published randomized trials of EGFR TKIs vs chemotherapy as first-line therapy for NSCLC patients from Western countries ; however , 2 integrative studies of phase II trials support the findings of the SLCG and promote the role of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as first-line therapy for patients with NSCLC carrying EGFR mutations .	81	11 12	21	None

In spite of recent improvements in NSCLC management , such as the use of targeted therapy including <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , which have led to improved progression-free survival and quality of life in NSCLC patients with an activating EGFR mutation , progression or metastasis because of resistance to targeted therapy remains a major clinical problem . Apart from <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and c-MET amplification , a recent study has reported that Axl kinase is upregulated in humans with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI . Axl may drive cancer cell growth through activation of multiple pathways , such as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , AKT and NF-κB , and Axl mediated EGFR-TKI acquired resistance may occur during EMT ; however , Axl mediated molecular alterations in TKI-resistant NSCLC are largely unknown .	17	95	58	None
EGFR gene mutations indicate sensitivity to gefitinib , and it was demonstrated that about 85 % of patients with NSCLC who obtained benefit from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment were found to have mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene [ - ] . EGFR mutations in exon 19 ( short in-frame deletions ) or 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( point mutation ) affect the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain leading to the activation of 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds , which function to compete with ATP [ ] . Anti-EGFR therapy can consequently lead to the downregulation of downstream signaling cascades , such as the PI3K/Akt , RAS/Erk , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and STAT pathways , responsible for cell proliferation and survival , resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis , respectively .	24	116	61	None

In contrast , no significant changes in the phosphorylation of CENP-A were observed in tumour tissues from mice treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , suggesting that 212Pb-TCMC-trastuzumab may interfere with the affinity of BubR1 for kinetocores , thus perturbing the mitotic spindle checkpoint induced by paclitaxel . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is involved in DNA replication , DNA repair and mitosis , suggesting <ANNO_TYPE_gene> affects cell cycle progression both at S-phase and during mitosis .	20	58	45	None
It was not only found that 5-FU-resistant cells expressed significant higher levels of miR-34a , but also that the introduction of miR-34a into resistant cells significantly inhibited cell growth and induced a considerable attenuation of 5-FU-resistance , which was accompanied by reduced expression of SIRT1 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family proteins . These findings suggest that the resistance to 5-FU in DLD-1 cells was at least in part mediated by <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cascade .

To date , only four studies have found significant association between these polymorphisms and the clinical outcome . In 64 chemorefractory MCRC patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based CT , found that the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> 131 H/H and FCGR3A 158 V/V genotypes , predicted to result in a higher affinity of the Ig to the receptor , were significantly associated with better PFS .	63	70	3	None

The <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and MALAT1 associations in the discovery set also were supported by the validation set analysis . Druggable gene analysis We defined mutations in druggable tyrosine kinase domains including in ERBB2 ( a V777L and a 755–759 LRENT in frame deletion homologous <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> activating EGFR mutations in lung cancer ) , as well as in DDR1 ( A829V , R611C ) , DDR2 ( E583D ) , CSF1R ( D735H <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , and PDGFRA ( E924K ) .	43 44	1	72 73	None
For example , detecting the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in blood samples would be useful for patient selection for treatment with new EGFR-TKIs for lung cancers that are resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib [ ] . Recent two studies suggest other possibilities of ctDNA analysis . Dawson et al. followed the dynamics of ctDNA in metastatic breast cancer patients using mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and/or PIK3CA , and found its merit for monitoring disease progression [ ] .	28	60	5	None
Nevertheless the percentage of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells which were arrested in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> phase of the cell cycle , after treatment with the selected , cytostatic concentrations of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , was comparable to the one observed in control L5 cells .	27	10 11	4	None
Our studies with serum-free media showed that the presence of CD26/DPPIV was still associated with enhanced sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and etoposide , by influencing the key components of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> checkpoint following drug treatment .	18	28 29	29	None

The increased inhibition potency for Erlotinib against the oncogenic EGFR L858R mutant ( over the EGFR WT protein ) correlates with decreased global connectivity of the hub residues ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , Glu-884 , Gln-894 and Asp-896 ) in the mutant ( – wild type , – L858R mutant ) . The subsequent decrease in potency for Erlotinib against the oncogenic EGFR L858R + E884K double mutant correlates well with the increased global connectivity of the hub residues ( – wild type , – L858R + E884K mutant ) . On the other hand , the increased inhibition potency for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> against EGFR L858R mutant ( compared to EGFR WT protein ) and subsequent further increase in potency for Gefitinib against the EGFR L858R + <ANNO_TYPE_variant> double mutant correlates well with the increased global connectivity of the hub residues in the mutants ( – wild type , – L858R , – L858R + E884K ) .	99	29	124	None
However , factor V Leiden , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and the MTHFR mutation are either absent or irrelevant in the Asian population , – .

The DNA in the water phase was subsequently <ANNO_TYPE_drug> precipitated . After centrifugation , the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM EDTA ( pH 8.0 ) , and frozen at −20 °C until further analysis .

To verify that these pronounced frequency shifts of the probe report on the loss of the hydrogen bond to W1 , we solved x-ray structures of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> bound to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> bearing mutations at either T338 or A403 . Methionine is the most common gatekeeper residue in human kinases , but the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant of Src yielded small crystals that diffracted x-rays poorly .	26	29	51	None
Although irreversible inhibitors of the EGFR such as dacomitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in vitro their clinical activity in the setting of tumors with T790M mutations remains to be demonstrated and novel mutation specific T790M inhibitors are in clinical development . A second mechanism for resistance which is seen in 5–20 % of patients is amplification of CMET which causes resistance to EGFR TKIs by activating PI3 Kinase signaling through <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ , ,, ] .	10	70	12	None
Poziotinib ( also known as HM781-36B ) , a new potent irreversible inhibitor of EGFR , HER2 , HER4 , and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood family of kinases inhibitor ( BTK , BLK , and BMX ) , demonstrated preclinical efficacy against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant at eightfold lower doses compared to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A different approach in addressing EGFR-TKI resistance involves the use of combination regimens . Therefore , the combination of erlotinib with cetuximab , and the combination of erlotinib with MM-121 ( a fully human mAb that targets <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) , in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs did not show sufficient clinical activity for further investigation in this population .	50	89	42	None

<ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation reviewed in . The second well-known mechanism of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance is the MET receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) gene amplification .

While the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation represents a direct mechanism for drug resistance that occurs at the level of drug accessibility to the target , there are a number of indirect mechanisms that involve the increased expression or activation of alternative growth factor receptors to maintain signal flux , despite EGFR inhibition . Perhaps the best characterized of these is the amplification of the Met receptor and/or elevated levels of its ligand HGF . In <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant NSCLC cell lines , Met drives ErbB3 dependent activation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway .	73	86	2	None
We finally examined cells expressing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant of BCR/ABL , which is resistant not only to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> but also to dasatinib or nilotinib . We first examined the effect of the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib , which we found to inhibit the kinase activity of BCR/ABL including the T315I mutant . As shown in , sorafenib much more significantly enhanced etoposide induced apoptosis of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells when they were driven by the T315I mutant as compared with when cultured with IL-3 , which correlated with its inhibitory activity on Chk1 activation as well as on phosphorylation of the BCR/ABL substrate STAT5 and GSK3 .	17	64	6	None
In western blot experiments , we observed that IM was unable to decrease the expression of the mature form of T670I c-Kit mutant , while the wt form of the receptor decreased in UT-7/Epo or in wt-c-Kit <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells ( ) . As expected , the expression of the mature form of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> c-Kit mutant was down regulated in the presence of sorafenib . These data indicate that the accessibility of the ATP pocket is crucial for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced c-Kit internalization process .	77	37	52	None

Efforts to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> reaction intermediates lead to characterization of an important intermediate state E4 that carries four electrons stored as two [ Fe–H–Fe ] bridging hydrides and two protons bound to the sulfides on the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The currently proposed reaction scheme that predicts the E4 state suggests that the coupling between electron and proton transfers is too tight to be discriminated . In contrast , we succeeded to identify the sequential electron and proton transfer steps on the NB-protein in the DPOR reaction , by blocking of the proton transfer step using <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and Chl c .	35	2	93	None

For example , imatinib is effective in treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with gene rearrangements that constitutively activate PDGFRB [ ] , of hypereosinophilic syndrome with activating mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] , and of gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors associated with activating mutations in KIT [ ] ( all reviewed in [ ] ) . More recently , this paradigm has been extended to treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Several mutations have been identified in the context of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with NSCLC that are associated with clinical response to the small-molecule EGFR inhibitors <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Iressa ) or erlotinib ( Tarceva ) [ , , ] , including in-frame deletions such as del L747–E749 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 19 , or L858R in exon 21 .	103	29	124 125	None
Metformin , like rapamycin , virtually abolished mTORC1 activation induced by insulin and neurotensin in PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells ( pS6K , pS6 in ) without changing the total levels of either <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or S6 . However , metformin did not over stimulated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> phosphorylation on Ser473 in the PDAC cells ( p-Akt473 in ) , a result strikingly different from that obtained with rapamycin and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	66	43	32	None
Further research is looking into inhibiting other targets such as mTOR , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathways .

Lazzara and colleagues found that SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation was not induced in response to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in the H3255 cells , which harbor the missense <ANNO_TYPE_variant> exon 21 mutation , suggesting that SHP2 activity may be less efficiently promoted by EGFR L858R and the STAT3 pathway may be more active . The main problem is that STAT3 activation is not abrogated by single EGFR TKI treatment with gefitinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , afatinib or dacomitinib , - .	68	14	24	None
shows that the side chain groups of the mutated residues Lys and the protonated <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at position 19 of the WT substrate ( in mutants R19K and R19Hp ) also form HB interactions with the side chain carboxylate group of the PKA residue Glu170 , while the mutated residue histidine δ at the same position 19 ( in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) also forms an HB interaction with the side chain carboxylate group of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> residue Glu203 ( ) .	14	74	58 59	None
To prepare the mutants , we mutated arginines of the WT sequence inside the transformed <ANNO_TYPE_gene> model and obtained the models that contain PKA and the peptides LARASLG ( R18A ) , LRAASLG ( R19A ) , LKRASLG ( R18K ) , LRKASLG ( R19K ) , LHRASLG ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , and LRHASLG ( R19H ) . We also prepared the models including the shorter chain peptides RRASLG , RASLG , and LRRASL . For the mutants that contain histidine we prepared the models containing neutral histidine with the hydrogen atoms at position δ or ε ( Hδ and Hε ) , and the models containing the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> Hp ( see the next section ) .	108 109	15	49	None
Such discrepancy can be explained by the difference in the nature of the substituted amino-acid ( cysteine in one case and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the other ) or by differences in experimental conditions ( whole-cell configuration on oocytes and giant-patch configuration on COS-7 cells , respectively ) . Furthermore , Matavel et al. showed that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and R243C mutants exhibited an impaired activation by both <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and PKC , whereas C-terminal KCNQ1 mutants presented an increased activation .	21	64	54	None

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib belong to the first generation of TKIs and have reversible binding features . The principal predictive factor for response to such drugs is the presence of somatic “activating” mutations in the EGFR gene that cause an aberrant and constitutive activation of the receptor at the membrane level , resulting in a growth advantage of tumor cells through the activation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , PI3K/Akt , and STAT signaling pathways . In about 50 % of cases , a secondary mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is supposed to be responsible for resistance. , Other mechanisms involve MET gene amplification ( 5 % –20 % ) ,	0	63	83	None

Western blot : Treated cells were lysed with 2× sample buf-fer ( 4 % w/v SDS , 20 % glycerol , 200 mM DTT , 0.1 M Tris-HCl , pH 6.8 , and 0.02 % bromophenol blue ) and the samples were fractionated by 8-12 % SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose ( NC ) membrane . The NC membrane was blocked with 1 μg/ml <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> (PVA) for 0.5 hr at room temperature ( RT ) and incubated overnight at 4℃ with the appropriate primary antibodies which were diluted <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> : 5000 in 5 % skim milk ( Roth , Germany ) .	93 94	118 119	6	None
The PVA ( polyvinyl <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) was used as low-dielectric insulating films with a thickness of 20 nm or 50 nm to sandwich the donor : acceptor ( PVK : TCNB ) composite film with the device architecture of ITO/PVA/PVK : TCNB/PVA/Al to explore polarization and transport contributions during the generation of magneto-capacitance . The magneto-capacitance measurements were performed on the fabricated devices located in a magnetic field by using an Agilent <ANNO_TYPE_variant> LCR meter with zero DC bias and 50 mV AC field <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Hz .	4	84 85	72	None
There was no significant difference in the levels of TG , HDL-C , ApoA1 , ApoB , and the ratio of ApoA1 to ApoB between AA and AG genotypes in the both groups ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ; 0.05 for all ) . Interactions between genotypes and alcohol consumption on serum lipid parameters The interactions between genotypes of the PCSK9 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> consumption on serum TC and LDL-C levels are also shown in Table .	61	34 35	59	None
However , 0.5 % v/v <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was unable to increase the invasive ability of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells overexpressing Nm23 ( Figure , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ; 0.05 ) , suggesting that Nm23 expression is critical in alcohol induced T47D breast cancer cell invasion .	5	21 22	14	None
AKT is a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> known as a main effector of PI3K signaling . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation induces an upstream-signal independent constitutive activation of AKT and resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	27	3	14	None
BRAF ( v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 ) , a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , is the downstream effector of KRAS in the RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway . A somatic mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in exon 15 of BRAF has been identified in multiple human cancers with a mutation rate of 66 % in malignant melanomas [ ] and at lower frequency in other human carcinomas . Recently , it was demonstrated that wildtype BRAF is required for the response of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab [ ] .	86	12 13	31	None
Also in advanced phase of disease , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was found to be active in mutated patients . Ponatinib A third generation inhibitor was recently tested in resistant/intolerant CML patients : ponatinib is a potent , synthetic , oral multi-target <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor able to block native and mutated BCR/ABL , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , resistant to dasatinib and nilotinib .	7	39	50	None
There was no correlation between the cellular activity of sorafenib and BRAF ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) . Another important class of kinase inhibitor drugs are those targeting ABL1 , of which a re-arranged form , i.e. , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , drives Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) . Imatinib , nilotinib , dasatinib , ponatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> are approved drugs for this indication .	57	36	13	None
A similar clinical benefit is observed in patients with lung cancers harboring the two most common EGFR activating mutations , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and exon 19 deletions [ – , ] . The striking initial response to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors is thought to stem from the phenomenon of “oncogene addiction” [ ] , and a common signaling cascade may be involved in the apoptosis induced by multiple TKIs [ ] . Rapid inactivation of phosphorylated ERK , AKT , and STAT3/5 , and the delayed accumulation of phosphorylated p38 are commonly observed in SRC- , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and EGFR dependent cells after exposure to the specific inhibitors SU6655 , imatinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , respectively [ ] .	112	95	20	None
A similar “gatekeeper” mutation ( T315I ) in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> fusion kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia cancer cells renders these leukemias resistant to the ABL kinase inhibitors gleevec and dasatinib , suggesting a conserved mechanism of resistance to TKIs [ ] . However , the T790 M mutation may also occur prior to treatment with erlotinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and therefore , may contribute to primary resistance [ ] . Several other EGFR mutations can also confer resistance to first generation TKIs such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T854A [ , ] .	57	9	83	None
Further studies of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> revealed that this 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor , structurally similar to erlotinib , binds the EGFR c.2573T & gt ; G ( L858R ) mutant with a 20-fold higher affinity compared to the wild-type enzyme . Both mutations , the activating EGFR c.2573T & gt ; G ( L858R ) and the inhibiting EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ; T ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) were found in our cytological assessment .	3	56	60	None

In addition , the IC50 values for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> were 0.5 to 30nM in parental cells and 30 to more than 300nM in resistant cells . As a whole our findings confirmed the efficacy of ponatinib on the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , but also highlighted the notion that ponatinib is effective on all types of imatinib-resistant CML cells , whatever their mode of resistance . Importantly , the IC50 values obtained for ponatinib in the present study for BaF3-WT-BCR-ABL , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and BaF3-G250E-BCR-ABL ( 1nM , 8nM and 8nM respectively ) were very similar to the one reported previously by O’ Hare et al.

Moreover , as shown in , SHP2 physically associated with PECAM-1 more prominently in cells expressing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or T315I mutant as compared with cells expressing native BCR/ABL , while these mutants had less significant effects on complex formation between SHP2 and Gab2 . We next examined the effect of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> on tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells expressing the T315I mutant , which is totally resistant to dasatinib as well as imatinib but sensitive to the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib ( , ) .	50	57	17	None

Transient transfection experiments utilizing COS-7 cells demonstrated that auto-phosphorylation of the original <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR was inhibited by lower concentrations of gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than the L858R-L747S or L858R-T790M constructs ( A ) . CL-387,785 partially overcame the observed inhibition ( B ) . To prove the functional significance of the L747S mutation , we generated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cell lines stably expressing mutant EGFR constructs [ ] .	22	55	12	None
However , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> did induce dose dependent cell death in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> subclones expressing the EGFR ectodomain mutants ( missense and vIII truncation ) or EGFR kinase domain mutants ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L861Q ) ( A ) .	2	10	29	None
For example , imatinib is effective in treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with gene rearrangements that constitutively activate PDGFRB [ ] , of hypereosinophilic syndrome with activating mutations in PDGFRA [ ] , and of gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors associated with activating mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] ( all reviewed in [ ] ) . More recently , this paradigm has been extended to treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Several mutations have been identified in the context of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with NSCLC that are associated with clinical response to the small-molecule EGFR inhibitors gefitinib ( Iressa ) or erlotinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) [ , , ] , including in-frame deletions such as del L747–E749 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 19 , or L858R in exon 21 .	110	44	124 125	None

It was initially proposed that the T790M mutation might prevent the proper binding of tyrosine kinase inhibitors via steric hindrance , similar to the corresponding gatekeeper mutations in BCR-ABL ( T315I ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( T670I ) that confer resistance to imatinib ( Gleevec ) in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors . Interestingly , it was discovered that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation does not confer resistance to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by preventing their binding as originally thought .	73	33	64	None
In addition , no support was found for interactions between <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and A2AR , or A1 and mGlu5 , suggesting this reduction in alcohol self-administration and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> seeking behavior was specific to a functional interaction between <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and mGlu5 receptors ( Adams et al. , , ) .	27	10 11	37	None

These physiological effects of adenosine are mediated by a family of four G-protein coupled receptors : A1 , A2A , A2B , and A3 ( A1R , A2AR , A2BR , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , each of which has a unique pharmacological profile , tissue distribution , and effector coupling [ ] . Recently , Peng et al. reported that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mediated increases in extracellular adenosine , which act via <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and A2BR , link the ingestion and metabolism of ethanol to the development of hepatic steatosis .	60	70 71	32	None

This findings show that EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is a common resistance mechanism to both reversible , and when amplified , the irreversible EGFR inhibitors . In our case , the response duration of irreversible EGFR inhibitor was 11 months which was unusually longer than those of initial <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( for 4 months ) and second round gefitinib ( for 6 months ) treatments . Recently an alternative approach is to develop novel strategies , instead of irreversible EGFR inhibitors , to inhibit EGFR and/or EGFR signaling , including the use of inhibitors of HSP90 and/or EGFR downstream signaling ( such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors ) as these resistant cancers still remain dependent on EGFR signaling for their growth .	46	103	5	None
Compared with mitochondrial <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , which resides within the monoamine oxidase protein [ ] , the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> preferring imidazoline binding sites ( known as I1R ) are localized to plasma membrane fractions [ , ] and specifically to synaptic plasma membranes [ ] . A strong candidate for I1R , known as imidazoline receptor antisera selected protein ( IRAS ) , has been cloned from human hippocampus [ ] . hIRAS is a larger protein of 1504 amino acids consisting of an NH2-terminal phox ( PX ) domain , 5 putative <ANNO_TYPE_gene> repeats , a predicted coiled-coil domain , and a long COOH-terminal region .	16	91	3	None

For combination experiments , cells were treated as described above , plus 4 h of incubation with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 10 μg ml−1 ) , or 1 h of incubation with PD98059 ( 25 μM ) or PD153035 ( 0.1 μM ) alone or combined with cetuximab before the incubation with EGF . As <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells express low levels of EGFR , more protein was loaded ( 80 μg , as opposed to 50 μg for the other cells ) on the gels to observe the phosphorylation status of the receptor . Primary antibodies against total and phosphorylated EGFR , HER2 , AKT and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( all from Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA , USA ) were used .	17	103	53	None
cDzT cleaves EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mRNA , which leads to a decrease in EGFR protein levels , whereas <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is a second-line TKI that irreversibly binds to the intracellular kinase domain of EGFR and suppresses its downstream signaling . A recent report showed that EGFR support of cancer cell survival is independent of its kinase activity , suggesting that a TKI alone could not achieve maximum therapeutic efficacy . In addition to its pivotal role in signaling pathways , EGFR also interacts with and stabilizes the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> to maintain intracellular glucose levels , which prevents against autophagic cell death .	17	85 86 87	3	None

As shown in Figure , all putative ER , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and CREB binding sites on Trip10 promoter were enriched for H3K4me3 , but not H3K27me3 , confirming that Trip10 expression is regulated by both DNA methylation and histone modification . A comparison of endogenous Trip10 mRNA expression in these tested cell lines is correspondingly shown in Additional File : Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . To further evaluate the role of DNA methylation , IMR-32 cells were treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 5-Aza ) , which appeared to suppress DNA methylation in GSTp1 and slightly decrease Trip10 DNA methylation in the first exon region ( Figure upper panel ) .	77	9	61	None

We confirmed expression for all the Gal4-BD fusions , but a few Gal4-AD fusion were very weak or could not be detected , indicating that the number of interactors might be underestimated for ARF9 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , IAA11 , IAA20 and IAA30 .	13	107	24	None

However , mutations of the PP1 binding motif not only affect BRCA1 interaction with PP1α but may also reduce BRCA1 dephosphorylation as the PP1 binding motif deleted BRCA1 protein ( BRCA1GFP DEL ) displayed increased S1423 phosphorylation at the basal level and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment when expressed in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ovarian cancer cell line . BRCA1 interacts with many proteins , and it is possible that inappropriate phosphorylation patterns may affect these interactions , thereby impacting other BRCA1 functions such as transcription or E3 ubiquitin ligase activity . These additional adverse effects to BRCA1 function may underlie the DNA repair deficiencies observed for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	42 43	49	103	None
Similarly , the analysis of oncogenic signaling pathway showed that older patients have a lower probability of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and PI3-kinase pathway activation , but a higher probability of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , TNF , Src , and EPI pathway activation .

Jin et al also reported that the HDAC inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , inhibits HDAC activity by downregulating cyclin D1 protein expression in colonic carcinoma cells in xenografted mice . In conclusion , our study confirms that valproic acid significantly suppresses growth of Kasumi-1 cell xenograft tumors in nude mice via cell cycle arrest . The antitumor activity of valproic acid is possibly attributable to its direct downregulation of cyclin D1 , CDK4/6 , and cyclin E1 expression , blockage of Rb phosphorylation , reduction of free <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , inhibition of HDAC activity , attenuation of histone acetylation in the p21 promoter region , upregulation of p21 expression , and induction of cell cycle arrest .	10	86	86	None

Rapamycin and rapalogs ( everolimus , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) can slow the proliferation of cancer cell lines and have achieved some success in specific malignancies [ , ] . Unfortunately , however , their overall efficacy as cancer therapeutics has been limited . The major drawbacks of rapalogs are : 1 ) <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is exquisitely inhibited , yet the control of 4EBP and mRNA translation is far less sensitive [ , ] ; 2 ) TORC2 activity is not acutely blocked ( though it can be suppressed upon sustained exposure [ ] ) ; 3 ) the loss of a feedback inhibition pathway mediated by S6K results in amplified PI3K signaling , with potential to amplify RAS , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and TORC2 itself [ - ] .	6	117	51	None
