A combined survival analysis ( I-CAMP ) of seven prospective Japanese trials of 148 patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations who received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> demonstrated a response rate of 76.4 % , median PFS of 9.7 months and overall survival of 24.3 months [ ] .	67	63	19	sensitivity

There is evidence supporting a different sensitivity of NSCLCs to the TKI <ANNO_TYPE_drug> depending on the presence of an exon 21 mutation or an exon 19 deletion , having deletions at exon 19 been associated with a better response .	71	49	8	sensitivity

The mechanistic reasons behind the resistance to EGFR TKI are different , probably involving <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation and MET amplification .

<ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations were analysed in 10 of 27 patients by direct sequencing of paraffin embedded tumour samples extracted before initiation of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> therapy . The EGFR mutations were detected in 4 of 10 patients . In-frame deletions within exon 19 were detected in three patients , and a mutation of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was detected within exon 21 in one patient .	21	0	50	sensitivity
Preclinical data suggest that amplification of the MET proto-oncogene may play a role in acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKIs through the PI3K pathway . MET amplification has been detected in lung cancer cell lines that have acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Current evidence implies that MET amplification occurs independently of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and it has been proposed that concurrent inhibition of both may further improve clinical outcomes .	39	17	50	resistance or non-response
In addition , because HGF overexpression was frequently observed in tumors with the gatekeeper <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation [ ] , monotherapy with a mutant-selective <ANNO_TYPE_gene> may not be sufficient to inhibit the growth of tumors with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	38	23	14	resistance or non-response

It is important to note that the most predominant somatic mutations that were included in these trials were EGFR exon 19 deletions ( the most common is delE746_A750 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ; therefore , all current genomic based approvals for EGFR TKIs are limited to tumors with the aforementioned classic mutations .	5	0	64	sensitivity

In vitro studies demonstrated that the effective concentration of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in tumour cells harbouring both the L858R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations has to be 300 times higher to induce apoptosis than in cells only with an activating mutation in codon 858 [ , ] .

Unfortunately , more than half of patients with MET gene amplification also presented the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the EGFR gene . Despite the lack of unequivocal efficacy , simultaneous inhibition of c-MET and EGFR function seems to be an attractive alternative therapeutic option in resistance to reversible EGFR TKI . There are ongoing second and third phase trials of the c-MET inhibitors tivantinib and PF-2341066 , used together with erlotinib in patients previously untreated with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI or in case of progression after successful monotherapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , – ] .	86	75	14	resistance or non-response
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation leads to a substitution of threonine to methionine in the catalytic centre of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase , which is located in the binding pocket of TKI and ATP . Substitution of threonine at codon 790 into larger methionine probably results in blocking of the binding sites of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib aromatic residues with their point of action .	50	16	1	resistance or non-response

Presence of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution may be an indication for treatment with irreversible EGFR TKI , such as neratinib , keratinib and especially afatinib , which is currently in the third phase of clinical trials . The LUX-Lung 1 study has shown that afatinib induces an objective response and prolongation of progression-free survival ( PFS ) in NSCLC patients who have been previously treated with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI for at least 12 weeks . The rationale for this type of study is the fact that afatinib has a different molecular structure when compared to gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	94	64	2	resistance or non-response

Appearance of the most frequent activating mutation – deletion of 15 nucleotides in codons 746-750 in exon 19 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution in exon 21 of the EGFR gene – is associated with permanent stimulation of the receptor , but they also lead to an increase in both efficiency of reversible EGFR TKI and effectiveness of radiotherapy . Activating mutations of the EGFR gene have been reported in only about 10 % of Caucasians patients with NSCLC , more often in non-smokers , women , and patients with adenocarcinoma . Therefore , the first studies on the efficacy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and gefitinib in second-line treatment ( BR.21 , ISEL , INTEREST ) have shown that an objective response to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI treatment occurs in less than 10 % of patients in the general population [ – ] .	99	119	19 20	sensitivity

It is possible to conceive that an increase in the clinical doses of gefitinib or switching to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which is given at its maximal tolerated dose [ ] , may lead to beneficial clinical effects , possibly by increasing BIM expression , in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations who acquired L747S after exposure to gefitinib .

We used an integrative approach to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of a tumor , which are determined by the composition of , and interactions between , sensitive and resistant cells in the presence of treatment . Although several mechanisms of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKIs ( e.g. , MET amplification ) have been identified , we focused on addressing the penetrance of preexisting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> harboring resistant cells in NSCLC since this mechanism of resistance remains a major clinical problem .	22	78	98	resistance or non-response
Our biological model of sensitive and resistant cells consisted of two NSCLC cell lines , HCC827 and H1975 , with different sensitivities to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ) The HCC827 cell line harbors a mutation in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain ( E746–A750 ) that renders these cells sensitive to EGFR TKI therapies , whereas the H1975 cells harbor both the L858R <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations and are resistant to EGFR TKIs .	26	24	63 64	resistance or non-response

Somatic mutations included two different <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations : an activating mutation in a dominant tumor clone as well as a second <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation present in an <ANNO_TYPE_drug> subclone .	26	5	21	resistance or non-response
The mechanistic reasons behind the resistance to EGFR TKI are different , probably involving <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation and MET amplification . Recently , some irreversible <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and MET inhibitors have shown antitumour activity in patients resistant to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in pre-clinical studies ( ; ; ; ; ) .	39	25	14	resistance or non-response
Deletion in exon 19 , which removes the conserved sequence LREA , and a single point mutation in exon 21 , which leads to the substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , are the most clinically relevant and extensively studied drug-sensitive mutations [ ] . Studies have shown that these mutations preferentially bind to first generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] .	65	61	34	sensitivity
In this study , we report that BMS-690514 has in vivo efficacy on a panel of NSLCC xenografts , including those with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations , conferring resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> therapies such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or Gefitinib .	32	28	22	resistance or non-response
A similar phenomenon has recently been described for the acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancers . Sensitive detection methods have identified a proportion of tyrosin- kinase- naive tumors that carry <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , a resistant tumor cell clones that may be selected during the exposure to gefitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	55	12 13 14 15	38	resistance or non-response
Moreover , interactions between <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and MYO2 or MYH9 have been described , and a MYH9 inhibitor synergizes with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors to induce apoptosis in cells carrying the drug-resistant mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	4	19	30	resistance or non-response
The combination of a TKI and a mAb was explored as a potential strategy to overcome acquired resistance to first-generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . Kim and colleagues demonstrated that the combination of lapatinib with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> overcame gefitinib resistance due to the secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in NSCLC by inducing enhanced cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo [ ] .	32	20	40	response 
Furthermore , we found that dimerization dependent L858R mutant shows a dramatic response to cetuximab , whereas tumors driven by dimerization independent mutants such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> are resistant to the antibody , suggesting that there is a close correlation between dimerization dependency of lung cancer derived oncogenic mutant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and pharmacological effects of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	53	48	25	response

The absence of both KRAS and BRAF mutations are common features seen in colorectal cancers that are responsive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] , thus making the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation in this case of particular interest . The somatic <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in EGFR occurs at the final glycine of the GxGxxG nucleotide binding motif that is essential for ATP binding and is conserved among all protein kinases ( Figure	19	27	38	sensitivity

In our retrospective study , 26.7 % of patients , all with KRAS wild-type tumours , who had previously unresectable liver-only metastases , underwent surgical resection after systemic therapy , with R0 resection achieved in 38 patients ( 21.6 % ) ; one of those was patient with the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Although it is difficult to make any comparison , because our patients were not selected according to specific systemic therapy , these results are comparable with those reported in previous studies claiming that 19 to 23 % patients treated with bevacizumab- and irinotecan based chemotherapy and with previously unresectable liver-only metastases underwent resection.– In a recently published clinical study BOXER , where the patients with unresectable liver-only metastases were treated with oxaliplatin <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and bevacizumab , R0 resection was achieved in 40 % of patients .	125 126	49	50	sensitivity
Resistance against <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is an emerging problem in the treatment of CML. Dose-adjustments , new <ANNO_TYPE_gene> targeting drugs , and other antileukemic approaches may be sufficient to overcome resistance in many cases . A specific challenge remains the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant of BCR/ABL that is resistant against most available TK inhibitors .	2	15	38	None
Taking their in vitro activity into consideration , the following rank order of ( oncogenic ) potency is found : Y253F = <ANNO_TYPE_variant> & gt ; wt BCR-ABL & gt ; T315I & gt ; H396P &gt ; M351T & gt ; others . These mutations should not count in the evaluation of drug resistance and the consecutive treatment plan in the same way as clinically relevant ( oncogenic ) mutations . A number of different strategies have been proposed to treat patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistant CML , in whom <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations are detected .	84	90	22	None
In non-clinical models they are 30 to 300 times more potent than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and can inhibit most Imatinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations ( EPARs for Imatinib , Dasatinib , and Nilotinib [ ] ) . Comparable with the experience in anti-infective drugs , multidrug-resistant BCR/ABL mutations occur which preclude further use of the approved TKI . For example , patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation respond only on treatment with third generation TKI Ponatinib , which was specifically designed as a treatment option for these populations .	12	18	59	None
Survival for CML-CP patients with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> point mutation treated with TKIs is estimated to be reduced by 50 % compared with patients without the T315I mutation ( median survival of 22 months vs. more than 10 years for TKI-responsive CML patients ; Nicolini et al. , 2009 ) . Additionally , omacetaxine has been shown to potentiate the effects of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and nilotinib by overcoming cytokine rescue of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> leukemic cells thought to be mediated primarily by interleukin-3 ( Allan , Holyoake , Craig , & amp ; Jorgensen , 2011 ; Klag et al. , 2012 ) , offering promising new options for combination therapies .	61	69	6	None
We first investigated the effect of these ITKs on the viability of murine Ba/F3 cells , carrying wild type ( WT ) BCR-ABL , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or G250E-BCR-ABL mutation . As shown in Figure , BaF3 cells expressing native <ANNO_TYPE_gene> were highly sensitive to imatinib , dasatinib and ponatinib , whereas BaF3-T315I-BCR-ABL and BaF3-G250E-BCR-ABL cells were resistant to both <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and dasatinib .	58	38	24	None
The level of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> transcription gradually decreased from baseline , with a 1-log reduction at 6 months and a 2-log reduction at 12 months . Our findings are consistent with these observations and suggest that nilotinib is highly active in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or -intolerant CML-CP/AP . We detected 5 BCR-ABL mutations ( M244V , F317L , N358D , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and E459K ) in 6 patients at baseline screening .	42	3	59	None
Constitutive activation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase via the PI3K and AKT signalling network results in activation of substrates , such as the ribosomal subunit S6 kinase ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and eukaryotic initation factor 4E , which are critical for synthesis of proteins involved in cellular growth and survival . Activation of the AKT pathway can occur through homozygous loss of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene , but there is no definite prognostic significance for PTEN loss in mRCC [ , ] , and there does not appear to be a correlation between tumour PTEN expression and benefit from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	98	4	27	None

This is due to point mutations in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain , including the most frequent T315I and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations [ , ,, ] . Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors , such as nilotinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and bosutinib are capable of targeting the majority of imatinib-resistant mutations , but none of them are effective against leukemia cells harboring the T315I mutation [ - ] .	34	8	18	None
BCR-ABL1 mutations were detected in 160 of 363 patients ( 44 % ) , with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T315I mutants being the most frequently found .

The L747S mutation lies at the start of the β3 strand and the α-C-helix [ ] and has analogous residues in BCR-ABL ( L237M ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or P ) that have been identified in TKI resistant disease [ ] . The occurrence of these secondary mutations spurred development of second and third generation irreversible TKIs which bind covalently to the cysteinyl-797 residue in the pocket of the EGFR-kinase domain and overcome resistance driven by the T790M mutation [ ] .

In various biological assays , P-loop mutants Y253F and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> exhibited an increased transformation potency relative to unmutated BCR-ABL. Overall , the relative transformation potencies of various mutations were found to be as follows : Y253F & gt ; E255K & gt ; native BCR-ABL ≥ T315I & gt ; H396P &gt ; M351T . Transformation potency also correlated with intrinsic <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase activity in this study . Two agents are currently approved for second-line treatment of patients with CML who demonstrate resistance ( or intolerance ) to imatinib : <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and nilotinib [ , ] .	90	61	9	None
Remarkably , similar responses were observed across all BCR-ABL mutations when compared with wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , with the exception of the highly resistant T315I mutation . Patients with the bosutinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation were not included in the study . Bosutinib after failure of second/third-line therapy with dasatinib and/or <ANNO_TYPE_drug>	48	14	30	None
A complete hematological response and a major cytogenetic response were observed broadly across the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants , including individuals harboring the dasatinib-resistant F317L , the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> Y253H , and F359C/I/V mutations , but not T315I . Nine individuals developed new mutations in the course of bosutinib treatment ( V299L , n = 4 ; L248V , n = 2 ; T315I , n = 2 ; F359C , n = 1 ; <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , n = 1 ) and eight of these individuals discontinued bosutinib because of progressive disease or unsatisfactory response .	25	14	72	None
In vivo experiments with CML xenografts in mice demonstrated that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment , compared with treatment with vehicle , improved survival of mice infused with either wild type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> or the imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutant ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( ; ) .	10	28	35	None

More recently , in addition to other second-site mutations associated with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D761Y in exon 19 or T854A in exon 21 ) , novel EGFR independent mechanisms have been discovered that contribute to EGFR TKI resistance either in the absence or presence of the EGFR T790M mutation reviewed in . The second well-known mechanism of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance is the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) gene amplification .	64	68	19	None
Intense research efforts over the past few years have identified two major mechanisms of acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> : secondary resistance mutations ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and “oncogene kinase switch” systems ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification and AXL activation ) .	17	35	25	None
Using the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> EGFR mutant NSCLC cell line HCC4006 harboring the delL747-E749 , A750P mutation in EGFR exon 19 , Suda et al. established that mesenchymal status , not a specific oncogenic activated protein , could sufficiently promote loss of EGFR dependence to confer resistance to erlotinib . More recently , Chang et al. confirmed that in the absence of the common second-site EGFR mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplification , acquired resistance to gefitinib occurs in EGFR mutated PC9 cells that have undergone EMT .	2	67	65	None

Although the resistant cell line HCG827GR does not have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , it was found to have MET amplification . MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is associated with the development of various human cancers . Therefore , EGFR-TKIs fail to inhibit the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway dependent growth signal because the constitutive phosphorylation of HER3 by MET occurs independent of EGFR activation , which causes the cells to acquire resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	53	11	None
This findings show that EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is a common resistance mechanism to both reversible , and when amplified , the irreversible EGFR inhibitors . In our case , the response duration of irreversible EGFR inhibitor was 11 months which was unusually longer than those of initial <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( for 4 months ) and second round gefitinib ( for 6 months ) treatments . Recently an alternative approach is to develop novel strategies , instead of irreversible EGFR inhibitors , to inhibit EGFR and/or EGFR signaling , including the use of inhibitors of HSP90 and/or EGFR downstream signaling ( such as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and MEK inhibitors ) as these resistant cancers still remain dependent on EGFR signaling for their growth .	46	100 101	5	None
We first compared BT474 and SKBR3 cells ( without endogenous hotspot mutations ) infected with wild-type , E545K or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> p110α retroviral constructs .

The dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR might be advantageous over single inhibition by suppressing a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> feedback loop that leads to the pathway reactivation . Based on this idea , an on-going phase I study of the PI3K and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> dual inhibitor , BEZ235 , was designed for the patients with advanced solid tumors harboring PIK3CA or PTEN alteration ( NCT01195376 ) . In this study , we showed that the survival of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> SCLC cell lines was well suppressed by BEZ235 , accompanied by the suppression of S6RP phosphorylation .	75	40	16	None
None of the cell lines showed apparent cytotoxicity in response to doses up to 1 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Conversely , all <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors significantly impaired the proliferation of the SCLC cell lines . H1048 , which harbors a PIK3CA mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , was the most sensitive to all of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors , with IC50 values of 3.8 , 5.4 , 99.9 , and 195.4 nM for INK128 , BEZ235 , MK2206 , and BKM120 , respectively .	15 16	21	41	None

Indeed , this has already been documented for a patient with NSCLC who relapsed after the appearance of C1156Y and L1196M mutations in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] . L1196M represents a mutation of the “gatekeeper” residue , similar to the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mutations observed in EGFR , and T315I mutations in ABL . Mutations in the gatekeeper site are thought to increase the affinity for ATP significantly , outcompeting the effects of ATP competitive inhibitors [ ] . The effect of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is unclear , although it may have an indirect effect on crizotinib binding , and further studies will be required to establish its mechanism .	39 40	23	81	None

This drug was designed as a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL oncogene <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , known to be responsible for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) cells [ ] . The therapeutic effectiveness of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and relative absence of detrimental side-effects has made it a model for the development of an array of new therapeutic agents targeted to inhibit signal transduction enzymes , especially protein kinases .

RNA ( siRNA ) -mediated depletion of NRAS in two melanoma cell lines ( 224 and BL , which harbor a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> NRAS mutation ) inhibits proliferation and renders cells more sensitive to chemotherapy ( Eskandarpour et al. , ) .

On the contrary , the mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 2 has been associated with better response to EGFR antibodies than other KRAS mutations , but the data are mixed. , In addition to the exon 2 KRAS mutation , other mutations such as KRAS mutation exons 3–4 and NRAS mutation exons 2–4 have also emerged to be clinically relevant biomarkers of a lack of response to EGFR antibodies . For example , treating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> tumor patients with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> may even have a detrimental effect on survival as shown in the Panitumumab Randomized Trial in Combination With Chemotherapy for Metastatic CRC to Determine Efficacy ( PRIME ) study , where patients were randomized to first-line chemotherapy with or without panitumumab .	77	73	6	None
The cause of refractoriness has been identified in ca. 15 % of mCRC patients as mutations in the BRAF gene , primarily <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution . Raf family proteins are downstream of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> proteins in the signal transduction pathway originating at EGFR . It comes as no surprise , then , that activating mutations in the BRAF gene occurring in cancer cells have a similar clinical effect to KRAS gene mutations , making them refractory both to cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , , – ] .	78	31	22	None
Since no significant changes in growth inhibition with concurrent inhibitors treatment were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells ( ) , drug effects on the activity of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and PI3K signaling pathways were assessed in the remaining three cell lines : MCF-7 , T47D and SKBr3 ( ) . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 1 nM ) with or without trametinib was observed to up-regulate p-AKT and markedly reduce p-rpS6 in MCF-7 and SKBr3 cells ( ) , and reduce p-p70S6K in MCF-7 cells ( ) . For NVP-BEZ235 , increased p-AKT was observed in SKBr3 cells alone or in combination with trametinib , while GSK2126458 , with or without trametinib , reduced p-AKT in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and SKBr3 cell lines .	47	25	111	None
An NRAS Q61K mutation was also identified in an isolated nodal metastasis from a patient with BRAF mutant melanoma , which progressed after an initial response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Interestingly , a distinct NRAS mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) was identified in a second progression site in the same patient . In resistant cells in vitro , both <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and P-ERK levels were maintained despite the presence of BRAF inhibitor .	27	57	36	None
In addition , mutations such as S601P [ ] , L629P [ ] were reported to be associated with primary resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> positive patient . In the present study , we reported that S116836 synthesized in our lab is a novel multiple TKI , and showing strikingly inhibitory effect on the activity of gate-keeper mutant T315I BCR-ABL and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> PDGFRα at low nanomolar concentrations .	22	24	61	None

At present , the Genius study ( NCT01579630 ) is ongoing to compare the efficacy and safety of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> versus pemetrexed alone as maintenance therapy in patients EGFR mutation negative or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> single mutation who responded to pemetrexed/platinum as first-line therapy .	68	3	81	None
Consequently , standard GIST therapies ( ie , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and sunitinib ) are less efficacious in this clinical group . Although the pathogenesis is largely unknown , recent studies have uncovered germline mutations involving succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) , most commonly in the subunit genes SDHB and SDHC , resulting in a complete loss or reduction in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> protein. , Loss of SDH protein expression is effectively demonstrated using traditional immunohistochemistry. , , The clinical features associated with the presence of SDH germline mutations in wild-type GISTs , which accounted for 12 % of wild-type GISTs in one study , has not been defined . In adult wild-type-GISTs , BRAF exon 15 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations have been detected in 7 % –13 % of GISTs , commonly located in the small bowel. ,	8	56	111	None
The dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR might be advantageous over single inhibition by suppressing a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> feedback loop that leads to the pathway reactivation . Based on this idea , an on-going phase I study of the PI3K and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> dual inhibitor , BEZ235 , was designed for the patients with advanced solid tumors harboring PIK3CA or PTEN alteration ( NCT01195376 ) . In this study , we showed that the survival of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> SCLC cell lines was well suppressed by BEZ235 , accompanied by the suppression of S6RP phosphorylation .	75	40	16	None
Dual p97/proteasome inhibition substantially decreased levels of phosphorylated and total <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in all MMCs lines , whereas treatment with only bortezomib or Eer1 resulted in a reduction in the levels of phosphorylated and total S6P in two of the four MMC lines in each case ( U-266 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ; OPM-2 and KMS-11 for Eer1 ) .	50	48	10	None

A complete hematological response and a major cytogenetic response were observed broadly across the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutants , including individuals harboring the dasatinib-resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , the nilotinib-resistant Y253H , and F359C/I/V mutations , but not T315I . Nine individuals developed new mutations in the course of bosutinib treatment ( V299L , n = 4 ; L248V , n = 2 ; T315I , n = 2 ; F359C , n = 1 ; G250E , n = 1 ) and eight of these individuals discontinued <ANNO_TYPE_drug> because of progressive disease or unsatisfactory response .	84	14	22	None
( B ) <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells were cultured with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 10 nM ) or control media for 12 h. Cells were subjected to immunostaining using <ANNO_TYPE_gene> NF-κB ( green ) and DAPI ( blue ) followed by confocal microscopic analysis .	8	25	3	None
Rarer mutations include c.1798_1799delinsAG p.Val600Arg ( V600R ) , c.1801A &gt ; G p.Lys601Glu ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and c.1799_1800delinsAA p.Val600Glu ( V600E2 ) . BRAF mutation results in hyperactivation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signalling pathway , causing deregulation of cell proliferation and oncogenesis without the requirement for Ras activation . Braf is the most potent of the Raf proteins to activate the downstream signalling cascade , hence mutant Braf was identified as a novel target for kinase inhibitors such as vemurafenib ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) and dabrafenib .	81	31	15	None
Importantly , expression of kinase dead ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , phospho-mimetic S338D or WT CRAF rescued this mitotic defect , whereas a non-phosphorylatable ( S338A ) CRAF mutant , failed to do so ( and ) , even though this mutant maintains kinase activity and can dimerize with BRAF ( data not shown ) . Moreover , in cells treated with the microtubule stabilizing agent paclitaxel , CRAF remained localized to the mitotic spindle suggesting that KG5 and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> arrest cells at pro-metaphase via distinct mechanisms ( ) . Previous studies have revealed that CRAF and BRAF can form heterodimers and that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> can play a role in mitosis– .	78	102	7	None
It was initially proposed that the T790M mutation might prevent the proper binding of tyrosine kinase inhibitors via steric hindrance , similar to the corresponding gatekeeper mutations in BCR-ABL ( T315I ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) that confer resistance to imatinib ( Gleevec ) in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors . Interestingly , it was discovered that the T790M mutation does not confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib by preventing their binding as originally thought .	71	33	35	None
In a phase III open-label clinical trial ( METRIC ) [ ] trametinib was shown to significantly improve rates of progression-free and overall survival compared with chemotherapy with dacarbazine or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 6 month overall survival of 81 % and 67 % respectively , patient crossover included , p = 0.01 ) , in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or V600K BRAF mutation positive metastatic melanoma .

The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , on the other hand , was inhibited during the entire observation period and was not affected by activated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . When <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells were exposed to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , the cell numbers exhibited a greater increase than that of the unexposed cells after 12 and 24 h of incubation .	31	23	26	None
In addition , there was no difference in PFS for EGFR TKI therapy according to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> genotypes ( P = 0.73 ) .

Contrary to the preclinical data reporting that tumors with KRAS mutations , at least the specific genotype such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , would be more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , , patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations showed inferior treatment outcomes to the pemetrexed based regimen compared with those with KRAS wild types , irrespective of KRAS genotypes .	26	31	19	None
Recently , genome-wide screening for the genetic determinants of gout found that an SNP of ABCG2/BCRP ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is associated with high uric acid levels , and demonstrated that uric acid is a natural substrate of ABCG2/BCRP. , ABCG2/BCRP also appears to play a protective role against xenobiotics and their metabolites. , The typical ABCG2/BCRP substrates , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and SN-38 , are detoxified by glucuronidation with uridine-diphosphate–glucuronyltransferase , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> can extrude SN-38–glucuronide .	58	70	17	None
Although irreversible inhibitors of the EGFR such as dacomitinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibit <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in vitro their clinical activity in the setting of tumors with T790M mutations remains to be demonstrated and novel mutation specific T790M inhibitors are in clinical development . A second mechanism for resistance which is seen in 5–20 % of patients is amplification of CMET which causes resistance to EGFR TKIs by activating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Kinase signaling through ERBB3 [ , ,, ] .	10	66	12	None
This is in keeping with an earlier study by Di Nicolantonio and colleagues [ ] , where the response to panitumumab or cetuximab was found to be impeded by the presence of BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and restored ( in a cellular model of CRC cells ) by BRAF inhibitor sorafenib [ ] . They suggested that this experimental observation should encourage conceiving clinical trials using multiple therapies with EGFR and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors , considering that cetuximab , panitumumab , and sorafenib are already approved for clinical use . Standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy , using <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or oxaliplatin did not seem to be affected by KRAS/BRAF mutations [ ] .	93	70	33	None
Kim et al. [ ] showed instead that the SLC22A1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism ( rs683369 ) , which leads to Leu160Phe replacement , is associated with IM response in CML. Patients with the 480GG genotype showed a higher risk of treatment failure or loss of response than other genotypes . Finally , Takahashi et al. [ ] showed that the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> A1222G polymorphism ( rs628031 ) , which leads to Met408Val replacement , is associated with molecular response in the group of patients treated with IM doses lower than 400 mg. Patients with the 1222GG genotype showed a higher MMR rate . Uptake of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has also been described , in vitro , to be mediated to a modest extent by SLCO1B3 , which encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 [ ] , but Takahashi et al. [ ] did not find any association with IM response ( Table ) .	103	59	10	None

Mutations of three residues near the mouth of the myristate binding site ( C464Y , P465S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) were reported to cause resistance to the binding of GNF-2 , presumably for steric reasons . The myristate-binding-site mutant , E505K , was inhibited by Imatinib and Nilotinib , but not by GNF-2 , arguing that GNF-2 targets the myristoyl pocket [ ] . In this report we showed that GNF-2 cooperated with the Abl kinase inhibitors (AKIs) , Imatinib , Nilotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , in inhibiting clonigenicity of Bcr-Abl T315I transformed <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells .	82	91	17	None

SSCP analysis indicated KRAS WT status , which qualified her ( the patient ) for concomitant targeted therapy ( cetuximab : first dose , 400 mg/m2 ; subsequent doses , 250 mg/m2 ) and chemotherapy ( 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 bolus and then 600 mg/m2 over 22 h for day 1 ; <ANNO_TYPE_drug> 200 mg/m2 before 5-fluorouracil ) . After 4 months of treatment , stabilization of the metastatic lesions within the pelvis was observed , but two new metastatic lesions within the skin layers had occurred . Fine needle aspiration of the new metastatic lesions indicated adenocarcinomas , which were tested for KRAS and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation using the real-time PCR method ( KRBR-RT50 , Entrogen ) .	51	105	104	None

Several studies have reported renal failure and tumor lysis syndrome during TKI based molecular targeted therapies , including with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma , with imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia , and with flavopiridol for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.– Because <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant of ABCG2/BCRP corresponding to SNP 421C&gt ; A reduces uric acid transport and those TKIs are substrates/inhibitors of ABCG2/BCRP , TKI therapy in patients with the SNP 421C&gt ; A ( Q141K ) may be at higher risk of tumor lysis syndrome . A defect in the pharmacological interaction has been suggested between sunitinib and another ABCG2/BCRP germ-line mutant allele , 1291T & gt ; C. Remarkably , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> reversed wild-type ABCG2/BCRP mediated drug resistance and competitively inhibited ABCG2/BCRP mediated estrone 3-sulfate transport and the binding of 125I-iodoarylazidoprazosin to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	110	131	39 40	None

Resveratrol , a naturally occurring substance found in grapes , has been shown to modulate <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in BCR-ABL transformed cells and to exhibit antileukemic effects [ - ] . Treatment of either imatinib mesylate-sensitive or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mesylate-resistant CML cells with resveratrol resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death [ ] .

Based on our data , we hypothesized that PRR of hnRNP L binds to PTB and cooperatively suppresses inclusion of exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . We thus examined the role of PRR of hnRNP L on the interaction with PTB . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> tagged hnRNP L ( His-L ) , its PRR deleted variant ( His-L-ΔPRR ) , histidine tagged hnRNP LL ( His-LL ) , and its PRR inserted variant ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) were expressed in SH-SY5Y cells , and they were immunoprecipitated with anti-histidine antibody in the presence of RNase .	39	69	21	None
Additionally , AP26113 was evaluated on the crizotinib resistant gatekeeper mutant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> both in vitro and in vivo and appeared to be able to overcome resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Ki determination demonstrated a very similar biochemical potency on wild-type ALK and the L1196M ALK mutant ( 0.09 and 0.08 nM respectively ) , with both cellular and in vivo data ( using engineered <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells ) indicating that growth of ALK–L1196M mutant driven-cells is inhibited at similar , albeit slightly higher , doses which inhibit cells harboring wild-type ALK ( Katayama et al. , ) .	27	63	11	None

However , acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs is inevitable due to various mechanisms , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , c-Met amplification , activation of alternative pathways ( IGF-1 , HGF , PI3CA , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] ) , transformation to mesenchymal cells [ ] or small cell features [ ] , and tumor heterogeneity [ ] . A randomized trial comparing the irreversible ErbB-family blocker <ANNO_TYPE_drug> versus placebo in patients with NSCLC after prior EGFR-TKI exposure failed to prove a benefit of overall survival [ ] .	63	31	15	None
Another approach for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated resistance is the dual inhibition of EGFR with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and cetuximab , an EGFR blocking antibody resembling the synergistic combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab in ErbB2 positive breast cancer . Due to promising preliminary results of activity and tolerability , final results of this regimen are being eagerly anticipated [ ] . In selected patients with acquisition of resistance by activated compensatory pathways such as MET and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , addition of a MET [ ] or AXL [ ] inhibitor to EGFR-TKIs could be beneficial .	13	72	3	None
Acquired resistance EGFR mutations Mutations in the EC domain ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and in the kinase domain ( codons 714 and 794 ) of EGFR found in patients <ANNO_TYPE_drug> remained active in a patient with S492R mutation , which abrogated cetuximab binding . RAS/BRAF activation CRC cell lines with acquired KRAS/BRAF point mutations and/or KRAS amplification and one patient derived xenograft Combination of cetuximab with pimasertib ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor ) induced moderate tumor shrinkage in vivo .	28	67	10	None
Cyclin D1 , in association with cyclin dependent kinase-4 and -6 , induces the cell to enter the S phase by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressing protein , which binds to transcription factors , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .

The ability of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress response signalling could , in part , explain how low doses of genistein induce <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene expression .

The two main neurotransmitters eliciting contraction in human and rodent urinary bladder are adenosine triphosphate and acetylcholine , which act on a ligand gated ion channel ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor ) and two G-protein coupled receptors ( M2 and M3 muscarinic ) , respectively ( de Groat and Yoshimura ) . A common approach for studying how the functions of these receptors change in diabetes mellitus is to examine their contractile roles in isolated urinary bladder from animals treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> (STZ) . In smooth muscle , cAMP mediates relaxation , and activation of the M2 receptor inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and the relaxation elicited by forskolin and activation of β-adrenoceptors in gastrointestinal and urinary bladder smooth muscle ( Ehlert ) .	79	97 98	27	None

Alcohol sensitivity phenotypes of single point mutations in unc-18 We recently demonstrated that a single point mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) in Munc18 acts biochemically by reducing binding to the assembled SNARE complex and that the orthologous mutation in C. elegans unc-18 ( D214N ) reduces sensitivity to both low and high concentrations of exogenous <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .

Based on our data , we hypothesized that PRR of hnRNP L binds to PTB and cooperatively suppresses inclusion of exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .

To our knowledge , no NSCLC patient who initially responded to but then progressed on either gefitinib or erlotinib has yet been treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .

Moreover , whether <ANNO_TYPE_gene> siRNAs could potentiate the efficacy of TKIs in imatinib-resistant cells is worthy of further investigation . One study has shown a synergistic effect between AMN107 and arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) or Bcr-Abl-siRNA in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> imatinib-resistant cells or those with an H396P abl mutation , indicating that the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and ATO or siRNA may represent a new strategy for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML patients [ , ] .	55	3	39	None
To further identify <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation as downstream effector of VEGFR2 signal in Klotho mediated anoikis resistance , functional alterations were analyzed after PAK1 activation with constitutive active mutant PAK1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cotransfection in the presence of VEGFR2 inhibition with VEGR2 inhibitor <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or its blocking antibody treatment in Klotho overexpressed hepatoma cells .	40	3	29	None

Multikinase small molecule inhibitors such as sorafenib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> can be used per recent NCCN guidelines ( Version 2.2013 ) , but prospective clinical trials have not yet demonstrated a distinct molecular subgroup of PTC patients that derives large benefit from such targeted therapies [ ] .

Several studies have reported renal failure and tumor lysis syndrome during TKI based molecular targeted therapies , including with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma , with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for chronic myelogenous leukemia , and with flavopiridol for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.– Because <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant of ABCG2/BCRP corresponding to SNP 421C&gt ; A reduces uric acid transport and those TKIs are substrates/inhibitors of ABCG2/BCRP , TKI therapy in patients with the SNP <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ; A ( Q141K ) may be at higher risk of tumor lysis syndrome .	25	69	39 40	None
Although the resistant cell line <ANNO_TYPE_gene> does not have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , it was found to have MET amplification . MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is associated with the development of various human cancers . Therefore , EGFR-TKIs fail to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway dependent growth signal because the constitutive phosphorylation of HER3 by MET occurs independent of EGFR activation , which causes the cells to acquire resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	5	11	None

MDR1 is a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> that acts as an energy dependent drug efflux pump for chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used against hematologic malignancies [ ] .

In a previous study of the effect of the MDR1 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in myeloma patients treated with dexamethasone , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and vincristine ( DAV ) , followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) , this SNP was predictive of the overall survival ( OS ) , but did not modify the response to treatment [ ] .	69	3 4	55	None
The combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( dual c-MET/anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK ] inhibitor ) ( ) and dacomitinib , although in early phase , is particularly interesting since one of its components , dacomitinib , was designed to address the acquired resistance by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation in EGFR . This combination could potentially be effective in patients with acquired resistance via T790M and/or MET amplification . Another potential strategy to overcome acquired resistance is the use of combination therapies including <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors .	3	80	43	None

A similar clinical benefit is observed in patients with lung cancers harboring the two most common EGFR activating mutations , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and exon 19 deletions [ – , ] . The striking initial response to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors is thought to stem from the phenomenon of “oncogene addiction” [ ] , and a common signaling cascade may be involved in the apoptosis induced by multiple TKIs [ ] . Rapid inactivation of phosphorylated ERK , AKT , and STAT3/5 , and the delayed accumulation of phosphorylated p38 are commonly observed in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , BCR-ABL- , and EGFR dependent cells after exposure to the specific inhibitors SU6655 , imatinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , respectively [ ] .	112	93	20	None
Transplantation of a TASK-2-type sensor in the background of the pHo-insensitive TASK-3-H98N channel was done by mutating residue V221 to H. <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was chosen , rather than the much more basic arginine present in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , because it should allow us to work at less extreme pH values given that TASK-3 lacks the hydrophobic environment thought to lower the pKa of the sensing arginine of TASK-2 . Although TASK-3-H98N-V221H double mutant could be readily expressed in HEK-293 cells , it had low currents and poor selectivity towards K+ over Na+ when assayed at 5 mM extracellular K+ . Loss of selectivity has been associated with gate closure occurring at the outer part of the pore in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> channels and is thought to occur by what has been termed collapse of the selectivity filter .	21	34	116	None
Again , the activity of this resistance mechanism could be suppressed through combined MET and BRAF or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibition . Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and Wnt pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following imatinib .	73	17	143	None

The fact that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or K substitutions do not reduce IN enzymatic activity , but slightly affect RT and interaction with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , points to a change in PIC processing due to a modified trend of interactions between IN monomers , between IN and RT , or between IN and a cellular factor such as p75/LEDGF . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is a versatile amino acid that can assume positive charge , but remains usually neutral at physiological pH .	57	21	3	None

This flux increase is apparent from the increased extracellular yields of α-ketoglutarate and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> at unchanged biomass yields . Of the three individually tested Pfk2 sites S163 , S167 and S171 , only the Pfk2 [ S163A ] mutant exhibited a growth phenotype on gluconeogenic carbon sources , namely a 20 % lower biomass yield on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than the reference strain ( ; ) .

In the HOXA1 gene , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant causing a histidine to arginine has been shown to disrupt the string of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> repeats , which was believed to be the binding site of other proteins .

In addition , PGRMC1 has been shown to bind other CYP enzymes ( CYP3A4 , CYP21A2 , CYP7A1 , CYP2C2 and CYP2C8 ) , , with the activities of CYP2C2 and drug metabolizing P450 cytochromes ( CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 ) being modestly affected in human embryonic kidney ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) and HepG2 liver cells . Furthermore , the heme binding defective mutant , PGRMC1 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , reduced the survival of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and camptothecin , implicating the heme binding capacity of PGRMC1 in regulating susceptibility towards chemotherapeutic agents .	77	48	65	None
While in healthy tissues , BRCA proteins may compensate for the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibition of single stranded DNA break repair , such buffering is lost in BRCA mutated tumors . Other examples of addiction dependent on tumor suppressor genes are the loss of PTEN and pRB , which lead to the stimulation of PI3K/mTOR ( Neshat et al. , ) and E2F ( Sellers and Kaelin , ) , respectively . Those defects consequently render tumor cells particularly sensitive to mTOR inhibitors and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( which inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_variant> activated topoisomerase II ) .	82	11	86	None
Residue D167 of IN was mutated in this study because it is well conserved in HIV and it is embedded within a short stretch of amino acids ( 161–173 ) with nuclear localization signal properties and important for IN–p75/LEDGF interaction. , , We initially <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to replace a polar acid residue by a polar basic/neutral one with the purpose to induce a mild phenotype with an integration rate between WT <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> vectors . Integrase mutations D167A and D167K induced opposite effect on single round infectivity of HIV with D167A increasing it to 140 % while D167K reduced it to 5 % of WT indicating a critical role played by this residue in the processing of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	44 45	118	71 72	None
The fact that D167A or K substitutions do not reduce IN enzymatic activity , but slightly affect RT and interaction with p75/LEDGF , points to a change in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> processing due to a modified trend of interactions between IN monomers , between IN and RT , or between IN and a cellular factor such as p75/LEDGF . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is a versatile amino acid that can assume positive charge , but remains usually neutral at physiological pH . In fact , this mutation affects later time points of our analysis with vector <ANNO_TYPE_variant> still integrating between 48 and 72 hours following transduction .	57	28	91	None

Overexpression of wild type EGFR induced high and sustained phosphorylation of EGFR , Shc , MEK ( mitogen activated protein kinase kinase ) and ERK ( extracellular signal regulated kinase ) , while the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation reduced these response levels . In addition , H1299L858R , which is supposed to be more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than H1299EGFR-WT , was effectively inhibited by gefitinib administration at the downstream part of the signaling pathway ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and ERK ) compared with H1299EGFR-WT , but , surprisingly , not at the upstream part of the pathway ( EGFR and Shc ) .	54	73	34	None
Malic enzyme activity was also inhibited by SNP treatment , which , together with malate dehydrogenase , is involved in reoxidation of the NADH produced during glycolysis under partial aerobic conditions where <ANNO_TYPE_gene> is inhibited .

One amino-acid sequence change was introduced into the TRAIL segment , namely an aspartate to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> change at position 269 ( D269H ) to generate the DR5-specific variant ( sTRAILDR5 ) , whereas the DR4-specific variant ( sTRAILDR4 ) was generated by a serine to argenine change at position 159 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( ) .	81	23	117	None
In 75 % of the cases where there is a confident binding partner on the same binding site , the binding affinity is higher in the EBM proteins than in the target , as shown by the binding free-energy calculated by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and X-score .

Cyclin D1 , in association with cyclin dependent kinase-4 and -6 , induces the cell to enter the S phase by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressing protein , which binds to transcription factors , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . In addition to the overexpression of cyclin D1 , other genes that overexpress in MCL , such as VEGF and Raf-1 , represent further possible targets for mTOR inhibitors . Indeed , a constitutive activation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and mTOR pathways either in MCL cell lines ( Granta 519 , Jeko-1 , and SP-53 ) or in primary cultures from 30 % of MCL patients has been reported. , Moreover , mTOR inhibitors in MCL could synergize with other “canonical” agents , such as vincristine <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , bortezomib , and rituximab , with resulting inhibition of Raf-1 , MAPK , and mTOR . ,	121 122	73	35	None
<ANNO_TYPE_gene> producing hepatoma family of receptors Whether this strategy can overcome the oncogenic effect of the recurrent somatic <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the first fibronectin Type III domain of EphA2 reported in 7 % of squamous cell lung carcinomas ( SQCLC ) is unknown . This mutation promotes cell survival and metastasis through activation of p130Cas which appears to be responsive to mTOR inhibition. [ ] In comparison , several kinase domain mutations in EPHA3 result in diminished phosphorylation of the EPHA3 receptor , which functionally attenuates the tumor-suppressive effects of wild-type EPHA3 through regulation of AKT activity.

In another phase II POCHER trial , the proportion of R0 resection was even higher ; it was achieved in 60 % of patients who were treated with chronomodulated chemotherapy with irinotecan , oxaliplatin , 5- fluorouracil and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . In conclusion , the results of our retrospective study showed that the patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation had worse prognosis than those with wt-BRAF , with lower response rates and progressed early during systemic treatment , consequently , with less possibilities to achieve resectability of metastatic disease .	38	54	55	None

Moreover , the orphan receptor <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> binding site has been identified as the response element in the proximal promoter PII of the rat aromatase gene , and TGF-β1 has been proved to inhibit SF-1 expression both at the transcriptional and translational levels in the mouse adrenocortical cell Y-1 and human adrenocortical <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . It has been proved that stimulation of testosterone production by hCG is associated with a decrease in Cx43 mRNA levels in Leydig cells both in vitro and in vivo . Given that Leydig cells are the main site of conversion of androgens into <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the testis , and that GJ-protein expression is regulated in part by steroid hormones in steroid-sensitive organs , it is essential to investigate whether there is a correlation between E2 synthesized by Leydig cells and Cx43 mediated intercellular communication .	99	5 6 7	53 54	None
Although the resistant cell line <ANNO_TYPE_gene> does not have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , it was found to have MET amplification . MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is associated with the development of various human cancers . Therefore , EGFR-TKIs fail to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway dependent growth signal because the constitutive phosphorylation of HER3 by MET occurs independent of EGFR activation , which causes the cells to acquire resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	5	11	None
A thymine to adenine transversion mutation results in the substitution of valine with glutamate ( V600E ) and converts B-RAF into a dominant transforming protein that causes the constitutive activation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway independently of RAS . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> B-RAF mutation appears in 4 % –15 % of CRC.– The possible relationship between of B-RAF mutational status and response to treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in 48 patients with mCRC was investigated by Benvenuti et al . B-RAF mutations were detected in 12,5 % tumors and they were mutually exclusive with K-RAS alterations .	63	32	39	None

While in healthy tissues , BRCA proteins may compensate for the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibition of single stranded DNA break repair , such buffering is lost in BRCA mutated tumors . Other examples of addiction dependent on tumor suppressor genes are the loss of PTEN and pRB , which lead to the stimulation of PI3K/mTOR ( Neshat et al. , ) and E2F ( Sellers and Kaelin , ) , respectively . Those defects consequently render tumor cells particularly sensitive to mTOR inhibitors and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( which inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_variant> activated topoisomerase II ) .	82	11	86	None
The parental MCF10a cell line showed greater resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than those with mutations in EGFR , KRAS , PI3K , BRAF and AKT ( Figure ) . Greatest sensitivity was seen within the PI3K mutated cells where IndexSUM values decreased from a relatively resistant index of 423 to 120 and 64 for the H1407R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> respectively .	9	59	56	None
Other studies reported that the expressions of Mus81 in different tumor cells correlated well with their sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ; also , Mus81 expression was increased in 5-FU-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. , Therefore , a targeting agent that is specific to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> is potentially a promising method for chemosensitivity improvement , especially in Mus81 positive breast carcinoma . The present study aimed to examine the effect of Mus81 on the chemosensitivity to 5-FU of MCF-7 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells .	18	41	76	None
Our study revealed that Mus81 suppression by siRNA could affect the cell cycle distribution of MCF-7 and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells by 5-FU treatment and that the proportion of G2 period was significantly increased in the siMus81 group compared to in the siCtrl group . Moreover , another study has shown that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> silenced by gene targeting could activate the intra-S-phase and G2/M checkpoints of cancer cells , thereby inducing an increase in sensitivity to MMC , MMS , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , ultraviolet radiation , ionizing radiation , and hydroxyurea .	77	50	17	None

H1975 cells [ TKI-resistant , EGFR exon 20 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and -21 mutations ] were treated for 24 h with either <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 200 nM ) , 17-DMAG ( 50 nM ) , belinostat ( 500 nM ) , panobinostat ( 50 nM ) or docetaxel ( 10 nM ) . Lysates were made , western blotted and probed with antibody against EGFR and GAPDH ( loading control ) ( A ) . 17-DMAG and belinostat decreased levels of activated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( p-Akt ) in TKI-resistant cells .	22	81	9	None
Intensive , continuous insulin treatment during the first two weeks after the diagnosis of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mellitus may improve beta-cell function during the subsequent year [ ] . More recent intervention trials used monoclonal antibody based therapies such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( anti-CD-20 ) [ ] , daclizumab ( anti-CD25 ) in combination with mycophenylate mofetil [ ] , anti-CD3 [ , , ] , and glutamate acid decarboxylase (GAD) [ ] .

Silencing CBS significantly inhibits ovarian cancer cell proliferation , metastatic nodule formation and sensitizes them to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> both in vitro and in pre-clinical orthotopic mouse models in vivo . Mechanistically , silencing CBS severely reduces cellular GSH levels , impairs <ANNO_TYPE_variant> production , activates tumor suppressors such as <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and inhibits NF-κB activation .	16	48	40	None
It would be interesting to study the relationship between circulating levels of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients with prolactinomas and their response to DA agonist treatment . Our study shows that the apoptosis of lactotropes induced by DA is mediated by <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and is an estrogen dependent process , involving p38 <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation .	12	49	39	None
To further confirm our results obtained with LY294002 and PD98059 , we investigated whether expression of dominant negative ( dn ) PI-3K ( delta p85 ) or dn MEK ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) will have similar effects on sensitising the MCF7RasG12V cells to the drug induced apoptosis . Effects of dn PI-3K ( Δp85 ) and dn MEK ( K97 M ) on <ANNO_TYPE_gene> induced drug resistance . MCF7RasG12V cells were transfected with plasmid containing HA-tagged MEK ( K97 M ) or HA-tagged PI-3K ( Δp85 ) for 16 h for transient expression , followed by a 8-h exposure to doxorubicin <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , or 5-fluorauracil , and a 16-h postdrug period in a medium containing 10 % CS FBS .	100 101	62	30	None
For <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , venlafaxine , and fluoxetine the data indicate that they might be Pgp substrates ; for citalopram the data are conflicting ( Rochat et al. , ; Uhr et al. , ) . Several variants of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> are known ( Kioka et al. , ; Mickley et al. , ; Hoffmeyer et al. , ; Ito et al. , ) , among these three <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( rs1045642 ) , C1236 ( rs1128503 ) , and G2677T ( rs2032582 ) – have been associated with altered Pgp activity .	1	38	66 67	None
Histamine , produced from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> through the action of histidine decarboxylase and stored in mast cells and basophils in the nasal mucosa , plays an important role in the immunoregulation of allergic inflammation .

Intriguingly , tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 as well as its physical association with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> was enhanced by the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or T315I mutation .	18	13	19	None
The carboxylate group of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and terminal NH2 of R563 moved away from each other ( 2.7 to 8.4 Å ) because of the missing E271 . A short beta sheet formed by the residues V306-N308 of HEXXH- ( X ) 18-E motif that possess two catalytically conserved <ANNO_TYPE_drug> residues coordinating with Zn2+ ion disappeared in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> system .	48	4	56	None
In fact , there was a markedly increased pErk signal in one NRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated cell line ( M207 ) , an observation consistent with data from others that has been attributed to loss of negative regulatory pathways [ , ] and enhanced signaling through C-Raf [ , ] . Therefore , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway signaling specifically in cell lines that harbor the BRAFV600E mutation .	52	54	13	None
The two main neurotransmitters eliciting contraction in human and rodent urinary bladder are adenosine triphosphate and acetylcholine , which act on a ligand gated ion channel ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor ) and two G-protein coupled receptors ( M2 and M3 muscarinic ) , respectively ( de Groat and Yoshimura ) . A common approach for studying how the functions of these receptors change in diabetes mellitus is to examine their contractile roles in isolated urinary bladder from animals treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> (STZ) . In smooth muscle , cAMP mediates relaxation , and activation of the M2 receptor inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and the relaxation elicited by forskolin and activation of β-adrenoceptors in gastrointestinal and urinary bladder smooth muscle ( Ehlert ) .	79	97 98	27	None
Very recently , sophisticated GEMM models of lung cancer were used to evaluate responsiveness to combined therapy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor selumetinib ( AZD6244 ) , according to a co-clinical trial effort [ ] . Co-clinical trials aim to anticipate , in suitable GEMMs , the results of concomitant human clinical trials , as well as to provide a rationale in the elaboration of clinically relevant hypotheses , useful for design of corresponding studies in human cancer [ , ] . In this model , the KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> activating mutation was associated either to TP53 or LKB1 loss in lung epithelium , to parallel selected human NSCLC cases harboring both oncogene activation ( KRAS ) and oncosuppressor ( TP53 or LKB1 ) loss .	18	21	89	None
The E7 oncoprotein binds to pRb family members and disrupts their ability to form complexes with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , increased expression of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> genes , many of which are required for cell cycle progression ( , ) . However , the E5 coding sequence is frequently deleted from the episomal viral DNA during integration into the host genome ( ) . Several recent studies have demonstrated that there are two distinct HNSCC etiologic risk groups : those who develop cancer in association with tobacco and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and those who develop HNC as a result of HPV infection ( – , ) .	84	21	16	None

In addition to upregulation of IGF1R and VEGF , frequent CN gain and increased mRNA expression of GSTT1 as well as significant overexpression of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> subfamily members were observed in wild-type/PDGFRA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> GISTs compared to KIT-mutant GISTs . CN gain of GSTT1 was closely associated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance .	46	24	31	None
Although this hypothesis has not been directly tested for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> specifically , syntaxin hypomorphs in C. elegans do have reduced sensitivity to volatile anaesthetics [ ] emphasizing a potential convergence of cellular effectors of various anaesthetics at the presynaptic terminal . On the other hand , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation acts to increase <ANNO_TYPE_gene> binding , at least for Munc18 [ ] .	9	52	47	None
EGFR gene mutations indicate sensitivity to gefitinib , and it was demonstrated that about 85 % of patients with NSCLC who obtained benefit from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment were found to have mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene [ - ] . EGFR mutations in exon 19 ( short in-frame deletions ) or 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( point mutation ) affect the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain leading to the activation of 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds , which function to compete with ATP [ ] . Anti-EGFR therapy can consequently lead to the downregulation of downstream signaling cascades , such as the PI3K/Akt , RAS/Erk , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and STAT pathways , responsible for cell proliferation and survival , resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis , respectively .	24	116	61	None
The mechanistic reasons behind the resistance to EGFR TKI are different , probably involving <ANNO_TYPE_variant> secondary mutation and MET amplification . Recently , some irreversible EGFR-TKIs and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors have shown antitumour activity in patients resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib in pre-clinical studies ( ; ; ; ; ) . The RRs were 3.4 % ( EGFR mutant ) and 0 % ( EGFR wild-type ) in neratinib , 4.3 % in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and 7.0 % in PF-00299804 .	72	27	14	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> , an oral small-molecule inhibitor of EGFR , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , HER2 and Ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EphB4) , in preclinical studies showed efficacy against EGFR-driven tumors , including those harboring <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ ] .	0	9	31	None
To further elucidate the link between p53 dependent transcription and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activity , we have screened by qPCR several p53 dependent genes upon 6 h of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment . Conversely , no transcription was induced in MEB-Med8A cells , where the p53 pathway was found to be mutated . The high levels of Fas receptor transcripts were reflected in the expression of the receptor at the plasma membrane in D283-MED and MHH-Med1 cells as measured by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry ( and Supplementary Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	26	10	84	None
Another group of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations is clustered in the ROC-COR bidomain . The R1441 position in the ROC/GTPase is mutated to cysteine , glycine or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( that is , R1441C/G/H ) in families with PD [ , - ] .

Under steady-state turnover conditions , H2OCbl forms at a rate of 9.5 × 10−3 min−1 in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> : MeaB complex in the absence of nucleotides . The presence of GTP decreases <ANNO_TYPE_drug> oxidation ~30-fold ( kobs = 3.0 × 10−4 min−1 ) . While the switch III mutant E183A protects MCM from oxidation to a similar degree as wild-type MeaB ( data not shown ) , the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( kobs = 0.9 × 10−4 min−1 ) and Q185A ( kobs = 1.7 × 10−4 min−1 ) mutants offer less protection .	32	17	68	None
In mammals , mTOR associates with mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 ( mLST8 ) , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> AKT substrate of 40 kDa ( AKT1S1 ) and regulatory associated protein of mTOR ( RAPTOR ) to form the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) . The mTORC1 activates protein synthesis through modulation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and the translational initiation factor eIF-4E binding protein 1 ( 4E-BP1 ) . mTORC1 is acutely sensitive to inhibition by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	16	58	None
The importance of D2 receptor involvement in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> actions on PRL production and cell proliferation is evident in the experiment where ethanol actions on lactotropes ' function were evaluated in clonal cell lines expressing various levels of D2 receptor isoforms . It was found that V cells , which lacked functional D2 receptors and had high basal levels of PRL , showed a significant reduction in PRL production following <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D2L receptor transfection . As described by an extended allosteric ternary complex model of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation , receptors spontaneously isomerize between active and inactive conformations , so receptors can modulate signaling pathways in the absence of an agonist .	7	85 86 87 88	69	None
Induced apoptosis was measured and calculated as described in a ( b ) , and mTOR and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> phosphorylation was analyzed by western blot ( c ) .

Different P-gp variants displayed higher levels of resistance ( A893S-M89T , L662R , and R669C ) or lower levels of resistance ( A893S , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , A893S-R669C , A893S-P1051A , W1108R , and W1108R-R669C ) relative to the P-gp reference ( A and B ) . The alleles varied widely in their ability to survive on high concentrations of daunorubicin and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . The replacement of Arg669 by Cys led to one of the most drastic gain-of-function effects on the ability of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> to confer drug resistance .	61	82	24	None
This <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and has been shown to play a critical role in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( RIG-I ) gene signaling , acting as a sensor of RNA virus infection [ ] . In fact , many elements of the regulatory pathways governing both the RIG-I pathway and IFN gene expression are themselves regulated by IFN . In turn , IFN may coordinate the upregulation of antiviral factors , as revealed by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , A3F , TRIM , tetherin and MxA mRNA expression levels in paired maternal blood and CB samples .	18 19	1 2	77	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Trastuzumab-DM1 ) is a new product in which the Trastuzumab moiety binds to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> on tumor cell surfaces and , upon internalization , the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin , thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and proliferation . Primary results from the EMILIA study , a randomized trial comparing Trastuzumab DM-1 to lapatinib and capecitabine , have shown that Trastuzumab DM-1 significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer . Further research is looking into inhibiting other targets such as mTOR , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , or AKT pathways .	0 1	16	96	None
The conclusion was that trametinib improved PFS and OS in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> V600E mutation or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> [ ] .

Note that the lack of bosutinib activity towards the TKL kinases is explained by the prevalence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> substitution in this family , which , as noted above , interferes with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding without compromising the hydrogen bond network . To confirm that the hydrogen bond network is responsible for this subfamily selectivity we verified the hydrogen bond status in compatible and incompatible members of two kinase subfamilies , the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and the EGFR family .	32	71	18	None
The <ANNO_TYPE_gene> based nanohybrids were prepared by simultaneous gelling and polymerization under methoxy <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and Fe ( NO3 ) 3·9H2O . From these characterizations , the optimized annealing temperature and mole ratios of oxidation were selected and the operating temperature of the PPy/γ-Fe2O3 nanohybrids was studied at 90 °C . From these results , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> sensors using conducting polymer/metals can be optimized with their kinds , detecting temperature , and annealing temperature .	13	1	54	None

That is , three other mutations in the a-Chelix were discovered : a threonine insertion at amino acid 1151 ( 1151Tins ) , a leucine to arginine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and phenylalanine to leucine ( F1174L ) .	8	11	67	None
Several studies have reported renal failure and tumor lysis syndrome during TKI based molecular targeted therapies , including with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma , with imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia , and with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.– Because <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> corresponding to SNP 421C&gt ; A reduces uric acid transport and those TKIs are substrates/inhibitors of ABCG2/BCRP , TKI therapy in patients with the SNP 421C&gt ; A ( Q141K ) may be at higher risk of tumor lysis syndrome .	33	43	39 40	None

Another study demonstrated that Akt is activated in AML blasts and that p70 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) and 4EBP-1 , downstream mediators of Akt signaling , also are phosphorylated in AML blasts [ ] . In a short-term culture system , most AML patient samples showed a dose dependent decrease in survival after incubation with LY294002 [ ] . Incubation of AML blasts with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> induced only a small decrease in survival of the cells [ ] .	63	63	14	None

In K562/R and HCT116/R cell lines , 10 μM JAI-51 restored the intracellular accumulation <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( Figure ) or mitoxantrone ( Figure ) with the same rate as the P-gp and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cyclosporine A , showing that JAI-51 is also an inhibitor of these pumps . Figure shows that 10 μM JAI-51 was able to induce a cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase , and an increase in both the percentage of apoptotic cells and the mitotic index ( data not shown ) of K562/R and S and HCT116/R and S cells . As the same effect of JAI-51 on the cell cycle was observed on all the cell lines tested , irrespective of the presence or not of an efflux pump , this shows that JAI-51 is not extruded by ( i.e. is not a substrate of ) P-gp ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells ) nor of BCRP ( HCT116R cells ) .	14 15	32	143	None
The importance of D2 receptor involvement in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> actions on PRL production and cell proliferation is evident in the experiment where ethanol actions on lactotropes ' function were evaluated in clonal cell lines expressing various levels of D2 receptor isoforms . It was found that V cells , which lacked functional D2 receptors and had high basal levels of PRL , showed a significant reduction in PRL production following D2S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor transfection . As described by an extended allosteric ternary complex model of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation , receptors spontaneously isomerize between active and inactive conformations , so receptors can modulate signaling pathways in the absence of an agonist .	7	85 86 87 88	71	None
Lazzara and colleagues found that SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation was not induced in response to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in the H3255 cells , which harbor the missense <ANNO_TYPE_variant> exon 21 mutation , suggesting that SHP2 activity may be less efficiently promoted by EGFR L858R and the STAT3 pathway may be more active . The main problem is that STAT3 activation is not abrogated by single EGFR TKI treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , afatinib or dacomitinib , - .	66	14	24	None
Surprisingly , the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation leads to decreased ability to activate ERK compared to WT EGFR which correlates with decreased EGFR internalization , reduced phosphorylation of SHP2 , hyperactivity of STAT3 and reduced sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .

Most B-Raf mutations involve the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> amino acid substitution , resulting in constitutive activation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signaling pathway . They are mutually exclusive of KRAS mutations and are thus a candidate for an independent biomarker for CRC [ ] . Studies on WT-KRAS tumors treated by either a combination of chemotherapy and cetuximab or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> alone have shown that progression free survival ( PFS ) and OS were significantly better among patient without mutated BRAF ( WT-BRAF ) [ ] .	55	16	5	None
Cyclin D1 , in association with cyclin dependent kinase-4 and -6 , induces the cell to enter the S phase by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressing protein , which binds to transcription factors , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . In addition to the overexpression of cyclin D1 , other genes that overexpress in MCL , such as VEGF and Raf-1 , represent further possible targets for mTOR inhibitors . Indeed , a constitutive activation of Akt and mTOR pathways either in MCL cell lines ( Granta 519 , Jeko-1 , and SP-53 ) or in primary cultures from 30 % of MCL patients has been reported. , Moreover , mTOR inhibitors in MCL could synergize with other “canonical” agents , such <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , doxorubicin , bortezomib , and rituximab , with resulting inhibition of Raf-1 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and mTOR . ,	119 120	135	35	None

Co-treatment of CAPE with chemotherapeutic drugs suppressed proliferation of PC-3 cells Finally , we investigated if co-treatment of CAPE at serum-available dosage ( 0–20 µM ) with commonly used chemotherapy drugs ( etoposide , paclitaxol <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , mitoxantrone , and estramustin ) can suppress growth of PC-3 cells more effectively than treatment with chemotherapy drugs alone .	95 96	12	34	None
<ANNO_TYPE_variant> and MET amplification , which can be detected in up to 20 % of EGFR NSCLCs secondarily refractory to EGFR TKIs , account for approximately 60–70 % of all known causes of acquired resistance <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Consequently , ongoing research is attempting to identify the mechanisms that may account for the 30–40 % of EGFR TKI-resistant , EGFR mutated tumors that do not carry EGFR mutations or MET amplification . Although increased activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) through the loss of IGF binding proteins and loss or reduction of the tumor suppressor <ANNO_TYPE_gene> have been associated with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in laboratory models , these mechanisms have not yet been validated in specimens from EGFR TKI-refractory patients .	35 36	98	0	None
We measured the apparent dissociation constant ( Kd , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) of ATP for WT and mutant Rho proteins in the absence of the RNA <ANNO_TYPE_drug> by using the UV-cross linking technique .

In fact , the pleiotropic effect of BCR/ABL transformation is mostly dependent on post-translational modifications ( e.g. phosphorylation ) of signalling molecules , like those involved in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , PI3K/Akt and STATs pathways , which control cell growth , survival and differentiation of haematopoietic cells by modulating the expression and/or activity of downstream effectors ( ; ) ( ) . Being the deregulated BCR/ABL kinase activity the cause of CML , targeting its catalytic domain was the most rationale approach for the rational development of small molecules that inhibit ABL kinase activity . In these CML-BC patients , imatinib resistance often depends on reactivation of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase activity via mechanisms involving BCR/ABL overexpression , gene amplification or mutations that suppress imatinib mediated kinase inhibition ( i.e. E255V and G250E ) or disrupt <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding ( i.e. <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ( ) .	134	28	138	None

The detrimental role of TNF-α in ALS is supported by the use of thalidomide <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to successfully inhibt TNF-α production , and significantly increase lifespan <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mice .	71 72	11	83 84	None
This is in contrast to the overlapping resistance profiles displayed for ABL inhibitors , such as imatinib , nilotinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which all show resistance to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutation , . There were some similarities observed between the resistance phenotype described in our studies and those reported by others . For instance , Piloto et al. reported activation of the Ras/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway in association with CEP-5214 and CEP-701 resistance , and we similarly observed elevated phospho-ERK1/ERK2 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in MOLM13-R-PKC412 cells , consistent with elevated FLT3 protein levels .	21	81	29	None

Using the erlotinib-sensitive EGFR mutant NSCLC cell line HCC4006 harboring the delL747-E749 , A750P mutation in EGFR exon 19 , Suda et al. established that mesenchymal status , not a specific oncogenic activated protein , could sufficiently promote loss of EGFR dependence to confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . More recently , Chang et al. confirmed that in the absence of the common second-site EGFR mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or MET amplification , acquired resistance to gefitinib occurs in EGFR mutated PC9 cells that have undergone EMT . In agreement with the above mentioned pro-survival role of EMT TFs , the authors observed that SLUG overexpression efficiently protected PC9 cells from gefitinib induced apoptosis ; accordingly , specific knockdown of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> can reverse secondary resistance to gefitinib .	46	117	65	None

Overexpression of both the wild-type and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> forms of BCRP conferred resistance to 9-aminocamptothecin , which was associated with reduced intracellular drug accumulation , but did not confer resistance to 9-nitrocamptothecin . These observations , in addition to the knowledge that BCRP confers resistance to topotecan and SN-38 , suggest that polar residues at the 9 or 10 position of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> may be important to facilitate interactions with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	60	68	6	None
Sasaki et al. reported that cells derived from pleural effusions of patients with EML4-ALK lung cancer who developed acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> displayed the gatekeeper <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation and high levels of expression of EGFR ligands ( EGF and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) .	21	38	25	None

In contrast , no significant changes in the phosphorylation of CENP-A were observed in tumour tissues from mice treated with paclitaxel , suggesting that 212Pb-TCMC-trastuzumab may interfere with the affinity of BubR1 for kinetocores , thus perturbing the mitotic spindle checkpoint induced by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is involved in DNA replication , DNA repair and mitosis , suggesting E2F affects cell cycle progression both at S-phase and during mitosis . To investigate whether these transcription factors may mediate a decrease of BubR1 expression by recruitment of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , E2Fs to the BubR1 proximal promoter region , the binding of E2F1 and E2F4 to the proximal BubR1 promoter was evaluated using a ChIP assay .	43	86 87	45	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity phenotypes of single point mutations in unc-18 We recently demonstrated that a single point mutation ( D216N ) in Munc18 acts biochemically by reducing binding to the assembled SNARE complex and that the orthologous mutation in C. elegans unc-18 ( D214N ) reduces sensitivity to both low and high concentrations of exogenous ethanol [ ] .

This drug was designed as a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL oncogene <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , known to be responsible for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) cells [ ] . The therapeutic effectiveness of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and relative absence of detrimental side-effects has made it a model for the development of an array of new therapeutic agents targeted to inhibit signal transduction enzymes , especially protein kinases . The recent discovery that 60–70 % of human melanomas have activating mutations in B-Raf ( with 80 % of these mutations caused by a single <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) make this protein kinase an especially promising target for inhibition [ , ] .	35	12 13 14	93 94	None

<ANNO_TYPE_variant> family members play an important role in the control of gene expression in several phases of the cell cycle and in multiple checkpoints . Their targets are diverse and cover genes controlling DNA replication and G1/S transitions , such as Cyclin A/E , Cdc6 , and Mcms , as well as products involved in DNA repair and G2/M transitions , such as Cdc25a , Cdk1 , Aurora-A and Survivin [ ] . In our previous study , E2F3 is also found to be a direct target of miR-200b , and inhibition of miR-200b , which led to E2F3 overexpression , contributed to resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] ( ) .	109	0	0	None

Whether this strategy can overcome the oncogenic effect of the recurrent somatic <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the first fibronectin Type III domain of EphA2 reported in 7 % of squamous cell lung carcinomas ( SQCLC ) is unknown . This mutation promotes cell survival and metastasis through activation of p130Cas which appears to be responsive to mTOR inhibition. [ ] In comparison , several kinase domain mutations in EPHA3 result in diminished phosphorylation of the EPHA3 receptor , which functionally attenuates the tumor-suppressive effects of wild-type EPHA3 through regulation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activity.

Poziotinib ( also known as HM781-36B ) , a new potent irreversible inhibitor of EGFR , HER2 , HER4 , and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood family of kinases inhibitor ( BTK , BLK , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) , demonstrated preclinical efficacy against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant at eightfold lower doses compared to afatinib . A different approach in addressing EGFR-TKI resistance involves the use of combination regimens . Therefore , the combination of erlotinib with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and the combination of erlotinib with MM-121 ( a fully human mAb that targets HER3 ) , in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs did not show sufficient clinical activity for further investigation in this population .	73	35	42	None

Exogenous lipoic acid equilibrates among different intracellular and extracellular compartments but can not substitute for covalently bound lipoic acid ( as the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> of mitochondrial complexes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase ) . This study is aimed at establishing the effects of lipoic acid , on glucose uptake , insulin signaling through the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway , and synaptic plasticity on a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease ( 3xTg-AD ) . This transgenic model harbors PS1 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , APP ( Swe ) , and tau ( P301L ) transgenes , shows progressive development of both plaques and tangles with increasing age in a region specific manner : ~6 month-old 3xTg-AD mice show diffuse amyloid plaques in different regions but tangle pathology is established at ~12 months [ ] .	22	55	80	None

Moreover , in approximately 20 % of cases , the MET gene amplification , independent of the mutation <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in the EGFR gene , may be a potential cause of drug resistance . This may generate acquired resistance via the activation of the ERBB signaling pathway . Studies employing the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> molecules ( inhibitors of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase ) and small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) preventing MET expression demonstrated that in the H820 cell line , ERBB signaling is highly dependent on the activity of MET .	50	55	18	None

Cyclin D1 , in association with cyclin dependent kinase-4 and -6 , induces the cell to enter the S phase by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressing protein , which binds to transcription factors , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . In addition to the overexpression of cyclin D1 , other genes that overexpress in MCL , such as VEGF and Raf-1 , represent further possible targets for mTOR inhibitors . Indeed , a constitutive activation of Akt and mTOR pathways either in MCL cell lines ( Granta 519 , Jeko-1 , and SP-53 ) or in primary cultures from 30 % of MCL patients has been reported. , Moreover , mTOR inhibitors in MCL could synergize with other “canonical” agents , such as vincristine , doxorubicin , bortezomib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , with resulting inhibition of Raf-1 , MAPK , and mTOR . ,	126 127	35	35	None

This final <ANNO_TYPE_drug> level ( 1600 μmole gDW-1 ) represents an increase between 10- and more than 1000-fold with respect to previous reports [ , , ] . The expression analysis of this response shows that both elicitors stimulated the expression of PAL , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , 4CL and STS independently of the anthocyanins/isoflavonoids ( CHS ) and lignins ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) pathways and therefore both induce stilbene biosynthetic genes in a highly specific way , in agreement to results reported by Saigne-Soulard et al.

The H1047R , E542K and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations , all detected in colorectal cancers , code for mutant proteins with higher lipid kinase activity than the wild-type protein [ , ] . These mutations result in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation and cellular transformation [ ] . In a clinical study involving 110 patients , none of the patients with the abovementioned PIK3CA gene mutations respond to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or cetuximab [ ] .	63	35	5	None
In addition to upregulation of IGF1R and VEGF , frequent CN gain and increased mRNA expression of GSTT1 as well as significant overexpression of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> subfamily members were observed in wild-type/PDGFRA <ANNO_TYPE_variant> GISTs compared to KIT-mutant GISTs .

More recently , Ramakrishnan and colleagues showed in a murine model that paclitaxel , cisplatin , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> all sensitize tumor cells to more efficient killing by CTL [ ] . In this system , however , the responsible mechanism on murine as well and human cancer cells went via upregulation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> on cancer cells which is required for granzyme B associated killing [ ] .	17	53 54 55	54	None
Tumors that harbor BRAF V600E mutations display high radiographic response rates to mutant-specific inhibitors such as PLX4032/RG7204/vemurafinib ( Plexxikon/Roche ) , and GSK2118436 ( GlaxoSmithKline ) , while patients whose tumors have certain KIT mutations ( L576P , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , V559A ) have disease sensitive to the KIT inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ) , , , , , , , , .

Another research by Mancuso et al. , also about the effects of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in SOD1 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) ALS mice , showed that the protective effects of resveratrol were associated with increased expression and activation of sirtuin 1 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in the ventral spinal cord .	12	39	16	None
While preparing this manuscript , Cortot et al. reported that PC-9 derived clones with acquired resistance to mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors and irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors in the absence of EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> demonstrate a significantly activated IGF-1R signaling , and pharmacological inhibition of IGF-1R restored sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors . Despite no patient data supporting the role of IGF-1R in acquired resistance to gefitinib/erlotinib , we are beginning to accumulate evidence from preclinical models indicating that clinical trials of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors with demonstrated activity in unselected NSCLC patients might play a role in association with EGFR inhibitors in the management of NSCLCs with acquired resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	105	78	30	None
<ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation analysis was positive for a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in codon 13 of the KRAS gene .

We observed that the cellular FTO protein is present in a dot-like manner in nucleoplasm , and partially colocalizes with splicing or splicing related speckle factors SART1 ( U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP associated protein 1 ) and SC35 ( serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 ) , and RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at Ser2 ( Pol II-S2P ) ( and ) , but does not colocalize with telomere marker TRF1 , replication site PCNA , Cajal body marker <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , cleavage body marker CstF64 , or P-body marker DCP1A ( ) . To investigate whether FTO is related to mRNA processing , we performed the same immunostaining experiment upon inhibition of Pol II-S2P transcription with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( ActD ) . Quantitative foci analysis showed that the FTO foci number per cell was significantly decreased from 43±7 ( −ActD ) to 22 ± 5 ( +ActD ) with P-value less than 0.0001 , similar to that observed for <ANNO_TYPE_variant> S2P from 90 ± 12 ( −ActD ) to 24 ± 5 ( +ActD ) , but not SC35 ( ) , upon transcription inhibition ( ) .	111 112	74	154	None

Anti-nociceptive tolerance induced by morphine , meperidine , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was shown to be reduced by PKC inhibitors while DAMGO induced tolerance and MOR desensitization was shown to rely on <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( Hull et al. , ) . Whereas in vitro experiments showed that S375 is phosphorylated by GRK5 upon morphine exposure ( Doll et al. , ) and S375 phosphorylation plays a major role in MOR desensitization ( Schulz et al. , ) , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> knock-in mice still present anti-nociceptive tolerance upon acute and chronic exposure to morphine ( Grecksch et al. , ) .	9	30	75	None
This is in contrast to the overlapping resistance profiles displayed for ABL inhibitors , such as imatinib , nilotinib , and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which all show resistance to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> gatekeeper mutation , .

Although a retrospective study and the PICCOLO ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , Irinotecan and Ciclosporin in Colorectal Cancer Therapy ) trial have demonstrated a reduced response to cetuximab and panitumumab for patients with NRAS mutations , , further work is required to demonstrate the predictive capacity of these mutations . The serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf is an effector in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signaling pathway , downstream of K-Ras . Mutations in the proto-oncogene BRAF are present in 5 % –10 % of the metastatic CRC population and are also mutually exclusive of KRAS mutations . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is the most common of all BRAF mutations ( present in 90 % of cases ) , and is enriched in a subset of patients who are female , greater than 70 years of age , with KRAS WT right sided colon cancer .	8	57	91 92	None

Again , the activity of this resistance mechanism could be suppressed through combined MET and BRAF or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibition . Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and Wnt pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of everolimus . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( T315I ) following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	146	17	134	None
Jin et al also reported that the HDAC inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , inhibits HDAC activity by downregulating cyclin D1 protein expression in colonic carcinoma cells in xenografted mice . In conclusion , our study confirms that valproic acid significantly suppresses growth of Kasumi-1 cell xenograft tumors in nude mice via cell cycle arrest . The antitumor activity of valproic acid is possibly attributable to its direct downregulation of cyclin D1 , CDK4/6 , and cyclin E1 expression , blockage of Rb phosphorylation , reduction of free <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , inhibition of HDAC activity , attenuation of histone acetylation in the p21 promoter region , upregulation of p21 expression , and induction of cell cycle arrest .	10	86	86	None
Another possibility is that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> BRAFV600E mutants have alternative signaling at the level of Raf , as has been described for cell lines with acquired resistance to a different Raf-inhibitor , AZ628 , which show increased signaling through C-Raf [ ] . The increase in pErk in an NRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant cell line could be explained by abrogation of negative feedback loops mediated mainly by dual specificity phosphatases ( MKPs/DUSPs ) , as reported with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors [ , ] , and the recent description of increased C-Raf signaling when heterodimerizing with inhibited B-Raf in BRAF wild type cells [ , ] .	4	75	49	None
The data demonstrated that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> could prevent <ANNO_TYPE_variant> via a direct protective action on β cells without alteration of periphery insulin sensitivity [ ] .

Brain metastasis is observed in approximately 10 % of breast cancer patients , and recurrence is common due to reduced efficiency of chemotherapy drugs , such as doxorubicin and carboplatin , and targeted therapy drugs , such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , to cross the blood-brain barrier , . A very recent study showed that the binding of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> to S1PR1 in brain capillaries decreases basal <ANNO_TYPE_gene> transport activity and improves the delivery of therapeutic agents like paclitaxel to the brain .	38	64	56	None
We established an <ANNO_TYPE_drug> lung cancer cell line , PC-9/ER3 , by continuous exposure of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells to erlotinib . The PC-9/ER3 cells did not carry the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation or MET gene amplification .	3	15	27	None
Finally , the substrate-free structure ( PDB <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) lacked sufficient electron density for assignment of residues 42-51 in the N-terminal region and 229–239 of the F-G loop ; the 2F9Q further contained a polymorphic V374M substitution and two additional mutations , L230D and L231R , introduced to increase solubility . While the N-terminal region of CYP2D6 was modified by truncation to increase expression and solubility , and a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> tag introduced for purification purposes on the C-terminal end , CYP2D6 in the 3QM4 structure otherwise represents CYP2D6*1 . Backbone dependent rotamers were added to *1 to create *34 ( R296C ) , *17-2 ( T107I , R296C ) , *17-3 ( T107I , R296C , S486T ) , and *53 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , A122S ) using UCSF Chimera package .	70	7 8	123	None
As shown in Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , there was no significant change in the proportion of CD45/COL-I/α-SMA cells between these two groups . These data suggest that inhibition of LPA-LPA1 signal pathway selectively prevents BMSC differentiation into myofibroblasts in the fibrotic lung . To test the effect of Antapla1 on lung fibrosis in mice challenged with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , we measured the production of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> as well as collagens in the damaged lung tissues .	55	62	4	None
Taken together , altered expression of pluripotency and differentiation genes , including increased expression of SOX2 , decreased expression of other SOX gene families , and alterations of the expression of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> genes and pocket protein genes , may suggest a role for cancer initiating cells/cancer stem-like cells in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance .	49	31	31	None

Another study compared miR-34a the levels of human colorectal cancer DLD-1 cells <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 5-FU ) -resistant with the parental counterpart of DLD-1 cells . It was not only found that 5-FU-resistant cells expressed significant higher levels of miR-34a , but also that the introduction of miR-34a into resistant cells significantly inhibited cell growth and induced a considerable attenuation of 5-FU-resistance , which was accompanied by reduced expression of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family proteins .	12	69	71	None

Additionally , we have shown that the preinfection of mice with T. crassiceps can reduce the incidence of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> induced by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> (STZ) up to 50 % , mainly by lowering blood glucose levels to below 200 mg/dL , leukocyte infiltration into the pancreas and , in consequence , the degree of insulitis . Such effects last for at least 6 weeks after induction of T1D . These protective effects were associated with high systemic levels of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , a reduction in TNF-α circulating levels , and the induction of AAM populations ; however , analysis of the spleens did not show increased populations of Treg cells [ ] .	21	77	18	None
Gold standard bisulfite based methodologies using a standard sodium bisulfite treatment are able to reveal an overall profile of 5meC modifications , rather than a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> profile alone , although caution is required when interpreting the changes in DNA methylation as they do not reflect the changes in the individual 5meC metabolites . The present study identified that the DAPK1 gene is significantly methylated ( including possible hydroxymethylation ) in CML patients and this is correlated with mutations that result in resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Notably , one in two of the patients exhibiting both <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and M351T mutations demonstrated DNA methylation in the DAPK1 promoter region compared with non-resistant patients ; however , none of the patients with T315I alone demonstrated DAPK1 methylation .	83	25	95	None

Histology and immunohistology were performed according to standard diagnostic procedures . The severely neutropenic patient was supported with both G-CSF and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and underwent ambulatory chemotherapy with the purine analog 2-CDA ( 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , cladribine ) according to a schedule of 0.1 mg/Kg IV once per week for 4 to 6 weeks .	68	55	27	None
In addition , the presence of common activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene ( exon 19 deletion and exon 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation ) confers strong sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib , which are selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR [ , ] . These EGFR mutations are more commonly encountered in ADCs [ ] . Furthermore , the use of vascular endothelial growth factor ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) inhibitors ( eg , bevacizumab ) has been demonstrated to be associated with an increased risk of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage in patients with SQC [ ] .	36	74	29	None
Furthermore , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and BV8S2 are absent in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treated group ( a treatment known to destroy regulatory T cells ) , but present in 50 % of the B cell reconstituted animals .

The latter binds the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> CysLT1R to mediate HASMC contraction . Unlike our data showing a decreased expression of CysLT1R in response to Pam3CSK4 , poly ( I:C ) , LPS , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and iE-DAP , Morishima et al. have recently shown that poly ( I:C ) decreased the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and increased M3R expression without affecting histamine receptor H1R or CysLT1R , which correlated to intracellular calcium mobilization .	34	4 5 6	54	None
The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant mimics the open conformation of SHP-1 and dN1 is the deletion of N-SH2 domain of SHP-1 , and both serve as constitutive activators . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> potently relieved the autoinhibition of SHP-1 and contributed to growth inhibition ( A ) Left : Modeled docking of regorafenib into the N-SH2 site of SHP-1 ( pdb code : 3PS5 ) . The N-SH2 domain was in gold , the C-SH2 domain was in marine , the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> domain was in hot pink , and the linkers between them were in gray .	27	76	1	None
Our unpublished data show that Dinaciclib exposure results in downregulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and sensitized cyclin E1-dependent ovarian cancer cells to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Hence , Dinaciclib may have a dual effect on BRCA1 and BRCA2 by causing <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mediated transcriptional downregulation and inhibiting CDK1/2 mediated activation of the BRCA proteins ( Figure A ) .	22	38	38	None
<ANNO_TYPE_gene> , located on human chromosome 11q21–22 , is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family , and one of the functional and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> membrane receptors .

The two main neurotransmitters eliciting contraction in human and rodent urinary bladder are adenosine triphosphate and acetylcholine , which act on a ligand gated ion channel ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor ) and two G-protein coupled receptors ( M2 and M3 muscarinic ) , respectively ( de Groat and Yoshimura ) . A common approach for studying how the functions of these receptors change in diabetes mellitus is to examine their contractile roles in isolated urinary bladder from animals treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> (STZ) . In smooth muscle , cAMP mediates relaxation , and activation of the M2 receptor inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and the relaxation elicited by forskolin and activation of β-adrenoceptors in gastrointestinal and urinary bladder smooth muscle ( Ehlert ) .	79	97 98	27	None
The supernatant was divided into two portions ( one with 5 μg <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> antibody , the other with 4 μg <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> G as the negative control ) , and followed by mild shaking overnight at 4°C .	21 22	13	12 13	None
Down-regulation of C4H , HCT , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> or CcoA-OMT was previously reported to cause reduction of total lignin in transgenic alfalfa , Arabidopsis , and poplar – . The Log2 ( S7/S8 ) fold value of unigene annotated as F5H was lowest ( –6.25 ) ( ) . F5H , a cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenasea , , is a key enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of ferulic acid , coniferaldehyde , and coniferyl <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , leading to sinapic acid and syringyl lignin ( S lignin ) biosynthesis .	75	8	6	None
However , remarkably , an exposure–response relationship for bosutinib has been observed for patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML with regard to CCyR , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and cumulative CHR at 1 year . Bosutinib effectively targets most IM-resistance conferring BCR-ABL mutations , with the exception of the highly resistant T315I ( resistant to IM , dasatinib , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and bosutinib ) and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations ( resistant to dasatinib and bosutinib ) .	56	23	62	None
Other examples of addiction dependent on tumor suppressor genes are the loss of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and pRB , which lead to the stimulation of PI3K/mTOR ( Neshat et al. , ) and E2F ( Sellers and Kaelin , ) , respectively .

Poziotinib ( also known as HM781-36B ) , a new potent irreversible inhibitor of EGFR , HER2 , HER4 , and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood family of kinases inhibitor ( BTK , BLK , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) , demonstrated preclinical efficacy against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant at eightfold lower doses compared to afatinib . A different approach in addressing EGFR-TKI resistance involves the use of combination regimens . Therefore , the combination of erlotinib with cetuximab , and the combination of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> with MM-121 ( a fully human mAb that targets HER3 ) , in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs did not show sufficient clinical activity for further investigation in this population .	79	35	42	None
The importance of D2 receptor involvement in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> actions on PRL production and cell proliferation is evident in the experiment where ethanol actions on lactotropes ' function were evaluated in clonal cell lines expressing various levels of D2 receptor isoforms . It was found that V cells , which lacked functional D2 receptors and had high basal levels of PRL , showed a significant reduction in PRL production following D2S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor transfection . As described by an extended allosteric ternary complex model of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation , receptors spontaneously isomerize between active and inactive conformations , so receptors can modulate signaling pathways in the absence of an agonist .	7	85 86 87 88	71	None
Also , centrosome amplification induced by a transient G1/S arrest because of the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , generated aneuploidy both in human and MEFs with pRb dysfunction [ ] .

The importance of D2 receptor involvement in ethanol actions on PRL production and cell proliferation is evident in the experiment where <ANNO_TYPE_drug> actions on lactotropes ' function were evaluated in clonal cell lines expressing various levels of D2 receptor isoforms . It was found that V cells , which lacked functional D2 receptors and had high basal levels of PRL , showed a significant reduction in PRL production following <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D2L receptor transfection . As described by an extended allosteric ternary complex model of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation , receptors spontaneously isomerize between active and inactive conformations , so receptors can modulate signaling pathways in the absence of an agonist .	21	85 86 87 88	69	None

Despite the higher rates of molecular response , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is emerging as a common mechanism of failure of second-line TKIs [ ] . It was reported that combined treatment with nilotinib or dasatinib with SGX393 ( inhibitor of native and T315I-mutant BCR/ABL ) might be useful for reduction of BCR/ABL mutants in Ph-chromosome positive leukemia [ ] . In addition , it was shown that combined treatment with dasatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA ) <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor ) led to depletion of wild-type and mutant forms of BCR/ABL expressing cells [ ] .	71	79 80	8	None
In summary , we have discovered that tolerogenic DC engineered ex vivo for low co-stimulation ability increase frequency and numbers of IL-10 expressing B-cells in vitro and in vivo , consequent to concomitant proliferation of pre existing IL-10+ B-cells and conversion of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> B-lymphcytes into IL-10 expressing cells without affecting their immunosuppressive potential in vitro . We also discovered that these DC-sensitive putative Bregs expressed receptors for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> which is produced by the tolerogenic dendritic cells . Taken together , our findings usher a potential new therapeutic approach to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> immunotherapy which involves suppresisve B-cells , possibly homogeneous Bregs , together with approaches and molecules that stabilise their suppressive ability and expand their numbers in vitro ( e.g. RA , IL-10 , IL-21 ) .	67 68	42	90	None
miRNA upregulation has been linked to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and fulvestrant resistance [ , ] . Crosstalk may occur between certain classes of miRNAs such as miR-101 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and miR-221/222 , which translationally repress the estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα ) and could also be responsible for the decreased sensitivity to anti-estrogen drugs [ , , ] . Further , on comparing ERα negative breast cancer cells lines such as MDA-MB 468 , HS578T and MDAMD-231 with ERα positive cell lines such as MCF-7 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and MDA-MB 361 , there was an expressional difference in miR-221 and miR-222 .	6	26	84 85	None

Even though the transporter expression , localization and function of ABCC1 and ABCC2 have been extensively studied , there are only very limited data that more convincingly suggest any clinical relevance of naturally occurring SNPs in ABCC1 ABCC2 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . Several reports suggesting that ABCG2 SNP analysis might be a useful strategy to predict systemic exposure to ABCG2 substrate drugs is becoming increasingly prevalent [ ] . Of particular importance are recent studies that have demonstrated that subjects with a decreased ABCG2 activity owing to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant are at an increased risk of gefitinib induced diarrhea [ ] , and altered pharmacokinetics of 9-aminocamptothecin [ ] , diflomotecan [ ] , irinotecan [ ] , rosuvastatin [ ] , sulfasalazine [ , ] and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	126	39	87	None

Historically antifolate drugs such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or edatrexate have shown very little activity in clinical trials with melanoma patients although these trials were performed before the discovery of BRAF and RAS as drivers of melanomagenesis [ , ] . The lack of response in melanoma patients can be explained by several mechanisms of resistance such as melanosomal sequestration of drugs , the upregulation of both DHFR and the pro-survival transcription factor MITF in response to MTX , or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and Chk1 mediated effects , as recently described [ - ] .	5	79	79	None

P22phox is an essential component of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymor- phism results in an amino acid polymorphism ( His/Tyr ) at residue 72 of p22phox involving a potential heme- binding site [ 12 ] . Because the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> residue is con- sidered to be a candidate for the ligand of the heme prosthetic group of cytochrome b , it has been revealed that this polymorphism is associated with the function of p22phox and significantly lower basal and NADPH- stimulated vascular superoxidase production in human blood vessels from patients with atherosclerosis [ 13 , 14 ] .	39	6 7	10	None

As described by an extended allosteric ternary complex model of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation , receptors spontaneously isomerize between active and inactive conformations , so receptors can modulate signaling pathways in the absence of an agonist .	21	85 86 87 88	69	None
In the native enzyme structures ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , WT2 , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and D622Nx-H2H3 ) the hydrophobic pocket ( green ) is preformed for recognizing a proline , the catalytic residues Ser538 and D622/N622 are kept in an inactive conformation by H-bonding with Arg624 , and the catalytic residue His657 is disordered . Addition of the inhibitor zPP ( yellow ) to preformed native crystals induces interdomain closure and brings residue Asp150 of the β-propeller domain into the active site to capture Arg624 in an orientation that allows it to H-bond the main chain carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor ( D622N-zPP ) .

Analogous secondary mutations of the BCR-ABL gene in case of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) [ ] and the KIT gene in case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor [ ] have previously been reported as mechanisms of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance , which is also a TKI . The structural similarity between ABL and EGFR tyrosine kinases is considerably high , and T315I in ABL corresponds to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in EGFR [ ] . Using <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells , Azam et al. revealed that a gatekeeper threonine mutation stabilizes an active conformation of these tyrosine kinases through a network of hydrophobic interactions known as the hydrophobic spine and has a transforming function [ ] .The authors anticipated that this regulatory mechanism would be conserved across the kinase family .	37	72	65	None

A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following imatinib .	73	17	143	None

The promoter of the cyclin A1 gene , CCNA1 is not <ANNO_TYPE_variant> dependent and , consistently , increasing doses of Roscovitine did not repress cyclin A1 basal transcription levels in contrast to cyclins A2 , B , D and E . However , we demonstrated that Roscovitine at doses preferentially inhibiting CDK2 but not CDK7 and 9 completely abolished cyclin A1 DNA damage induced upregulation , thus suggesting that residual CDK2 activity is required for cyclin A1 upregulation . In addition Roscovitine co-administered with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> was able to largely modify the patterns of cell cycle phase distribution in comparison to doxorubicin only treatment .	84	11	11	None
