To determine whether additional mutations in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase domain were associated with progression of disease in these patients , we performed direct sequencing of all of the exons ( 18 through 24 ) encoding the EGFR catalytic region in the available tumor specimens . However , careful analysis of the exon 20 sequence chromatograms in both forward and reverse directions from this patient 's lung biopsy specimen obtained after disease progression on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> demonstrated an additional small peak at nucleotide 2369 , suggesting a C→T mutation ( A , upper panels ; ) .

Collectively , these findings imply that the exon 20 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation was present on the same allele as the exon 21 L858R mutation , and that a subclone of cells harboring these mutations emerged during drug treatment .

Consistent with this , the T790M mutation has been shown not to abrogate the catalytic activity of wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] . The T790M mutation could also affect the kinase activity or alter the substrate specificity of mutant EGFRs , such that a proliferative advantage would be conferred upon cells bearing the mutation . Consistent with this , the H1975 NSCLC cell line reported here to contain both <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L858R did not to our knowledge undergo any prior treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib ; the doubly mutated cells must have become dominant over time through multiple passages in vitro .	81	18	68	resistance or non-response
The mutant 2369 T peak was small , possibly because <ANNO_TYPE_drug> had been discontinued in this patient for 4 mo at the time pleural fluid tumor cells were collected ; thus , there was no selective advantage conferred upon cells bearing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . To determine whether the 2369 C→T mutation was a previously overlooked <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation found in NSCLCs , we re-reviewed exon 20 sequence tracings derived from analysis of 96 fresh-frozen resected tumors [ ] and 59 paraffin embedded tumors [ ] , all of which were removed from patients prior to treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor .	10	56	42	resistance or non-response

As shown in , out of 11 patients who first received <ANNO_TYPE_drug> after lung surgery and then showed recurrence , 8 patients had the delE746-A750 mutation and 3 had L858R mutation in their primary lung tumors . Four had the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in dissemination or metastatic cytological samples .	36	8	65	resistance or non-response
<ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation status including wild-type ( WT ) , E746-A750 del ( del ) , L858R and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> was determined by both IHC and RNA-LNA PCR clamp assays with 11 clinical samples of cancer patients refractory to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment .	37	0	17	resistance or non-response
For acquired resistance , secondary mutation in the EGFR gene <ANNO_TYPE_variant> – or alternative EGFR independent activation of cell growth signaling pathways including c-Met activation is well-known , . The loss of PTEN expression is one of the acquired resistant mechanisms , which was demonstrated by isolating <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mutants from PC9 cells which harbor activating mutation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , .	47	57	10	resistance or non-response

Both erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> show similar kinase inhibition selectivity based on quantitative analysis of small molecule-kinase interaction maps for 38 kinase inhibitors , and show therapeutic efficacy against progressive NSCLC patients – . The most common activating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations are in-frame deletion in exon 19 ( delE746-A750 ) and the point mutation replacing leucine with arginine at codon 858 of exon21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) – .	3	37	62	sensitivity
In addition to the well characterized causes of drug resistance in lung cancer patients , elucidation of further mechanism for acquired resistance is essential for the development of new <ANNO_TYPE_gene> targeted drugs .

In a previous study of EGFR-TKI treatment in chemonaive patients with specific EGFR mutations , such as exon 19 deletions and substitutions at <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , the treatment effect of EGFR-TKIs was sustained for up to 8–9 months and was significantly superior to the treatment effect of platinum based chemotherapy [ ] . In the Phase III randomized control trial of gefitinib vs. carboplatin/paclitaxel in Asia ( IPASS ) [ ] , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment led to significantly longer progression-free survival ( PFS ) than carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment among the patients who had pulmonary adenocarcinoma with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations ( hazard ratio for progression or death : 0.48 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.36–0.64 ; p & lt ; 0.001 ) .	71	93	23	sensitivity

However , treatment with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib will eventually fail because of the development of acquired drug resistance resulting from amplification of the MET proto-oncogene or the threonine-to-methionine amino acid substitution at position 790 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , which is detected in 50 % of clinically resistant patients , .	4	38	35	resistance or non-response
In this study , we design , synthesize and evaluated a number of novel quinazoline derivatives by exchanging the positions of the C5 and C6 substituents and varying the C4-amino functionality of gefitinib , and report that compound V1801 having a trifluoromethyl group at the C5'-position and a bromine at the C2'-position of the aniline moiety substituted at the C4 position of quinazoline core overcomes <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance via up-regulation of Noxa , suggesting a novel strategy to fight against NSCLC with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	65	81	82	resistance or non-response

Approximately 70–80 % of NSCLCs harbouring a somatic mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene respond <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , , . However , acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy almost always develops after a median of approximately 10 months from the onset of treatment , even in patients who exhibit an initial dramatic response to these agents . Acquired resistance has been associated with a secondary mutation in the EGFR gene , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , , which has been detected in approximately 50 % of cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs , .	19 20	16	74	resistance or non-response
One of the proposed mechanisms of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and erlotinib is the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation on exon 20 . As the theoretical advantage of afatinib versus the first-generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> did not translate into progression-free survival gains , maybe the clinical relevance of possible inhibition of T790M is minimal , at least in the first-line setting , when T790M positive clones are rarely detected .	8	28	13	resistance or non-response
Preclinical studies have shown superior activity of afatinib over first-generation TKIs , mainly due to ( 1 ) irreversible binding , which confers stronger binding affinity and potency , ( 2 ) ability to circumvent first-generation TKI resistance mechanism <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in exon 20 , and ( 3 ) effectiveness against multiple HER-endothelial growth factor receptors . Recently , TKIs have been investigated in eight phase 3 trials as first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activating mutations , in comparison with platinum based chemotherapy doublets : <ANNO_TYPE_drug> trials IPASS , , West Japan , North-East Japan , , and First-SIGNAL ; erlotinib trials OPTIMAL , and EURTAC ; and afatinib trials LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 .	89	77	39	resistance or non-response
As the theoretical advantage of afatinib versus the first-generation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> did not translate into progression-free survival gains , maybe the clinical relevance of possible inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is minimal , at least in the first-line setting , when T790M positive clones are rarely detected . A limitation of our study is the indirect comparison of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , erlotinib , and afatinib with one another , which relies on the quality of variance component estimates .	55	9	26	resistance or non-response
However , subsequent resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> is inevitable even among the initial good responders , mostly related to acquired <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) or c-met amplification [ , ] .	5	19	22	resistance or non-response
However , the acquired resistance is not completely explained by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in all cases [ ] . The presence of heterogenous malignant clones with different EGFR mutation status may confer differential sensitivity to the two EGFR-TKIs [ ] . Also , the different treatment efficacy between the two <ANNO_TYPE_gene> has been proposed to be related to drug pharmacokinetics [ ] , with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> given at largely sub-maximal tolerated dose ( MTD ) in contrast to erlotinib at MTD .	64	50	11	resistance or non-response

<ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation tests were available in four patients , in whom three of them were positive for point mutation in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L861Q ) and one was negative .

As in our study , iTARGET and EURTAC reported generally mild to moderate AEs ( rash and diarrhoea ) , although 13 % of patients ( 11 out of 84 ) in EURTAC did experience grade-3/4 rash with erlotinib ( there were no grade-3/4 rash events with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> reported in our study ) . Mutation subtype analysis results in iTARGET and EURTAC were also similar to our study , with exon 19 deletions and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> the most common mutation subtypes detected . Consistent with the mechanism of action of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKIs , rash and diarrhoea were the most commonly reported AEs .	47	89	74	sensitivity

Furthermore , the NSCLC cell line H1975 harbors both the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and T790M mutations , and is resistant to inhibition by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or erlotinib , unlike cell lines that express the L858R allele alone . In the H1975 cell line , it was possible to obtain adequate quantities of RNA to confirm that the L858R and T790M mutations are present on the same allele , as would be predicted if T790M confers resistance to inhibition of the L858R allele .

Dacomitinib ( PF‐00299804 ) is a potent , irreversible , oral small‐molecule inhibitor of HER1/EGFR , HER2 , and HER4 tyrosine kinases with antitumor activity in both gefitinib‐sensitive and gefitinib‐resistant , including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , preclinical NSCLC models .	18 19	5	73 74	resistance or non-response
Three of the 4 patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> status ascertained from an archival biopsy initiated dacomitinib more than 90 days after discontinuing from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Patients previously treated with investigational <ANNO_TYPE_gene> therapies were eligible to participate in the study and did not represent protocol deviations , provided the study sponsor provided written agreement .	22	29	6	resistance or non-response
However , subsequent resistance to gefitinib is inevitable even among the initial good responders , mostly related to acquired EGFR mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) or c-met amplification [ , ] . Large-scale phase III clinical trials have demonstrated survival benefit with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> but not gefitinib as second- or third-line treatment of advanced NSCLC , suggesting pharmacological differences between the two <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ , ] .	41	60	22	resistance or non-response
An acquired <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) has been reported to occur upon failure of gefitinib and is also predictive of resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ , ] .	23	2	5	resistance or non-response
However , the acquired resistance is not completely explained by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in all cases [ ] . The presence of heterogenous malignant clones with different EGFR mutation status may confer differential sensitivity to the two EGFR-TKIs [ ] . Also , the different treatment efficacy between the two <ANNO_TYPE_gene> has been proposed to be related to drug pharmacokinetics [ ] , with gefitinib given at largely sub-maximal tolerated dose ( MTD ) in contrast to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at MTD .	77	50	11	resistance or non-response
<ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation tests were available in four patients , in whom three of them were positive for point mutation in exon 21 ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and L861Q ) and one was negative . At the time of initiation of gefitinib treatment , most of the patients were in good performance status ( & gt ; 90 % in ECOG 0 or 1 ) . Gefitinib was prescribed at standard dosage of 250 mg daily and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> at 150 mg daily .	74	0	23	sensitivity

Therefore , we tended to believe that patients’ response to therapy mainly contributed <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Although there were studies proved that patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation showed a strong trend to a more favorable outcome comparing to codon 12 mutations , we failed to observe this in our study potentially because of the limited number patients of this study .	13 14	24	25	resistance or non-response

As we expected , patients bearing low abundance ( & lt ; 30 % ) of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation had higher disease control rate to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than other groups ( 44.4 % for & lt ; 30 % group vs 5.6 % for 30∼80 % group and 12.5 % for & gt ; 80 % group , P = 0.038 ) . If we excluded a disease control patient who carried a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in & gt ; 80 % group , the trend that low abundance had higher disease control rate was more obvious .	24	16	71	resistance or non-response

In 2009 , the FDA updated the product labels for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab , indicating that patients with CRC tumours harbouring <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations were unlikely to derive benefit from these therapies . However , these guidelines may have to be re-visited , as it has been shown ( in one study ) that patients with a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation showed improved survival compared to patients with other mutations , indicating that this patient group may respond to therapy [ ] .	10	21	56	resistance or non-response

Ihle et al. demonstrated that a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation activates both PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways , whereas a G12C mutation causes robust RAL signaling . The prevalence of NRAS mutations was higher than reported in other studies or in the COSMIC database ( 14–20 % ) . , BRAF mutations have been mainly reported in melanoma , colorectal , papillary thyroid , and ovarian cancer. , In colorectal cancer they are associated with a dismal prognosis , however , unlike <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations , BRAF mutations might not be predictive of lack of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> benefit .	91	79	6	sensitivity

The <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation has been described as a predictor of tumor aggressiveness in metastatic disease [ , , ] and also of low RRs to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab [ , , , ] .	26	1	2	resistance or non-response
This consists of BRAF mutational analysis at <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and MLH1 promoter methylation , both of which are associated with sporadic CRC [ , ] . At present , inhibitors of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> have been tested in vitro and the inhibitor PLX4032 has been shown to potentiate the anti-proliferative action of 5-FU therapy [ ] . At present , further in vivo studies investigating the action of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( BAY 43-9006 ) and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the metastatic setting are being undertaken .	74	30	7	resistance or non-response
Most B-Raf mutations involve the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> amino acid substitution , resulting in constitutive activation of the MEK-ERK signaling pathway . They are mutually exclusive of KRAS mutations and are thus a candidate for an independent biomarker for CRC [ ] . Studies on WT-KRAS tumors treated by either a combination of chemotherapy and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or cetuximab alone have shown that progression free survival ( PFS ) and OS were significantly better among patient without mutated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( WT-BRAF ) [ ] .	53	75	5	resistance or non-response

Moreover , the introduction/presence of the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> allele in CRC ( DiFi-BRAF , COLO-205 and HT-29 ) cell lines impaired the therapeutic potential of anti-EGFR moAbs . Thus , in the clinical setting , the therapeutic effect of anti-EGFR moAbs could be restored by a two-hit approach that blocks the EGFR pathway in multiple locations . In accordance with previous reports ( ; ) , we found that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation predicted resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment in the subpopulation of patients that have received this kind of therapy .	74	69	7	resistance or non-response
In accordance with previous reports ( ; ) , we found that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation predicted resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment in the subpopulation of patients that have received this kind of therapy . Furthermore , the prognostic impact of BRAF mutation remains significant not only in the whole of the study but also in the subpopulation of patients that have not received an anti-EGFR moAbs . In summary , BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations , which are correlated with MSI-H status and cyclin D1 overexpression , characterise a subgroup of patients with poor prognosis .	17	12	69	resistance or non-response
For this reason , we hypothesized that in the AIO KRK-0104 trial primary tumor location in the left colon might have a favorable prognostic effect in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors , but not in patients with KRAS mutant tumors when receiving <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based first-line therapy . In fact , OS and PFS differed significantly when comparing left- to right sided tumors . This effect was driven by patients with KRAS codon 12/13 wild-type tumors and seemed also present in those patients that presented with KRAS codon 12/13 wild-type but <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant tumors .	42	90	91	resistance or non-response
In the colorectal cancer setting , preclinical in vitro models of resistance to the anti-EGFR mAbs <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab include cell lines showing mutations of the K-Ras gene , most frequently in codon 12 of exon 2 , such as SW480 , LS174T , HCT116 , LoVo cells . These mutations produce a single amino acid change resulting in mutant Ras proteins that are insensitive to GAP function and constitutively active , with consequent activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling [ ] . Furthermore , several colorectal cancer cell lines ( VAC0432 , SNU-C5 , HT29 , KM20 , WiDr ) are considered valuable models of resistance to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) inhibitor vemurafenib [ ] because of the high levels of EGFR expression .	16	108 109	111	resistance or non-response

Although it is difficult to make any comparison , because our patients were not selected according to specific systemic therapy , these results are comparable with those reported in previous studies claiming that 19 to 23 % patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and irinotecan based chemotherapy and with previously unresectable liver-only metastases underwent resection.– In a recently published clinical study BOXER , where the patients with unresectable liver-only metastases were treated with oxaliplatin , capecitabine and bevacizumab , R0 resection was achieved in 40 % of patients .	93	49	50	sensitivity

Using a representative cohort of 229 sporadic CRCs , we identified the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation as an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with advanced and recurrent CRC . The presence of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation is associated with a significantly higher risk of dying of cancer related causes , independently of other factors such as age , gender , PS , KRAS status , pathological finding , number of metastasis and metastatic sites , in agreement with other recent studies ( ; ; ; ) . However , our study focused on the advanced and recurrent group who received systemic chemotherapy , including fluoropyrimidines , in combination with oxaliplatin , irinotecan , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and anti-EGFR antibody in several lines .	113	34	13	sensitivity
Similarly , our case demonstrated BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , wild-type KRAS and no evidence of microsatellite instability on immunohistochemical workup . However , we did not assess our case for CpG island methylation status . From the therapeutic standpoint , wild-type KRAS status would imply tumor responsiveness to novel biological molecules such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) compounds ; however , a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation and rhabdoid morphology would signify the opposite : a poor response to conventional and novel chemotherapy regimens and a likely refractory disease with relapses .	53	65	6	sensitivity

For example , three BCR-ABL mutations ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , Y253H , and F317L ) have a predicted role in abrogating binding of imatinib to BCR-ABL in resistant patients . The second-generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , binds to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> with less stringent conformational requirements and was shown to be effective in inhibition of imatinib-resistant mutants .	35	39	7	None

DISCUSSION Recent studies suggest that NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations are less responsive to EGFR-TKIs compared with patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and exon 19 deletions.– However , the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients with uncommon mutations has not been fully elucidated .	12	22 23 24 25	48	None
We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the NEJ002 study to evaluate the effectiveness of gefitinib against NSCLC with G719X or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . The NEJ002 study , comparing gefitinib and standard <ANNO_TYPE_drug> chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for patients with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations , demonstrated no significant difference in OS between gefitinib and carboplatin-paclitaxel .	30	39	20	None
In contrast to other phase 3 trials investigating EGFR-TKIs for patients with common EGFR mutations of exon 19 deletion and L858R , the NEJ002 is the only study that included uncommon EGFR mutations of G719X and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . This study showed that the PFS and OS tended to be shorter among patients treated with first-line gefitinib compared with PFS and OS among those treated with first-line <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the uncommon <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation group ( supplementary Table S2 , Supplemental Digital Content 1 , http : //links.lww.com/JTO/A494 ) .	66	70	36	None

Retrospective studies and case reports suggest that some uncommon mutations are associated with sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs.– These mutations <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 18 , which accounts for approximately 3 % of EGFR mutations , and L861Q in exon 21 , which represents approximately 2 % of EGFR mutations . However , these uncommon EGFR mutations have not been clearly shown to be predictive markers for the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs because of their low frequency . To investigate the efficacy of gefitinib in patients with uncommon mutations , we conducted a post-hoc analysis of the NEJ002 , which compared gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> as first-line therapies for advanced NSCLC with activating <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations .	100	109	18 19	None

However , the T315I mutant remained resistant to nilotinib at concentrations & lt ; 10 μM. , Nilotinib also potently inhibited tyrosine autophosphorylation of the E255K , E255V , F317L <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , and F486S Bcr-Abl mutants , and these effects were not associated with decreases in Abl or Bcr-Abl protein levels . Overall , these results supported the conclusion that many <ANNO_TYPE_drug> Bcr-Abl mutants were relatively or absolutely more sensitive to nilotinib . Nilotinib also inhibits to a lesser extent platelet derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR-alpha ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , as well as c-kit dependent cell proliferation .	62	90	30 31	None

As shown in Figure , BaF3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL were highly sensitive to imatinib , dasatinib and ponatinib , whereas <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and BaF3-G250E-BCR-ABL cells were resistant to both imatinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .

Despite the fact that the a dose of 30 mg/day showed excellent results in the Phase I trial , researchers proceeded to Phase II study using the 45 mg/day dose to ensure coverage of any and all <ANNO_TYPE_gene> TKI resistant clones.– The Phase II Ponatinib Ph+ALL and CML Evaluation (PACE) trial enrolled 449 patients : 267 with CP-CML , 83 with accelerated phase ( AP ) -CML , and 94 with blast crisis ( BC ) -CML or Ph+ALL ( ) . Patients were eligible for the study if they were resistant or had unacceptable side effects to dasatinib or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , or harbored the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation .	100	37	105	None

In the case of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , the median PFS in the PROFILE studies was 7.7 months . Similarly , in EGFR mutated tumors , the efficacy of TKIs is limited by the development of resistance mechanisms , the commonest of which is the secondary <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation within exon 20 of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene. , The presence of T790M gatekeeper resistance resulting in failure of treatment accounts for about 50 % of secondary resistance with other mechanisms including activation of bypass mechanisms such as amplification of the MET proto-oncogene and transformation into small-cell lung cancer .	4	51	44	None
Other amino acid substitutions observed include <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , G1202R , and S1206Y substitutions , as well as a 1151 threonine insertion .

There are several promising agents for patients with activating EGFR mutations who experience disease progression of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and have a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation , and multiple clinical trials will be available . Trials investigating adjuvant erlotinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC and comparing erlotinib to erlotinib plus bevacizumab in metastatic <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutant NSCLC are ongoing . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , when compared to platinum pemetrexed , results in a superior ORR and progression-free survival in patients with ALK rearranged NSCLC , and ceritinib is a second-line option for this patient population , but patients need to be monitored closely for adverse events and the need for dose reductions .	59	53	24	None

NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor activating kinase domain mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) often initially respond to treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment invariably develops. , There is no effective therapy for patients who develop such resistance . Work by our group and others has shown that resistance to EGFR TKI treatment can occur through a secondary resistance mutation in EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , activation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase , and activation of the NF-kB pathway.– .	32	85	79	None
Carboplatin was discontinued and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> was initiated as a second-line chemotherapy .

Many drugs have been studied in patients who progressed after treatment with a reversible <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , including XL-647 , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and neratinib , with little success . Combinations of therapy such as cetuximab plus erlotinib and gefitinib plus everolimus have also been tried . The most promising drug thus far has been afatinib ( BIBW2992 ; Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma , Ingelheim , Germany ) , , an ErbB family blocker with reported in vitro and in vivo activity against EGFR mutant tumors harboring exon 19 deletions , exon 21 L858R mutations and the exon 20 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> “resistance” mutations .	19	14	95	None

Although a retrospective study and the PICCOLO ( Panitumumab , Irinotecan and Ciclosporin in Colorectal Cancer Therapy ) trial have demonstrated a reduced response to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and panitumumab for patients with NRAS mutations , , further work is required to demonstrate the predictive capacity of these mutations . The serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf is an effector in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signaling pathway , downstream of K-Ras . Mutations in the proto-oncogene BRAF are present in 5 % –10 % of the metastatic CRC population and are also mutually exclusive of KRAS mutations . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is the most common of all BRAF mutations ( present in 90 % of cases ) , and is enriched in a subset of patients who are female , greater than 70 years of age , with KRAS WT right sided colon cancer .	25	57	91 92	None
Indeed , even if the co-existence of KRAS and EGFR mutations could be interpreted as double mutation occurring in the crizotinib-resistant tumor cells , the possibility of different tumor clones with activation of EGFR and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signaling as different mechanisms of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> appeared to be an alternative , perhaps more likely explanation . Furthermore , the identified <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutation , although not reported before , was located near mutations known to be sensitive to EGFR-TKI , such as L858R and L861X .	41	35	57	None

The dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR might be advantageous over single inhibition by suppressing a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> feedback loop that leads to the pathway reactivation .

Overexpression of wild type EGFR induced high and sustained phosphorylation of EGFR , Shc , MEK ( mitogen activated protein kinase kinase ) and ERK ( extracellular signal regulated kinase ) , while the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation reduced these response levels . In addition , H1299L858R , which is supposed to be more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than H1299EGFR-WT , was effectively inhibited by gefitinib administration at the downstream part of the signaling pathway ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and ERK ) compared with H1299EGFR-WT , but , surprisingly , not at the upstream part of the pathway ( EGFR and Shc ) .	54	73	34	None

<ANNO_TYPE_gene> has also been shown to signal synergistically with EGFR as part of a broad signaling network that cooperatively drives activation of these downstream pathways.

After we determined that the PI-3K/Akt and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathways were not involved , we examined the possible involvement of the JNK pathway and found that the mechanism by which EGF protected SiHa cells from <ANNO_TYPE_drug> induced apoptosis was sensitive to inhibition of JNK activity by SB202190 .	44	17	0	None
Correspondingly , direct injection of a liposome encapsulated miR-7 plasmid into established EGFR-TKI sensitive and resistant tumors bearing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutant resulted in significant tumor regression in conjunction with repression of EGFR , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and IRS-1 expression . In head and neck cancer , miR-7 functioned in a synergistic manner with erlotinib to render FaDu <ANNO_TYPE_drug> cells susceptible to the growth inhibitory activities of the drug .	56	34	19	None

In conclusion , the combination of bortezomib and mitotic inhibitors such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , docetaxel , vincristine or BI 2536 is an effective strategy for targeting of both TKIs -resistant and -sensitive Bcr-Abl positive leukemic cells . These regimens are able to inhibit Bcr-Abl activity and its downstream signaling , and to activate <ANNO_TYPE_gene> dependent cell death . In addition , these regimens are able to overcome the resistance to imatinib , dasatinib and nilotinib , brought about by Bcr-Abl protein overexpression or Bcr-Abl mutations ( including <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , making them attractive potential therapies for Bcr-Abl positive leukemias such as CML , especially for those resistant to current treatments .	12	53	87	None

In addition , significant constitutive activity of recombinant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptors expressed in mammalian cells has been described previously . Hence , the ligand independent changes in hormone production were due to constitutively activated D2 receptors in transfected cells . V cells that lacked functional D2 receptors did not respond to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in respect to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> production .	50	54	8	None
The importance of D2 receptor involvement in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> actions on <ANNO_TYPE_gene> production and cell proliferation is evident in the experiment where ethanol actions on lactotropes ' function were evaluated in clonal cell lines expressing various levels of D2 receptor isoforms . It was found that V cells , which lacked functional D2 receptors and had high basal levels of PRL , showed a significant reduction in PRL production following D2S and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor transfection .	7	10	71	None
They were derived by long-term culture in oestrogen-free media and do not represent a model for long-term <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment . Although it was previously reported that both E2 and 4-OHT are capable of activating the AP-1 pathway ( Astruc et al , 1995 ; Webb et al , 1995 ) , E2 and 4-OHT did not induce <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activity in either the MCF-7 nor <ANNO_TYPE_variant> PKC cell clones ( Figure 4B and C ) .	17	57	64	None
Also in the same cells , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> upregulated miR-574-3p and overexpression of this miRNA inhibited cell proliferation , migration , and invasion in vitro and in vivo , and apoptosis was induced through reduction of B cell lymphocyte xL (Bcl-xL) and activation of caspase-3 and -9 . The Ras related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( RAC1 ) , epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> binding protein p300 (EP300) were confirmed as targets of miR-574-3p , and inhibition in cell proliferation , migration , and invasion was observed when these three targets were knocked down . The expression of miR-574-3p was found to be significantly lower in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and DU145 and prostate tumour tissues compared with RWPE-1 normal prostate cells and adjacent normal tissues , respectively .	6	109	66	None
After re-introduction of gefitinib , 25 % achieved partial remission and 75 % showed <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . A different response to the same EGFR-TKI regimen after a drug holiday can be explained with tumor heterogeneity . In a retrospective analysis of an erlotinib retrial , Becker et al.

<ANNO_TYPE_gene> activation status was positively correlated with IL-6 expression and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in AS2 derived cells In this current study , we used <ANNO_TYPE_variant> as active form Stat3 , and S3D and S3F as inactivated forms of Stat3 .	10	0	23	None
According to the analysis of other mutations , they proposed testing of KRAS status , if not mutated , then of BRAF and NRAS status , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> exon 20 mutation in order to improve the objective response up to 40 % in selected patients . In our retrospective study , 26.7 % of patients , all with KRAS wild-type tumours , who had previously unresectable liver-only metastases , underwent surgical resection after systemic therapy , with R0 resection achieved in 38 patients ( 21.6 % ) ; one of those was patient with the BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation . Although it is difficult to make any comparison , because our patients were not selected according to specific systemic therapy , these results are comparable with those reported in previous studies claiming that 19 to 23 % patients treated with bevacizumab- and irinotecan based chemotherapy and with previously unresectable liver-only metastases underwent resection.– In a recently published clinical study BOXER , where the patients with unresectable liver-only metastases were treated with oxaliplatin <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and bevacizumab , R0 resection was achieved in 40 % of patients .	171 172	27	96	None
The <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> polymorphism was studied in Caco-2 and WiDr HF- and LF-adapted cells as well as in MCF-7/MR.

Several studies have reported renal failure and tumor lysis syndrome during TKI based molecular targeted therapies , including with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma , with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for chronic myelogenous leukemia , and with flavopiridol for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.– Because the Q141K variant of ABCG2/BCRP corresponding to SNP 421C&gt ; A reduces uric acid transport and those TKIs are substrates/inhibitors of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , TKI therapy in patients with the SNP 421C&gt ; A ( Q141K ) may be at higher risk of tumor lysis syndrome . A defect in the pharmacological interaction has been suggested between sunitinib and another ABCG2/BCRP germ-line mutant allele , 1291T & gt ; C. Remarkably , sunitinib reversed wild-type ABCG2/BCRP mediated drug resistance and competitively inhibited ABCG2/BCRP mediated estrone 3-sulfate transport and the binding of 125I-iodoarylazidoprazosin to ABCG2/BCRP . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant of ABCG2/BCRP , which is expressed from a germ-line mutant allele 1291T & gt ; C , was insensitive to sunitinib mediated inhibition .	25	60	134	None
<ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment of I83-E95 and WAC3CD5+ cells resulted in demethylation of miR-9-3 and the emergence of U-MSP signal on day 5 respectively ( Figure ; Additional file : Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , with the re-expression of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> as shown by TaqMan stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR ( Figure ) .	0	36	29	None
Second , along the same line of inquiry , unlike <ANNO_TYPE_drug> which is preferentially active in tumor cells bearing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of BRAF , reducing levels of pERK1 and/or 2 does not depend on the mutation status of the melanoma cell . Indeed , it has been observed that within melanoma lesions , there can be both clones containing both BRAF mutant alleles as well as wild-type BRAF [ ] . Third , by silencing ERK1 and/or ERK2 , the feedback loop between ERK and RAF and MEK is interrupted as clearly observed by comparing treatment of cells with MEK inhibitor which led to increased phospho-MEK as reported by others [ ] , in contrast to the decrease in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> after our shRNA approach ( see below for more discussion ) .	10	120	20	None

While in the Y67H variant , the removal of the hydrogen bond between Tyr67 and Met80 weakens the heme-Met80 ligation , leading to that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> easily detaches from heme ring . The cleavage of Fe-S bond in the Y67H variant results in a channel in the heme crevice to H2O2 and substrate for peroxidation , which is a characteristic of the cardiolipin induced conformational transition in cyt c . Therefore , at pH values from 4.0 to 5.2 , two following elements may stimulate the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant with the highest peroxidase activity : 1 ) His67 acts as a distal <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ; 2 ) vacancy generation specific for the substrate or H2O2 loading .	100	24	85	None
Based on our data , we hypothesized that PRR of hnRNP L binds to PTB and cooperatively suppresses inclusion of exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . We thus examined the role of PRR of hnRNP L on the interaction with PTB . Histidine tagged hnRNP L ( His-L ) , its PRR deleted variant ( His-L-ΔPRR ) , histidine tagged hnRNP LL ( His-LL ) , and its PRR inserted variant ( His-LL-PRR ) were expressed in SH-SY5Y cells , and they were immunoprecipitated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> antibody in the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	82	88	21	None
Of note , responding patients had a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ratio of more than 5 and both of our MET amplified patients treated with a c-MET inhibitor had a ratio inferior to this . Interestingly , a recent series showed that the level of HER-2 amplification predicted sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] In this study , a ratio of 4.7 was discriminative of sensitive patients , which suggests that a similar relation can be explored for MET amplification and sensitivity to c-MET inhibitors . Additionally , one of the patients receiving a c-MET inhibitor in our series had a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> MET variant .	47	7	97	None
In this report we also demonstrated that Dasatinib , an Abl/Src dual inhibitor , is capable of cooperating with GNF-2 in inhibiting the proliferation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells carrying the native or the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutated Bcr-Abl .

Overexpression of wild type EGFR induced high and sustained phosphorylation of EGFR , Shc , MEK ( mitogen activated protein kinase kinase ) and ERK ( extracellular signal regulated kinase ) , while the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation reduced these response levels . In addition , H1299L858R , which is supposed to be more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than H1299EGFR-WT , was effectively inhibited by gefitinib administration at the downstream part of the signaling pathway ( MEK and ERK ) compared with H1299EGFR-WT , but , surprisingly , not at the upstream part of the pathway ( EGFR and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) .	54	96	34	None

MCF7ErbB2 cells were pretreated with ethanol with/without <ANNO_TYPE_variant> for 48 hours , then the cells were seeded on fibronectin precoated plates and allowed to attach for 1 hour in the presence/absence of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and/or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	32	34	7	None
As shown in Figure , ethanol increased the adhesion of MCF7ErbB2 cells to fibronectin and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> significantly inhibited <ANNO_TYPE_drug> enhanced adhesion in a concentration dependent manner .	18	15	15	None
Consistent with this , we found that the introduction of R1275Q into EML4-ALK had no negative impact on sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( IC50 47 ± 8 nm ) . As expected , the IC50 values for viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutants were all above that for <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells expressing native EML4-ALK , with IC50s ranging from 231 to 981 nm . The three most resistant mutants , L1196M , S1206R , and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , all had IC50s within twofold of parental , ALK negative , Ba/F3 cells ( IC50 1176 nm ) .	20	48	74	None
After the cells were exposed to gefitinib for 24 h , Ba/F3-L858R cells were unable to proliferate while Ba/F3-L858R-L747S and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> cells continued to grow even in the presence of 1 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( E ) . These results suggest that execution of apoptosis may be impaired by the presence of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and , to a lesser extent , L747S .	31 32	20	51	None

Correspondingly , direct injection of a liposome encapsulated miR-7 plasmid into established EGFR-TKI sensitive and resistant tumors bearing the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR mutant resulted in significant tumor regression in conjunction with repression of EGFR , RAF-1 and IRS-1 expression . In head and neck cancer , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> functioned in a synergistic manner with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> to render FaDu Erlotinib-resistant cells susceptible to the growth inhibitory activities of the drug .	52	45	19	None
The data suggest that low <ANNO_TYPE_gene> level may neutralize the negative effects of the EGFR T790M mutation on <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity and that high BRCA1 expression may lead to de novo EGFR TKI resistance potentially through increased DNA damage repair capacity [ ] . In addition to EGFR T790M , primary EGFR TKI resistance may also be due to other secondary mutations in EGFR ( e.g. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) that occur in cis with an activating EGFR kinase domain mutation ( e.g. , L858R ) [ ] .	18	5	66	None

Lof rab-3 worms are resistant to the effects of depressive concentrations of exogenous <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation of Munc18 increases the interaction between Munc18 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] without affecting binding to syntaxin or Mint proteins [ ] .	13	28	18	None
The latter binds the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> CysLT1R to mediate HASMC contraction . Unlike our data showing a decreased expression of CysLT1R in response to Pam3CSK4 , poly ( I:C ) , LPS , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and iE-DAP , Morishima et al. have recently shown that poly ( I:C ) decreased the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2R and increased <ANNO_TYPE_variant> expression without affecting histamine receptor H1R or CysLT1R , which correlated to intracellular calcium mobilization .	34	4 5 6	57	None
This then indicates that whatever the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is doing at high <ANNO_TYPE_drug> concentrations , it acts both downstream and independent of functional rab-3 , which itself is downstream of R39C .

The D2L isoform is predominant in the rat pituitary , striatum , and olfactory tubercle , whereas <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is more abundant in the hypothalamus.- Activation of either isoform in rat lactotrophs mediates dopamine suppression of the PRL gene . While PRL directly inhibits secretion of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary , there is accumulating evidence that PRL also exerts a direct inhibitory effect on <ANNO_TYPE_gene> actions in the ovary . Physiological levels of PRL suppress follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) -induced estradiol production through a reduction in aromatase expression and PRL increases <ANNO_TYPE_drug> production by augmenting StAR , P450scc , and 3βHSD expression in granulosa cells .	93	64	17	None
It is hypothesized that signaling through redundant pathways involving the PI3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) , VEGF , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and EGFR pathways contributes to such drug resistance ( Jang and Atkins , ) . For example , colon cancers with BRAF V600E mutations do not respond to vemurafenib due to feedback activation of EGFR . Therefore , in pre-clinical studies , vemurafenib is strongly synergistic with EFGR inhibitors like <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for colon cancers expressing BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations ( Prahallad et al. , ) .	71	19	77	None
Meanwhile , it is important to emphasize that preclinical studies have evidenced that RET activating mutations at codon 804 ( V804L , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) cause resistance to some TKIs , such as vandetanib .

That is , three other mutations in the a-Chelix were discovered : a threonine insertion at amino acid 1151 ( 1151Tins ) , a leucine to arginine ( L1152R ) and phenylalanine to leucine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	8	11	74	None
Several studies have reported renal failure and tumor lysis syndrome during TKI based molecular targeted therapies , including with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma , with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for chronic myelogenous leukemia , and with flavopiridol for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.– Because the Q141K variant of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> corresponding to SNP 421C&gt ; A reduces uric acid transport and those TKIs are substrates/inhibitors of ABCG2/BCRP , TKI therapy in patients with the SNP 421C&gt ; A ( Q141K ) may be at higher risk of tumor lysis syndrome . A defect in the pharmacological interaction has been suggested between sunitinib and another ABCG2/BCRP germ-line mutant allele , 1291T & gt ; C. Remarkably , sunitinib reversed wild-type ABCG2/BCRP mediated drug resistance and competitively inhibited ABCG2/BCRP mediated estrone 3-sulfate transport and the binding of 125I-iodoarylazidoprazosin to ABCG2/BCRP . The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant of ABCG2/BCRP , which is expressed from a germ-line mutant allele 1291T & gt ; C , was insensitive to sunitinib mediated inhibition .	25	43	134	None

Very recently , sophisticated GEMM models of lung cancer were used to evaluate responsiveness to combined therapy of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and the MEK inhibitor selumetinib ( AZD6244 ) , according to a co-clinical trial effort [ ] . Co-clinical trials aim to anticipate , in suitable GEMMs , the results of concomitant human clinical trials , as well as to provide a rationale in the elaboration of clinically relevant hypotheses , useful for design of corresponding studies in human cancer [ , ] . In this model , the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> activating mutation was associated either to TP53 or LKB1 loss in lung epithelium , to parallel selected human NSCLC cases harboring both oncogene activation ( KRAS ) and oncosuppressor ( TP53 or LKB1 ) loss .	18	88	89	None
In this model , the KRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> activating mutation was associated either to TP53 or LKB1 loss in lung epithelium , to parallel selected human NSCLC cases harboring both oncogene activation ( KRAS ) and oncosuppressor ( TP53 or LKB1 ) loss . The latter were obtained via nasal instillation of adenoviruses expressing CRE recombinase in the appropriate genetic models . The study showed that the combination therapy with selumetinib was more effective than <ANNO_TYPE_drug> alone in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and K-Ras/p53 mice , while K-Ras/Lkb1 mice where showing primary resistance to the combination therapy .	74	77	6	None

Our results show that bortezomib and paclitaxel combined treatment is able to target the TKIs-resistant cell lines with the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in Bcr-Abl . Bortezomib in combination with the PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536 induces a significant downregulation of the total levels and phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl , a decrease of downstream phosphorylated <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and caspase dependent cell death in imatinib- , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and nilotinib-resistant and -sensitive K562 cell lines	60	51	19	None
We used the crystal structure of FLT3 crystallized in an inactive conformation and with related inhibitor−kinase complexes : for example , ABL complexed <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in closed and inactive conformation ( PDB:3CS9 ) ; Ppy-A bound to the active conformation of ABL-T315I ( PDB:2Z60 ) ; and JAK2 bound to isoquinoline in active conformation ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) . In this model , the pyrimidine ring of SAR302503 makes hydrophobic contacts with Leu 616 and Leu 818 . Given the lack of direct interaction of SAR302503 with resistant variants <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and D835F/Y , our model suggests that these mutations would destabilize the open and active conformation rather than inactivating the kinase , therefore having sufficient catalytic activity to support cellular transformation .	23 24	55	88	None
More than 50 % of lung adenocarcinomas (LAD) from East Asian non-smokers harbor EGFR mutations , and these tumors have been termed oncogene addicted to reflect their dependence on EGFR mediated pro-survival signaling and their high susceptibility to apoptosis induced by EGFR-TKIs ( e.g. gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) ( ) . The most frequently occurring mutations in the EGFR gene ( in-frame deletion in exon 19 at codons 746–750 or a single-base <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> in exon 21 ) predict an improved clinical response to first-line oral EGFR-TKIs compared with standard platinum based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) ( , ) . There is accumulating evidence that genetic mutations in cancer-driver genes , tumor suppressors , and amplified oncogenes are linked to specific alterations in metabolic activity in cancer cells , involving proteins such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) , fumarate hydratase (FH) , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , K-RAS , and BRAF ( ) .	46	148	72 73	None

Global induction of apoptosis with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , cycloheximide or puromycin was shown to lead to a loss of cell coupling , probably due to caspase-3 mediated degradation of Cx43 , in primary bovine lens epithelial and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts [ ] . In fact , Stat3 inhibition in cells transformed by Src or the Large Tumor antigen of Simian Virus 40 led to apoptosis [ , , ] , possibly due to activation of the transcription factor <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family , potent apoptosis inducers , by these oncogenes .	5	77	77	None
Dietary vitamin D3 restriction ( 0.025 IU/g feed ) decreases <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and motor performance , improves early disease severity and delays disease onset compared to a diet with adequate vitamin D3 ( 1 IU/g feed ) in the high-copy <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mouse model of ALS . We hypothesize that the attenuation of early disease severity and the delay in disease onset may have been due to a transient compensatory increase in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> under conditions of decreasing calcidiol concentrations , whereas the reduced functional performance may be due to changes in intramuscular calcium regulation and a decrease in contractile protein synthesis .	70	10	39	None

In another phase II POCHER trial , the proportion of R0 resection was even higher ; it was achieved in 60 % of patients who were treated with chronomodulated chemotherapy with irinotecan , oxaliplatin , 5- fluorouracil and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . In conclusion , the results of our retrospective study showed that the patients with BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation had worse prognosis than those with wt-BRAF , with lower response rates and progressed early during systemic treatment , consequently , with less possibilities to achieve resectability of metastatic disease .

In the colorectal cancer setting , preclinical in vitro models of resistance to the anti-EGFR mAbs cetuximab and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> include cell lines showing mutations of the K-Ras gene , most frequently in codon 12 of exon 2 , such as SW480 , LS174T , HCT116 , LoVo cells .

In fact , the pleiotropic effect of BCR/ABL transformation is mostly dependent on post-translational modifications ( e.g. phosphorylation ) of signalling molecules , like those involved in the RAS/MAPK , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and STATs pathways , which control cell growth , survival and differentiation of haematopoietic cells by modulating the expression and/or activity of downstream effectors ( ; ) ( ) . Being the deregulated BCR/ABL kinase activity the cause of CML , targeting its catalytic domain was the most rationale approach for the rational development of small molecules that inhibit ABL kinase activity . In these CML-BC patients , imatinib resistance often depends on reactivation of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase activity via mechanisms involving BCR/ABL overexpression , gene amplification or mutations that suppress <ANNO_TYPE_drug> mediated kinase inhibition ( i.e. E255V and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) or disrupt imatinib binding ( i.e. T315I ) ( ) .	122	30	130	None

Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of everolimus . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( T315I ) following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Although the MET <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation renders cancers insensitive to type I MET inhibitors , conformal differences between these and type II compounds may allow treatment of MET Y1230H mutant cancers or prevent the emergence of resistance due to the mutation. ,	126	39	131	None

Intracellular <ANNO_TYPE_variant> produced by SphK1 can bind to TRAF2 ( tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2 ) and function as a <ANNO_TYPE_drug> required for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and consequently , Lys-63 linked polyubiquitination of RIP1 ( receptor interacting protein 1 ) and NF-κB ( nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ) activation [ ] . Similarly , it has been shown that S1P enhances cIAP2 ( cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 ) mediated K63 linked polyubiquitination of IRF-1 ( interferon regulatory factor-1 ) , which is essential for IL-1 induced production of chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5 [ ] . Furthermore , S1P produced by SphK2 in the nucleus acts as an endogenous inhibitor of specific histone deacetylases ( HDAC1 and HDAC2 ) , thereby regulating gene transcription , including that of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitor p21 [ ] .	22	136 137 138	1	None
In rat liver epithelial cells , GN4 , peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ligand induced not only the Pyk2-p38 MAPK pathway but also the Y845 phosphorylation induced <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway , the latter of which can be blocked by the application of either PP2 or the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine , suggesting that Src and ROS are involved in this signaling system [ ] . In the cell proliferation and malignancy of MCF7 and SUM149 breast cancer cells , Src dependent ( i.e. , dasatinib-sensitive ) Y845 phosphorylation ( i.e. , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation-sensitive ) signaling was shown to require the activity of p38 MAPK , but not the activity of the EGFR/kinase ERK/MAPK , as well as Akt [ ] . ROS that are produced by <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and nocodazole , both of which disrupt microtubules , have also been reported to promote Y845 phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells , R22 , by which ERK/MAPK signaling is triggered to activate plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) expression [ ] .	122	26	87	None

Further differentiation of iPSC derived definitive endoderm cells within transwell plates , by addition of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , produced layers of cells with developing spheroid structures at Stage 2 in many of the iPSC lines ( Figure , top row ) . CDX2 expression at Stage 2 was relatively uniform within layers of cells differentiating in transwells ( Figure , bottom row ) . However , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> showed more intense expression around spheroid structures .	19 20	15 16 17	70	None
Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity is another important anticancer mechanism induced by cetuximab in various cell lines ( ; ) and this MAb effectively induced ADCC in A431 and Caski cells , whereas no ADCC was observed in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cell line . Based on these findings we conclude that cell surface EGFR expression is very relevant for cetuximab induction of ADCC , but not as much for inhibiting VEGF secretion and cell proliferation , demonstrating that cetuximab can modulate multiple crucial pathways of CC cell lines in different ways . In summary , our data suggested that the combination of cetuximab with cisplatin/ RxT , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors could be useful for CC treatment , independently of EGFR expression status .	106	109	39	None
PI3K mutation and/or loss of PTEN have been shown to contribute to maintained activation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and are associated with innate resistance to trastuzumab [ ] and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .

In phase II clinical trials , nilotinib proved safe and effective for long-term use in CML patients who were intolerant of or resistant to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . Although successful hematologic and cytogenetic responses have been obtained in the vast majority of nilotinib treated patients , cases showing resistance to nilotinib have been observed [ , ] . Several causes of nilotinib resistance have been described : <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 [ - ] , overexpression of BCR-ABL1 itself or overexpression of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) or the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase [ ] and down-regulation of apoptotic BAX and CERS1 ( ceramide synthase 1 ) [ ] .	24	93	67	None

As aforementioned , the RMSD values of the ligand in R28C and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants were greater than 4 , which was two times larger than that of wild type . It is clear that the neutral charged cysteine has a sulfur atom in its side chain , which imposes a larger steric restriction compared with arginine . Although it has the same positive charge as arginine , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> has a five-member ring that produces more steric hindrance than the side chain of arginine .	67	12	12	None
Likewise , alteration of a mCRY2 residue in the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> pocket also compromised complex association ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , , ) . These results pinpoint the Fbxl3 C-terminal tail as a “hotspot” of the interface and suggest a possible antagonistic role of FAD in regulating Fbxl3-mCRY2 interaction . Our mutagenesis analysis also established the Fbxl3 <ANNO_TYPE_gene> subdomain as a second critical docking site for mCRY2 .	9	54	16	None
Hence we hypothesized that the constitutive activation of the EGFR/RAS/BRAF pathway could be responsible for the lack of sensitivity of FO-1 cells to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and therefore treated them with both NAC and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , a specific inhibitor of BRAF <ANNO_TYPE_variant> .	32	23	39	None

Recent studies demonstrated that TGS is associated with biochemical modification of critical residues in the histone tails and silent-state chromatin marks , not only at the target promoter region but also at the downstream region , which in turn is associated with repressive chromatin structures , , , . The protein components responsible for TGS were partially identified and found to contain Ago proteins , DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) , DNMT1 , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ( HDAC1 ) , , , , , .	60 61	163 164	64 65	None

The <ANNO_TYPE_variant> resistance mutation was modelled in the 3FQQ dimer and , while some of the possible <ANNO_TYPE_drug> side-chain conformations did not impact on the binding of BMS-790052 , other conformations of the histidine side-chain prevented BMS-790052 from binding as deeply into the cleft compared to wild type NS5A ( as illustrated in ) . In the 1ZH1 NS5A dimer model Y93H is flanked on either side by T56 and G33 ( both from the same NS5A monomer as Y93H ) , and an interaction between Y93H and T56 should not impact on the binding of BMS-790052 . For genotype 1b ( con1 ) , the common L31V resistance mutation confers 23-fold resistance against BMS-790052 in replicon assays , whereas in the MST in vitro assay there was no detectable binding of the inhibitor to the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> NS5A26–20 mutant .	17	136	1	None

Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of everolimus . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	126	39	123	None

Predicted to be of particular importance was the inclination of the C-terminal section of helix H4 , which brought residues 112 , 116 and 120 closer to the GSH <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . These residues also helped to form a pocket ‘cap’ for the putative DDT binding site , which would potentially increase hydrophobicity and therefore affinity for the highly hydrophobic <ANNO_TYPE_gene> molecule . Our study focused upon two residue exchanges , <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and F120L , which are located in the C-terminal section of helix H4 and , thus , have the potential to influence DDT binding .	29	59	70	None
In addition , bosutinib ( SKI-606 ) was developed , a second line inhibitor which has the broadest target spectrum inhibiting SRC , ABL and TEC , as well as serine kinases CAMK2G and STE20 , but <ANNO_TYPE_drug> does not target PDGFR and KIT [ , ] .

It could be that the simultaneous silencing of PI3KCA and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> leads to a greater activation of Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway , but this phenomenon needs to be clarified . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells are less sensitive to BCNU and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than U87-MG cells [ ] .	36	10	28	None
Prior work provided evidence that CCR1 and cinnamyl <ANNO_TYPE_drug> dehydrogenase ( CAD ) may organize into a functional complex through which the substrate coniferyl aldehyde is transferred from <ANNO_TYPE_gene> to CAD without much leakage , thereby acting as a channel leading specifically to the synthesis of G lignin . Similarly , caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and ferulate 5-hydroxylase ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) were suggested to form an analogous complex contributing specifically to the synthesis of S lignin .	8	28	59	None

Although the resistant cell line <ANNO_TYPE_gene> does not have the EGFR <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , it was found to have MET amplification . MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is associated with the development of various human cancers . Therefore , EGFR-TKIs fail to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway dependent growth signal because the constitutive phosphorylation of HER3 by MET occurs independent of EGFR activation , which causes the cells to acquire resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> .	80	5	11	None
Such discrepancy can be explained by the difference in the nature of the substituted amino-acid ( cysteine in one case and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in the other ) or by differences in experimental conditions ( whole-cell configuration on oocytes and giant-patch configuration on COS-7 cells , respectively ) . Furthermore , Matavel et al. showed that <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and R243C mutants exhibited an impaired activation by both <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and PKC , whereas C-terminal KCNQ1 mutants presented an increased activation .	21	64	54	None
mTORC1 controls cell growth and translation through the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4EBP1 , which regulate either the translation of ribosomal proteins or the cap dependent translation by inhibition of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E , respectively. , The activated mTOR pathway has been identified in several human malignancies , thus being an attractive target for anticancer therapy . <ANNO_TYPE_gene> activity is inhibited by rapalogs such as rapamycin ( sirolimus ) and associated analogs ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , RAD001 , ridaforolimus/AP23573 ) .	84	68	14	None

Ubiquitous CreERT2 expression is provided by a knock-in insertion of the CreERT2 cDNA into the 3′ UTR of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene , which yields viable homozygotes with no obvious phenotype .	42	66 67 68	19	None
Several studies have reported renal failure and tumor lysis syndrome during TKI based molecular targeted therapies , including with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma , with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> for chronic myelogenous leukemia , and with flavopiridol for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.– Because the Q141K variant of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> corresponding to SNP 421C&gt ; A reduces uric acid transport and those TKIs are substrates/inhibitors of ABCG2/BCRP , TKI therapy in patients with the SNP 421C&gt ; A ( Q141K ) may be at higher risk of tumor lysis syndrome . A defect in the pharmacological interaction has been suggested between sunitinib and another ABCG2/BCRP germ-line mutant allele , 1291T & gt ; C. Remarkably , sunitinib reversed wild-type ABCG2/BCRP mediated drug resistance and competitively inhibited ABCG2/BCRP mediated estrone 3-sulfate transport and the binding of 125I-iodoarylazidoprazosin to ABCG2/BCRP .

Acrosome reaction experiments indicate that the basic problem in sperm from hyh mice is a reduced capacity to undergo exocytosis upon stimulation with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and even with a calcium ionophore . The fact that exogenous αSNAP can rescue acrosomal exocytosis in these cells is a strong evidence that the principal defect is a malfunction in the endogenous protein . Worth noticing is that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation is in a region of αSNAP that does not interact with the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	23	78 79	64	None

In conclusion , the combination of bortezomib and mitotic inhibitors such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , docetaxel , vincristine or BI 2536 is an effective strategy for targeting of both TKIs -resistant and -sensitive Bcr-Abl positive leukemic cells .

A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when <ANNO_TYPE_gene> amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( T790M ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( T315I ) following <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Although the MET <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation renders cancers insensitive to type I MET inhibitors , conformal differences between these and type II compounds may allow treatment of MET Y1230H mutant cancers or prevent the emergence of resistance due to the mutation. ,	71	14	76	None

For the first cycle , a total of 85 mg ( 40 mg/m2 ) of liposomal <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in 250 ml of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( 5 % glucose solution ) was prescribed with the same premedications used for the prior carboplatin .	49	4	54	None
Effects of a selective GPCR agonist or antagonist on the growth of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> H1975 cells An adenosine A2a receptor ( CGS-21680 ) , an angiotensin II receptor-like 1 agonist ( angiotensin II ) and a purinergic receptor <ANNO_TYPE_variant> G-protein coupled 2 agonist ( 2- ( methylthio ) adenosine 5′-triphosphate tetrasodium salt hydrate ) , which were all agonists of up-regulated GPCRs in the microarray list , had no effect on tumor cell growth . Similarly , cell growth was not affected by a <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> agonist ( beraprost sodium ) , a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B agonist ( BW723C86 ) and an arginine vasopressin receptor 1A agonist ( [ Arg8 ] -vasopressin acetate salt ) , which were all classified as “down regulated GPCRs” .	12	83 84 85 86	37	None
Further in vitro studies on immature human CD34+ cells demonstrated that S1P1 upregulation decreases their chemotactic activity towards SDF-1 due to reduced cell surface expression of CXCR4 suggesting a potential interaction between <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and SDF-1 [ ] . These observations were recently corroborated by Golan et al. showing that short-term inhibition of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> axis during steady state conditions or during CXCR4 inhibition ( via <ANNO_TYPE_drug> administration ) caused reduction of SDF-1 in the plasma [ ] .	64	52	32	None

Inhibition of these dually specific threonine/tyrosine kinases leads to down-regulation of the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signalling pathway . In a phase III open-label clinical trial ( METRIC ) [ ] trametinib was shown to significantly improve rates of progression-free and overall survival compared with chemotherapy with dacarbazine or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 6 month overall survival of 81 % and 67 % respectively , patient crossover included , p = 0.01 ) , in patients with <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or V600K BRAF mutation positive metastatic melanoma .	46	12	72	None

<ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutation analysis was positive for a <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in codon 13 of the KRAS gene . Chemotherapy with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 to 14 , oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day 1 , and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg on day 1 of a 21-day cycle was initiated , as was treatment with zoledronic acid every 28 days .	19	0	7	None
The results indicated that relative to wild-type BCRP expressing cells , the IC50 value of SN38 against <ANNO_TYPE_variant> expressing Flp-ln-293 cells was reduced approximately 50 % , but it was not reduced in V12M expressing cells . Interestingly , the IC50 values of SN38 , mitoxantrone , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , daunorubicin , and etoposide for Flp-ln-293 cells expressing other variants were significantly lower than those for cells expressing wild-type <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	47	68	17	None
Again , the activity of this resistance mechanism could be suppressed through combined MET and BRAF or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibition . Further evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy in overcoming resistance is demonstrated by NSCLC cell lines resistant to erlotinib and the MET inhibitor SU11274 , which display upregulation of both mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and Wnt pathway components and restoration of sensitivity to EGFR/MET inhibition by the addition of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . A final mechanism of resistance in gastric cancer cell lines has been demonstrated when MET amplified SNU6838 gastric cancer cell lines were treated with the MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF2341066 ; a novel mutation occurred in the activation loop of MET , causing a conformal change that blocked inhibitor binding analogous to the gatekeeper mutations seen in EGFR ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) following erlotinib treatment and in ABL ( T315I ) following imatinib .	73	17	134	None
Since no significant changes in growth inhibition with concurrent inhibitors treatment were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells ( ) , drug effects on the activity of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and PI3K signaling pathways were assessed in the remaining three cell lines : MCF-7 , T47D and SKBr3 ( ) . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 1 nM ) with or without trametinib was observed to up-regulate p-AKT and markedly reduce p-rpS6 in MCF-7 and SKBr3 cells ( ) , and reduce p-p70S6K in MCF-7 cells ( ) . For NVP-BEZ235 , increased p-AKT was observed in SKBr3 cells alone or in combination with trametinib , while GSK2126458 , with or without trametinib , reduced p-AKT in the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and SKBr3 cell lines .	47	25	111	None
T674I <ANNO_TYPE_gene> is a “gatekeeper” mutation : substitution of the gatekeeper threonine ( T674 ) with a bulky amino acid ( I ) blocks access by imatinib and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , such as nilotinib <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , to a hydrophobic pocket inside the ATP binding site [ ] . This gatekeeper mutation is analogous to the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation in Bcr-Abl [ , ,, ] .	39 40	1	61	None
Antrodia camphorata solid-state cultured mycelium ( AC-SS , 1 μg ml−1 ) showed adjuvant anti-proliferative effects with cisplatin ( 10 μM ) <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( 10 μM ) in hepatoma cell <ANNO_TYPE_variant> C3A and PLC/PRF/5 cells ( in vitro ) and , on xenografted cells in tumor implanted nude mice ( in vivo ) . Furthermore , AC-SS showed its adjuvant effects through the inhibition of MDR gene expressions and the pathway of COX-2 dependent inhibition of AKT phosphorylation [ ] . In terms of the very recent literature , Lu et al. [ ] noted that ethanol extract from wild fruiting bodies of A. camphorata ( EEAC ) dose-dependently induced human premyelocytic leukemia HL 60 cells apoptosis via histone hypoacetylation , upregulation of histone deacetyltransferase 1 (HDAC 1) , and downregulation of histone acetyltransferase activities including <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , CBP and PCAF .	22 23	137 138	31	None
It would be interesting to study in the future if <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , CTBP , MECP2 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> or other yet-to-be identified REST interactors are involved .

To explore potential <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance mechanisms in model EC039 , we screened for mutations in a panel of genes ( EGFR , K-ras , B-raf and PIK3CA ) across all 5 PDECX models and their corresponding patient EC tissues . Screened gene locations included ; exons 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 of EGFR gene , exons 2 and 3 of K-ras gene , exons 11 and 15 of B-raf gene , and exons 9 and 20 of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> gene .

In this case , because HBeAg was detected and HBV DNA was still high 3 months after administration of clevudin , it should be clarified that the mutations in the overlapping frame gene regions , S codon L213I ( P codons P221T and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) , may be associated with escape mutation as well as drug resistance . An interesting point of this case concerns the sustained HCV suppression , which occurred even with insufficient treatment of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> .	77	77	43	None

This scenario could explain the seemingly contradictory report by others who found the H1975 cell line to be highly sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] ; our H1975 cells could represent a subclone that emerged over time . Analysis of earlier passages of H1975 cells for the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation would be informative in this regard .

Cyclin D1 binds to CDK4 and CDK6 to form a complex , supporting <ANNO_TYPE_variant> transition [ ] . Kastl et al. reported that reduced cyclin D1 expression modulated by miR-34a could induce G1 phase arrest , where docetaxel exerts little cytotoxicity , in turn leading to the resistance of docetaxel in breast cancer cells [ ] . Cyclin D1 is also a target of let-7i , and a chimera that combines Mucin 1 (MUC1) aptamer and let-7i miRNA was proved to reverse <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance in EOC cells through down-regulation of cyclin D1 , cyclin D2 , Dicer 1 , and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> expressions [ ] .	82	100	13	None

To investigate cell-specific EGFR signaling dynamics , we constructed an H1299WT model ( WT model ) , an H1299EGFR-WT model ( EGFR-WT model ) , and two alternate H1299L858R models ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> model A with Mig6 overexpression and L858R model B with Cbl overexpression ) .	6	45	90	None
Overexpression of wild type EGFR induced high and sustained phosphorylation of EGFR , Shc , MEK ( mitogen activated protein kinase kinase ) and ERK ( extracellular signal regulated kinase ) , while the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation reduced these response levels . In addition , H1299L858R , which is supposed to be more sensitive to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> than H1299EGFR-WT , was effectively inhibited by gefitinib administration at the downstream part of the signaling pathway ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and ERK ) compared with H1299EGFR-WT , but , surprisingly , not at the upstream part of the pathway ( EGFR and Shc ) .	54	73	34	None

It has been shown that decreasing the expression of rat IRAS or <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells could attenuate the activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase ( ERK ) or reduce the radioligand binding to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , which further supported that hIRAS or Nischarin might serve as I1R itself , or at least a functional subunit of I1R [ ] .

BCRP mRNA expression was higher in hepatic metastases in patients treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> based chemotherapy than in patients with irinotecan-naïve metastases , suggesting that <ANNO_TYPE_gene> is also involved in irinotecan resistance in vivo . Mutations of BCRP gene produce varied substrate profiles for mutants as well as wild-type variants . Mutations at codon 482 in BCRP mRNA involving the replacement of arginine with threonine or glycine ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> or R482G ) caused higher resistance to anthracyclines , .	12	24	67	None

There is some evidence that in pilocytic astrocytomas , the fusion protein is associated with a favorable outcome ( Hawkins et al. , ) , while another series did not find any correlation with the BRAF fusion protein and disease progression ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> et al. , ) . The prevalence of oncogenic BRAF V600E mutations in several solid tumors has led to the development of anti-cancer agents that specifically inhibit BRAF V600E . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or vemurafenib ( F.

Antrodia camphorata solid-state cultured mycelium ( AC-SS , 1 μg ml−1 ) showed adjuvant anti-proliferative effects with cisplatin ( 10 μM ) or mitomycin ( 10 μM ) in hepatoma cell <ANNO_TYPE_variant> C3A and PLC/PRF/5 cells ( in vitro ) and , on xenografted cells in tumor implanted nude mice ( in vivo ) . Furthermore , AC-SS showed its adjuvant effects through the inhibition of MDR gene expressions and the pathway of COX-2 dependent inhibition of AKT phosphorylation [ ] . In terms of the very recent literature , Lu et al. [ ] noted that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> extract from wild fruiting bodies of A. camphorata ( EEAC ) dose-dependently induced human premyelocytic leukemia HL 60 cells apoptosis via histone hypoacetylation , upregulation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , and downregulation of histone acetyltransferase activities including GCN 5 , CBP and PCAF .	97	124 125 126 127 128	31	None

However , acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs is inevitable due to various mechanisms , such as <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , c-Met amplification , activation of alternative pathways ( IGF-1 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , PI3CA , AXL [ ] ) , transformation to mesenchymal cells [ ] or small cell features [ ] , and tumor heterogeneity [ ] . A randomized trial comparing the irreversible ErbB-family blocker <ANNO_TYPE_drug> versus placebo in patients with NSCLC after prior EGFR-TKI exposure failed to prove a benefit of overall survival [ ] .	63	27	15	None

Jin et al also reported that the HDAC inhibitor , <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , inhibits HDAC activity by downregulating cyclin D1 protein expression in colonic carcinoma cells in xenografted mice . In conclusion , our study confirms that valproic acid significantly suppresses growth of Kasumi-1 cell xenograft tumors in nude mice via cell cycle arrest . The antitumor activity of valproic acid is possibly attributable to its direct downregulation of cyclin D1 , CDK4/6 , and cyclin E1 expression , blockage of Rb phosphorylation , reduction of free <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , inhibition of HDAC activity , attenuation of histone acetylation in the p21 promoter region , upregulation of p21 expression , and induction of cell cycle arrest .	10	86	86	None

In addition , they showed that two dominant activating mutations in the PI3K catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PI3K-CA ) , E545K and H1047R , which are prevalent in breast cancer , also confer resistance to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] . Conversely , Li et al. infected cells with lentiviruses expressing either wild-type kinases ( Src , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> Lyn , EGFR and others ) or kinase alleles with gatekeeper mutations . Through this approach , they showed that Src Family Kinases (SFKs) , as well as EGFR , are relevant targets for the Src inhibitor dasatinib and that acquired <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations render cells resistant not only to erlotinib and gefitinib , but also to dasatinib [ ] .	36	56	98	None
Neratinib ( <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) , one of the three agents investigated , has n't shown good RR when tested on patients with known <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , therefore further development of this drug in lung cancer has been halted . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( BIBW2992 ) is being investigated as part of the LUX-Lung program which aims to evaluate the use of TKI in second- or third-line treatment in patients who have acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib ( LUX-Lung 1 , 4 and 5 ) as well as the use of TKIs as a first-line treatment in patients with EGFR activating mutations ( LUX-Lung 2 , 3 and 6 ) .	39	2	23	None

Another possibility is that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> BRAFV600E mutants have alternative signaling at the level of Raf , as has been described for cell lines with acquired resistance to a different Raf-inhibitor , AZ628 , which show increased signaling through C-Raf [ ] . The increase in pErk in an NRAS <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant cell line could be explained by abrogation of negative feedback loops mediated mainly by dual specificity phosphatases ( MKPs/DUSPs ) , as reported with <ANNO_TYPE_gene> inhibitors [ , ] , and the recent description of increased C-Raf signaling when heterodimerizing with inhibited B-Raf in BRAF wild type cells [ , ] .	4	75	49	None
As a molecular chaperone for proteins involved in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , HGF , and EML4/ALK fusion , the inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is also being considered as a target for compensatory pathway inhibition and has fueled combination therapies in both EGFR-TKI and ALK inhibitor-resistant disease . In the advanced NSCLC EGFR-TKI resistant setting , the HSP90 small molecule inhibitor AUY922 is being evaluated as monotherapy in a phase II clinical trial vs. pemetrexed or <ANNO_TYPE_drug> in patients with tumors with activating EGFR mutations ( www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT016461250 ) . This agent is also being assessed in a phase II trial in patients with de novo resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations not previously treated with EGFR-TKIs ( www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT01854034 ) and in patients with EGFR mutations and/or EGFR-TKI resistant disease , as part of a phase II cluster study in Chinese patients evaluating five novel inhibitors of HSP90 , PI3K , ALK , MET , and MEK ( ) .	76	8	108	None

In the Y67R variant , the mutation from Tyr67 to <ANNO_TYPE_gene> may produce not only a distal arginine ( although its structure is not available ) , but also a room for substrate coordination ( because Fe-S bond is broken in the Y67R variant ) . Our current NMR structure of the Y67H variant ( determined at pH 7.0 ) suggests that the sixth ligation bond Fe-S is attenuated due to the disruption of hydrogen bond between Met80 and Tyr67 existed in the native cyt c . The distance between Nε atom of His67 and heme ferric iron is measured as 5.48 Å in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> variant , very close to the distances of 5.84 Å and 5.55 Å between Nε2 atom of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and heme iron ion in horseradish peroxidase ( HRP , pdb codes 1H5A ) and cytochrome c peroxidase ( CcP , pdb codes 2CYP ) , , respectively .	124 125	10	104 105	None
The results summarized in Table show that MNF , an AhR antagonist , is indeed a powerful agent suppressing the rate of cell proliferation in P20E cells both in the presence and the absence of exogenous <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . In addition , the anti-inflammatory agent parthenolide was also quite effective in suppressing proliferation . <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which has both AhR antagonist [ , ] and anti-inflammatory properties [ ] , was the most effective in proliferation suppression particularly in <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells .	54	36 37	79	None
Although a retrospective study and the PICCOLO ( <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , Irinotecan and Ciclosporin in Colorectal Cancer Therapy ) trial have demonstrated a reduced response to cetuximab and panitumumab for patients with NRAS mutations , , further work is required to demonstrate the predictive capacity of these mutations . The serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf is an effector in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> signaling pathway , downstream of K-Ras . Mutations in the proto-oncogene BRAF are present in 5 % –10 % of the metastatic CRC population and are also mutually exclusive of KRAS mutations . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is the most common of all BRAF mutations ( present in 90 % of cases ) , and is enriched in a subset of patients who are female , greater than 70 years of age , with KRAS WT right sided colon cancer .	8	57	91 92	None
EGFR gene mutations indicate sensitivity to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , and it was demonstrated that about 85 % of patients with NSCLC who obtained benefit from gefitinib treatment were found to have mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene [ - ] . EGFR mutations in exon 19 ( short in-frame deletions ) or 21 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( point mutation ) affect the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain leading to the activation of 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds , which function to compete with ATP [ ] . Anti-EGFR therapy can consequently lead to the downregulation of downstream signaling cascades , such as the PI3K/Akt , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , MAPK , and STAT pathways , responsible for cell proliferation and survival , resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis , respectively .	6	114	61	None
This <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and has been shown to play a critical role in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( RIG-I ) gene signaling , acting as a sensor of RNA virus infection [ ] . In fact , many elements of the regulatory pathways governing both the RIG-I pathway and IFN gene expression are themselves regulated by IFN . In turn , IFN may coordinate the upregulation of antiviral factors , as revealed by the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , A3F , TRIM , tetherin and MxA mRNA expression levels in paired maternal blood and CB samples .	18 19	1 2	77	None

The effect of this is a regulation of mTORC 1 and a consecutive up regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein ( 4E-BP1 ) and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . The phosphorylation of these proteins eventually leads to increased levels of several proteins that are important in cellular proliferation , migration and angiogenesis in RPE and vascular endothelial cells – , being crucial cellular features in the pathogenesis of retinal vascular diseases such as neovascular AMD or proliferative DR . In our experiments , a significant dose dependent effect on RPE cells as well as on HUVECs was seen in terms of inhibiting proliferation ( ) as well as migration ( ) after treatment with three different concentrations of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , suggesting that a significant reduction of these properties can be reached by directly targeting mTOR without specifically blocking <ANNO_TYPE_gene> or other involved cytokines .	121	141	30	None
To further investigate the association between LKB1 and gemcitabine , and as gemcitabine inhibited DNA synthesis and caused DNA damage , the extent of DNA damage was evaluated in LKB1 transfected , mock transfected and wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells following exposure to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . γH2AX is a generally accepted sensitive marker of DNA damage , and in particular DSBs . γH2AX is the phosphorylated form of H2AX , a member of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family .	41	71	70 71	None

In contrast to the G268V mutant , modelling studies do not give us clear insight as to the structural basis for the HSAN1 phenotype in the V246M or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutants . These mutations appear to be more subtle .

<ANNO_TYPE_variant> has been reported to sensitize multidrug resistant tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs without any associated toxicity [ ] . FoxM1 is an oncogenic <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in aggressive human breast cancers [ , ] and we have recently showed that targeting FoxM1 by DIM enhances sensitivity of breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as <ANNO_TYPE_drug> [ ] .	54	23 24	0	None
Finally , we didn’t adjust the other confounding factors , such as diet <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> consumption and cigarette smoking , as these may bias the association between uric acid associated genes <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , glucose metabolism and insulin secretion . We analysed the effects of the SNPs from eleven uric acid associated loci on the risk of T2D , glucose metabolism and insulin secretion and showed that GCKR rs780094 and SF1 rs606458 variants have an impact on the risk of T2D and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , SLC22A11 and SLC22A12 play roles in regulating glucose metabolism and insulin secretion in Chinese males as well as ABCG2 , SLC17A1 and LRP2 in Chinese females .	13 14	82	31 32	None
The emergence of the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> EGFR gatekeeper mutation and up-regulation of downstream signaling by MET amplification have been described as the two main mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance . However a phase III trial enrolling only patients with MET positive tumors was stopped in early March 2014 due to futility ; there was no evidence to suggest a positive effect of addition of onartuzumab to <ANNO_TYPE_drug> . Other mechanisms include EGFR amplifications , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mutations or a transition from epithelial to mesenchymal differentiation .	65	73	4	None

Erlotinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> belong to the first generation of TKIs and have reversible binding features . The principal predictive factor for response to such drugs is the presence of somatic “activating” mutations in the EGFR gene that cause an aberrant and constitutive activation of the receptor at the membrane level , resulting in a growth advantage of tumor cells through the activation of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , PI3K/Akt , and STAT signaling pathways . In about 50 % of cases , a secondary mutation ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) is supposed to be responsible for resistance. , Other mechanisms involve MET gene amplification ( 5 % –20 % ) ,	2	63	83	None

Consistent with this model , microtubule regrowth analysis revealed that an enhancement of microtubule nucleation/regrowth occurs in DNA-PKcs-deficient cells and that such dysregulation can be corrected by expression of the phosphomimetic Chk2 <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutant ( and ) . It is likely that , in the absence of DNA-PKcs , inadequate activation of the Chk2–Brca1 signaling pathway leads to excessive microtubule nucleation and aberrant <ANNO_TYPE_gene> attachment .

The two main neurotransmitters eliciting contraction in human and rodent urinary bladder are adenosine triphosphate and acetylcholine , which act on a ligand gated ion channel ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> receptor ) and two G-protein coupled receptors ( M2 and M3 muscarinic ) , respectively ( de Groat and Yoshimura ) . A common approach for studying how the functions of these receptors change in diabetes mellitus is to examine their contractile roles in isolated urinary bladder from animals treated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> (STZ) . In smooth muscle , cAMP mediates relaxation , and activation of the M2 receptor inhibits <ANNO_TYPE_gene> <ANNO_TYPE_gene> and the relaxation elicited by forskolin and activation of β-adrenoceptors in gastrointestinal and urinary bladder smooth muscle ( Ehlert ) .	79	97 98	27	None

In summary , we have discovered that tolerogenic DC engineered ex vivo for low co-stimulation ability increase frequency and numbers of IL-10 expressing B-cells in vitro and in vivo , consequent to concomitant proliferation of pre existing IL-10+ B-cells and conversion of CD19+ B-lymphcytes into <ANNO_TYPE_gene> expressing cells without affecting their immunosuppressive potential in vitro . We also discovered that these DC-sensitive putative Bregs expressed receptors for <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> which is produced by the tolerogenic dendritic cells . Taken together , our findings usher a potential new therapeutic approach to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> immunotherapy which involves suppresisve B-cells , possibly homogeneous Bregs , together with approaches and molecules that stabilise their suppressive ability and expand their numbers in vitro ( e.g. RA , IL-10 , IL-21 ) .	67 68	45	90	None

Consistent with these results , p53 restoration resulted in an 8-fold increase of caspase-3/7 activity after etoposide treatment , whereas the activity was increased regardless of p53 function after <ANNO_TYPE_drug> treatment ( Figure ) . These results demonstrate that both caspase-8 and p53 functions are critical for etoposide induced caspase-9 activation , and also the subsequent cleavage of procaspase-3 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in HOC313 cells . To confirm the requirement of caspase-8 activity in the etoposide induced apoptosis , HOC313 cells were transiently transfected with the empty vector , wild-type ( WT ) , or <ANNO_TYPE_variant> inactive mutant of Flag tagged caspase-8 by electroporation , then treated with etoposide at 32.5°C .	29	60	94	None

Most surprisingly , we demonstrate that the epistatic interactions between mutants of unc-18 and rab-3 are distinct depending on the phenotypic context such that the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation acts downstream of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> in exocytosis whereas it acts upstream of Rab3 in <ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity .	40	30	25	None
Based on our data , we hypothesized that PRR of hnRNP L binds to PTB and cooperatively suppresses inclusion of exon <ANNO_TYPE_variant> . We thus examined the role of PRR of hnRNP L on the interaction with PTB . Histidine tagged hnRNP L ( His-L ) , its <ANNO_TYPE_gene> deleted variant ( His-L-ΔPRR ) , histidine tagged hnRNP LL ( His-LL ) , and its PRR inserted variant ( His-LL-PRR ) were expressed in SH-SY5Y cells , and they were immunoprecipitated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> antibody in the presence of RNase .	82	48	21	None

Two secondary mutations of ALK associated with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> resistance – L1196M <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> – were first detected in the same patient , who relapsed after achieving a partial response to the drug . The L1196M substitution occurs at the gatekeeper position of ALK ( a position that controls the binding of nucleotides and TKIs ) , and corresponds to the T790M substitution in EGFR and the T315I substitution in the <ANNO_TYPE_gene> fusion protein , both of which confer resistance to corresponding TKIs .	7	70	11 12	None
First , immediately N-terminal to the SET domain , a unique CXC domain , coordinated by 2 clusters of three zinc ions , differentiates <ANNO_TYPE_gene> from other SET-domain PMT structures ( no structural homolog of the CXC domains was found by the DALI server [ ] ) . Missense mutations at residues coordinating the first and second zinc of the CXC domain were reported in acute myeloid leukemia ( H525N ) and myelodysplastic syndrome ( <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) suggesting that disruption of the CXC domain can be associated with specific cancer types [ , ] . Second , the conformation of the first five residues of the post-SET domain diverges drastically from previous structures of active SET-domain methyltransferases , and folds in a direction diametrically opposite to its expected position , where it would otherwise contribute to formation of the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> binding site ( and ) .	139	24	75	None
SPC-A1 cells overexpressing HMGB1 showed no distinct change in the level of phosphor-Akt ( Ser473 ) , phosphor-mTOR ( Ser2448 ) , phosphor-S6RP ( Additional file : Figure S4A ) , nor did the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> SPC-A1/DTX cells transfected with HMGB1 shRNA ( Additional file : Figure S4B ) . Suppression of mTORC1 activity is considered as a crucial step in the initiation of autophagy [ ] . Additionally , rapamycin , a specific inhibitor of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> [ ] , enhanced the accumulation of LC3-II in SPC-A1 cells transfected with the control vector but not in cells transfected with HMGB1 shRNA ( Additional file : Figure <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ) .	34	75	105	None
Given that several aspects of <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ( P4 ) signaling are differentially influenced by PR isoforms , PRA/PRB ratio should be considered as an important determinant of functional consequences of P4 signaling . We have recently reported a major role of p38 and <ANNO_TYPE_gene> mitogen activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) in regulating PRA/PRB expression ratio at post-translational level that might influence P4 signaling in PR expressing cells . Most of previous studies – on transcriptional regulation by PR isoforms were conducted <ANNO_TYPE_variant> <ANNO_TYPE_variant> cells ( ER+ ) expressing either PRA or PRB where PR homodimers are the only molecular species or in separate cell lines expressing each PR isoform .	5	43	82 83	None

In contrast , no significant changes in the phosphorylation of CENP-A were observed in tumour tissues from mice treated with paclitaxel , suggesting that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> may interfere with the affinity of BubR1 for kinetocores , thus perturbing the mitotic spindle checkpoint induced by paclitaxel . <ANNO_TYPE_variant> is involved in DNA replication , DNA repair and mitosis , suggesting <ANNO_TYPE_gene> affects cell cycle progression both at S-phase and during mitosis .	24	58	45	None
Global induction of apoptosis with <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , cycloheximide or puromycin was shown to lead to a loss of cell coupling , probably due to caspase-3 mediated degradation of Cx43 , in primary bovine lens epithelial and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts [ ] . Interestingly , we previously demonstrated that Stat3 inhibition in cells transformed by Src or the Large Tumor antigen of Simian Virus 40 leads to apoptosis [ , ] , possibly due to activation of the transcription factor <ANNO_TYPE_variant> family , potent apoptosis inducers , by these oncogenes .	5	79	79	None

We detected increased γ-H2AX phosphorylation at 2 , 3 and 6 days after injecting 60 <ANNO_TYPE_drug> <ANNO_TYPE_drug> body weight ( a single injection was given on days 1 , 2 and 3 ) , indicating activation of a DNA damage response ( ) that coincided with the induction of apoptosis .	52 53	13 14 15 16 17	32	None
Similarly , we also found that GTE could increase the chemotherapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs against other HER2 overexpressing cancer cell lines , for example , MDA-MB-453/HER2 ( Supplementary Figures <ANNO_TYPE_variant> and S3B ) . These findings suggest that GTE can chemosensitize HER2 overexpressing cancer cells to anticancer drugs ( e.g. , taxol and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> ) .	54	30	30	None
The second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors , dasatinib and nilotinib , can circumvent most mutations that confer resistance to imatinib ; the <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutation , however , causes resistance to all <ANNO_TYPE_gene> kinase inhibitors developed so far . Similarly , the T790M point mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) confers resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and <ANNO_TYPE_drug> , which are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer .	59	29	20	None
In the advanced NSCLC EGFR-TKI resistant setting , the HSP90 small molecule inhibitor AUY922 is being evaluated as monotherapy in a phase II clinical trial vs. <ANNO_TYPE_drug> or docetaxel in patients with tumors with activating EGFR mutations ( www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT016461250 ) . This agent is also being assessed in a phase II trial in patients with de novo resistant <ANNO_TYPE_variant> mutations not previously treated with EGFR-TKIs ( www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT01854034 ) and in patients with EGFR mutations and/or EGFR-TKI resistant disease , as part of a phase II cluster study in Chinese patients evaluating five novel inhibitors of HSP90 , <ANNO_TYPE_gene> , ALK , MET , and MEK ( ) .	26	101	60	None
The results of these mutations in the lof rab-3 genetic background , however , argue against the simple interpretation that the effects are solely the result of the same <ANNO_TYPE_gene> interaction .

<ANNO_TYPE_drug> sensitivity phenotypes of single point mutations in unc-18 We recently demonstrated that a single point mutation ( D216N ) in Munc18 acts biochemically by reducing binding to the assembled SNARE complex and that the orthologous mutation in C. elegans unc-18 ( D214N ) reduces sensitivity to both low and high concentrations of exogenous ethanol [ ] . Previously , we have biochemically characterised other point mutations in Munc18 that affect binding to other proteins including R39C ( inhibits binding to closed-conformation <ANNO_TYPE_gene> ) [ , ] , P242S ( inhibits binding to Mint proteins ) [ ] and <ANNO_TYPE_variant> ( enhances binding to Rab3 ) [ ] .	0	82	99	None
Consequently the <ANNO_TYPE_drug> phenotype of <ANNO_TYPE_variant> alternatively could be a secondary consequence of the reduction in <ANNO_TYPE_gene> binding in favour of Rab3 .	2	16	5	None

It is also reported that <ANNO_TYPE_drug> and nilotinib might be taken up in cells by different mechanisms , with the influx , intracellular concentrations of imatinib , and consequently patient sensitivity to imatinib depending upon the organic cation transporter ( OCT-1 ) , whereas nilotinib transport appears to be independent of <ANNO_TYPE_gene> . Both nilotinib and dasatinib efficiently block Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase catalytic activity by binding to distinct , partially overlapping sites in the kinase domain . Cross resistance with dasatinib is limited to <ANNO_TYPE_variant> , which is also the only mutant isolated at drug concentrations equivalent to maximal achievable plasma trough levels .	5	51	84	None
