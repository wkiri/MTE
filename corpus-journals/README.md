Source: The MSL ChemCam team maintains a 
[list of peer-reviewed publications by members of the science
team](http://www.msl-chemcam.com/index.php?menu=publications1&rubrique=63&contact_page=publications1#.WPT6cFP1AUE) . 

They are in reverse chronological order (most recent first).  Some
publications pre-date landing (e.g., describe the instrument design,
development, testing).  Post-landing results papers start with (I
think) #27.

Starting with #76, I have searched/downloaded through #69.
