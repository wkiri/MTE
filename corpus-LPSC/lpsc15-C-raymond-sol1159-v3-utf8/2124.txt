Sharp have shown the area is mineralogically and morphologically diverse [e.g. 1-5] (Fig. 1).  Here we combine Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM), High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE), and Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) derived thermal inertia (TI) orbital datasets to provide detailed, local context for the Curiosity Mars rover's ongoing in situ investigation. Datasets: A 25 cm/pixel color HiRISE mosaic provides high-spatial resolution morphologic coverage and spectral information (blue-green, red, and near-infrared color bands) of the lower flank of Mt. Sharp (Fig. 1). This mosaic was generated by orthorectificiation and georeferencing of 8 HiRISE color images, normalizing data from individual HiRISE detectors and images to one another, removing illumination effects due to regional slope across the image, and applying a uniform stretch piecewise across the scene [6, 7].  Elevation information at 1 m resolution is also available in DEMs generated from HiRISE stereo-pairs. CRISM visible/shortwave infrared data covering 544 wavelengths from ~0.4 - 4 Âµm provide additional hyperspectral coverage but at a lower spatial resolution.  We focus on standard 18 m/pixel full resolution targeted (FRT) CRISM observations in this work, and CRISM data collected in an along-track oversampled (ATO) manner that can be projected down to ~9 m/pixel are also available [8]. A 100 m/pixel TI mosaic was generated by selecting the best quality THEMIS observations of the region, and when necessary, shifting some values of adjacent images by a small offset (~10-30 TI units, approximately equivalent to the absolute TI uncertainty) to match overlapping regions and to remove residual seasonal temperature differences [7, 9]. All data products are georeferenced and coregistered with one another using a series of ground control points. CRISM mineralogy from endmember mapping: Techniques that have been used previously to detect the weak VNIR spectral features on lower Mt. Sharp include generating parameter maps to mathematically highlight subtle spectral changes,  ratioing spectra from areas of interest to spectrally bland (dusty) material, averaging 10s-100s of spectra over large spatial areas, and processing CRISM data with noise-filtering algorithms [2-4].   In this study, we build on previous work and use endmember mapping to highlight areas of mineralogical interest. We generated a library of scene-based spectral endmembers derived from regions within each CRISM observation (hematite, sulfates, clays, hydrated materials) that were identified in previously published work [2-4].  We then calculated the difference (Euclidean distance) between every spectrum in a scene and each endmember, normalizing all spectra to reduce effects of overall albedo variations and then focusing the comparison on wavelength regions where the CRISM detector has the best signal-to-noise. The resulting maps (e.g. Fig. 2a) highlight likely detections of these phases that are less noisy and more consistent between CRISM scenes as compared with standard CRISM parameter mapping. Iron-oxide correlation with long-distance in situ observations: We have compared areas in the CRISM observations that are spectrally similar to the hematiteridge with long-distance, visible wavelength ChemCam passive spectral observations of lower Mt. Sharp acquired by Curiosity on sol 467 [10] (Fig. 2b). Iron oxides in ChemCam data are indicated by greater band depths near 535 nm and steep fall-off >~747 nm; sometimes a weak absorption near 670 nm is also apparent (Fig. 2b, Line 1, spec. #9, 10, Line 2, spec. #10). These datasets are in good agreement with each other, demonstrating the ability to link ground-based and orbital datasets to direct Curiosity to stratigraphic units of discrete composition.  CRISM, HiRISE, and TI correlations: 2D scatterplots were generated to highlight regions with similar properties across the CRISM, HiRISE, and TI datasets.  Fig. 3 shows one such example that distinguishes five classes of materials.  Dark, basaltic sands in the dune fields have the lowest TI values (~285) in the scene and are associated with low 770:440 nm spectral slopes and deep absorptions at 1000 nm (red). Layers in the sulfate stack on Mount Sharp have similarly low TI values, but are spectrally distinct from the dunes based on their much higher 770:440 nm spectral slope and shallow 1000 nm absorptions (yellow). Much of the Murray formation has material that fall within into two clusters of TI values (~320, ~370; (green, blue respectively), and likely represent mixing between a clastic bedrock and basaltic sands originating from the Bagnold dune field. Regions that cluster near the lower TI values qualitatively correspond to bluer regions in   the HiRISE color mosaic (Fig. 1b), although there is a not a strong quantitative difference between the two in the CRISM parameter space. For this particular suite of THEMIS and CRISM parameters, Murray Formationlike materials are also found higher on Mt. Sharp near the Phyllosilicate Trough while the hematite ridge does not map distinctly. The highest thermal inertia values in the scene (~425) correspond to materials in a fanlike structure located at the end of a long channel (cyan). Conclusions and future work: The rich collection of morphologic, color, spectral, and thermophysical property data will continue to be examined to refine the definition of discrete geologic units within Mt. Sharp. Results from our continued analyses and comparisons of various orbital data sets will be incorporated into strategic plans for Curiosity drives and science targets.
