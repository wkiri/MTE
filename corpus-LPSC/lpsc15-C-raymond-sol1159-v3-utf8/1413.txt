Introduction: ChemCam is a Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument on-board the NASA Curiosity rover currently exploring Mars. ChemCam can analyze the chemical composition of geological samples without preparation and at a distance by detecting the light emission of constituting elements [1, 2]. ChemCam is sensitive to most chemical elements and can be used to detect and quantify a set of minor and trace elements such as Li, Sr, Ba, and  Rb using univariate and multivariate regression techniques [3]. Mn has also been detected and quantified with ChemCam at high concentrations indicating that highly oxidizing conditions must have occurred on the surface of Mars [4]. We report here the detection of high Zn content targets with ChemCam at the Kimberley location at Gale Crater that are linked to high-Mn concentrations.  Zn detection and quantification using LIBS: ChemCam was not initially designed to detect Zn which has a relatively high ionization energy of 9.39eV [5] higher than typical elements detected by LIBS, meaning that we expect to detect it only at the wt.% level [6]. The clear detection of Zn lines for Yarrada (sol 628) indicating strong enrichment of this element at the Kimberley outcrop triggered the need to develop a specific database to detect and possibly quantify Zn enrichments on Mars.  The database for Zn quantification was developed at LANL by generating pressed pellets from the powder of ZnO intimately mixed with powdered Brammer geological standard basalt BHVO-2. This procedure generates calibrated standards with 10 ZnO fractions ranging from of  0.1 wt.% to 100 wt.% in a matrix that is close to the average martian basaltic composition. After pre-processing of the spectra and normalization [7], comparison of the spectra is used to define the best Zn lines for Zn detection and quantification. Some Zn  emission lines are weak, while others interfere with the emission lines of major elements and cannot be used for calibration.  The best Zn emission lines for quantification purposes with ChemCam are located around 330nm, 480nm and 760nm. Figure 1 shows the effect of increasing Zn content on the emission lines located around 480nm. A Lorentzian fit of the emission lines is used to calculate their area, and generate a univariate regression model for Zn. Such a procedure has been used to generate univariate models for ChemCam elemental quantification [8]. Figure 2 presents the regression model for the Zn emission line at 481.2 nm with confidence bands for the linear fit in green and prediction bands at 95%, giving a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 3 wt.% in that case. Table 1 gives the limits of quantification and regression coefficients obtained on the best Zn emission lines.

The LOQ gives the limit of quantification with ChemCam at the 95% confidence level. The limit of detection of the Zn line at 481.2 nm is lower than this limit as can be seen on the Figure 1. If defined as the level at which an emission line can be detected above the 3 sigma of the background noise level of the spectrum, then it is about 0.5 wt.%. The model can also be improved by using multiple line detection and multivariate regression instead of relying on a single emission line [3]. Zn-rich targets detected by ChemCam on Mars: We have applied the Zn detection and quantification model on all data taken by ChemCam until sol 758. First, the Zn lines above 3 sigma of the background noise level of the spectrum are detected at the positions given in Table 1. Then the univariate regression model for the emission line at 481.2 nm is applied to quantify the Zn content. The highest predicted content is obtained for target Yarrada (location 5 sol 628) with ZnO=7.0 wt.%. When considering the number of detections and the predicted ZnO content of the targets as a function of time, there is a clear enhancement in Zn content around the Kimberley outcrop (analyses done from sol 580 to sol 630).   Yarrada #5 clearly stands out as the ChemCam target with the highest content in ZnO ever detected. From the RMI context image (Figure 4), Yarrada #5 is located above the rock strata, on the flat surface above. Shot to shot analysis of the ChemCam data indicates that the first two shots are contaminated by overlaying dust cover. Below the dust, the rock is slightly hydrated, and Zn content is about constant over all the 28 shots taken at that location.  Discussion of the results: The fact that Zn does not vary with depth suggests it is not linked to a thin weathering coating of the rock. There is no clear detection of S, indicating that Zn is unlikely to be present in the form of Zn-sulfide sphalerite which is its most common form on Earth. The APXS measurements at Kimberley also indicate strong enrichment in Zn on Windjana drill fines (3430-4680 ppm Zn) and Stephen (~8150 ppm Zn) on which MnO-rich coating has been detected [9]. The enrichment of Zn in Yarrada is also linked with an increase in Mn and Na content. Overall, Kimberley is an outcrop that presents strong enrichments in alkali and especially Mn content. The strong Mn signatures detected are interpreted as oxide coating, suggesting the presence of Mn-oxides possibly formed at a time when Mars surficial conditions involved abundant water and were more strongly oxidizing than today [10]. The Zn enrichment in Kimberley is probably also in the form of Zn-oxide and would support the conclusions derived from the presence of Mn-oxide veins in the outcrop.

Location #5 presents the strongest Zn enrichment detected by ChemCam.  ! Conclusion: High Zn content targets have been detected on Mars using the ChemCam instrument at the Kimberley outcrop. These targets are linked to a location where high Mn content was also detected. These enrichments can be interpreted as oxides deposited during previously highly oxidizing conditions on the surface of Mars.
