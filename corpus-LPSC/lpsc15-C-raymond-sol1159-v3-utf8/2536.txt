Introduction: The ChemCam instrument on Mars Science Laboratory has been roaming the surface of Mars for more than two years, analyzing the chemical compositions of more than 660 rock and soil targets with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). LIBS creates a plasma on a surface without sample preparation from different laser-to-target distances and geometries. However, ablation and collection angles relative to the rock or soil plane being sampled are highly variable and completely unconstrained. Understanding the effects of rock surface tilt relative to LIBS ablation and collection optics may aid in interpretation of LIBS data on all planetary surfaces, including Earth. Accordingly, this project was designed to test the effects of varying ablation and collection angles from 050° on LIBS spectra of glasses and rocks with compositions ranging from basalt to rhyolite. Samples Studied: Compositions studied included synthetic and natural glasses and rocks with compositions ranging from basalt to rhyolite (Figure 1), resulting in variations in refractive index, n (Table 1). Each sample was run both as a flat surface (polished to 200 grit) and as a pressed powder pellet with grain size of <45 µm. Some of the whole rock samples have visible grains 0.5-2 mm in diameter.  Experiments: Data were acquired in the Mineral Spectroscopy Laboratory at Mount Holyoke College using a Mars-analog LIBS equipped with three Ocean Optics HR2000+ user-configured spectrometers and a Quantel Ultra100 laser operating at 1064 nm, 10 Hz, with a 6-ns pulse width. Sample surfaces were tilted in 10° increments up to 50° relative to the ablation beam  and collection angles. The angle between ablation and collection was held constant at 13°. Samples were analyzed at 14 mJ/pulse under a 7-Torr CO2 atmosphere to simulate Martian atmospheric composition. Spectra were dark-subtracted and studied as both unnormalized counts and with data normalized to total spectrometer intensity. Results and Discussion: In pressed powder rock samples, total LIBS spectral intensity increases as ablation and collection angles approached normal (0°) to the sample surface (Figures 2 and 3) because material Table 1.

Comparison of spectra acquired at different sample tilts over the UV wavelength region (x-axis). The y-axis on these plots is digital number (DN, or counts recorded on the spectrometer) averaged over multiple integrations and cropped to show the lower third of each plot. Spectra on the top are displayed using essentially raw counts. For these unnormalized (raw) spectra, low ablation/collection angles have the most intense spectra. Spectra below have been normalized to total spectral intensity in this wavelength region. For normalized spectra, the continuum is relatively constant in intensity and shape between angles, and the highest collection angles result in the most intense emission lines. vaporized by the laser is ejected normal to the surface [2]. The same results have been obtained in lab experiments on various materials [2-7] at angles of incidence up to 60°. Multari et al. [8] further noted that changes in the plasma temperature alone cannot explain the relationship between signal intensity and angle of incidence. These previous studies generally focused on a single type of material (metal, etc.). In this study, we deliberately chose to examine samples with varying refractive indices to examine the magnitude of the signal variation as a function of material properties. In our results, the increase in signal at 0° incidence was more pronounced for basalts (34% increase in intensity) than for dacites and rhyolites (7% increase in intensity), suggesting that spectra of denser compositions with higher refractive indices have greater variability with tilt (Figure 4).  Reflectance of the p-polarized ablation beam at the sample surface, as calculated by the Fresnel equations, decreases as incidence angle increases over the range studied. Thus, the decrease in total spectral intensity at larger tilt cannot be explained by reduced energy absorption due to ablation beam reflection at the sample surface, because reflectance is minimized at ~56°. The decrease in total spectral intensity with increasing tilt may be influenced more by the collection geometry than the ablation angle. Experiments are in progress to decouple ablation and collection angles.   Geometry affects the relative contribution of the continuum to the total spectrum. Even after normalizing to total spectral intensity, spectra acquired at larger incident/collection angles have more intense peaks relative to the baseline than spectra acquired at normal ablation and collection angles. This suggests that the continuum has a larger contribution to total spectral intensity at ablation and collection angles normal to the sample surface than at larger angles. Implications: These initial results suggest that significant variations in signal can occur as a result of varying ablation and collection angles, and that the density and refractive properties of the samples being studied are also important. It is as yet unclear if this effect is related to the volume of material being ablated (a function of many variables including coupling, composition, and density) or the refractive properties of the sample (that vary with density and surface texture/roughness). Work in progress will evaluate the effects of these variations on accuracy of multivariate predictions of rock compositions from variablegeometry datasets.
