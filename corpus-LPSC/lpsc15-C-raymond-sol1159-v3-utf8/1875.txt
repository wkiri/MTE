Introduction and Background: Martian surface materials could potentially include a significant exogenous component, as is the case on the Moon. If so, this should be reflected in the siderophile geochemistry of the martian soil; many elements are enriched in meteorites compared to planetary crusts, particularly nickel [1] and iron. Any iron signal that might result from meteoritic influx to Mars would likely be obscured by Fe in endogenic basaltic materials common on the surface. In contrast, nickel is much more abundant in asteroidal material than the basaltic crust (Table 1). Thus, its abundance on the martian surface can be potentially used to trace meteoritic addition [1-3] and quantify the impact contribution to surface materials.  Several factors help bolster the likelihood that meteoritic nickel should be concentrated at the martian surface [see also 1-3]. First, rates inferred for surface erosion are very slow [4-6], so exogenous material has time to accumulate and mix with surface materials. Second, surface materials commonly are very old. Crater retention for billions of years is common on Mars and sedimentary material at Gale crater were plausibly deposited in the Late Noachian/Early Hesperian, >3.5 Ga [7]. Third, the impact flux was much higher in this early period, enhanced ~20-50× higher at the Late Noachian/Early Hesperian boundary than it is today [8, 9].  Previous in situ measurements of Ni on the martian surface have been somewhat contradictory. Mars Exploration Rover Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer results were used to suggest that ~1-3% chondritic material had been added to martian regolith based on enhanced Ni concentration in soils compared to primary martian basalts [1-2]. However, measurements of other elements, such as Cr, are not enhanced as expected if the all of the Ni results from of simple chondritic addition to the soils. Viking major element data from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements were interpreted as potentially implying much greater meteoritic addition to the fines at the martian surface (~40%; [10]).  Despite these contradictions, quantifying the meteoritic contribution to martian surface materials has substantial value. Constraining the addition of exogenous material has astrobiological implications because it can potentially provide an independent metric for how much exogenous organic matter is added to Mars [11]. In addition, potential exists to use the concentration of exogenous material observed in soils and sedimentary sequences to constrain surface exposure history, major hiatuses in deposition, and regolith evolution.  With over 150,000 LIBS spectra now available from the ChemCam instrument, there is potential to provide useful new information about this topic. Thus, we are working on refining the calibration of LIBS measurements of nickel, a topic that we explore in a companion abstract [16]. Here, we focus on updating theoretical expectations for the addition of meteoritic nickel into martian soils and sedimentary rocks. Note that this work is preliminary and further refinements in these calculations are ongoing.  Mass Flux: Most of the meteoritic mass that reaches Mars can be thought of as doing so in one of two size regimes: micrometeorites, or (much) larger impactors (Fig. 1). In 1990, Flynn and McKay [3] estimated the mass flux of micrometeoritic material as between 2,700 and 59,000 tons/yr by taking thencurrent estimates of the micrometeoritic flux to Earth (~15,000 to ~80,000 tons/yr) and scaling the results to Mars.  Estimates for the micrometeoritic flux at Earth have subsequently been substantially refined and reduced to 7,400±1,000 tons/yr [17]. Scaling this to Mars would suggest a mass flux in the micrometeorite range of ~1,250 tons/yr or ~9 g/km2/yr. At the current impact flux, this would deliver the equivalent of ~3 mm/Ga of meteoritic material to the surface. It is possible to assess the importance of larger impactors by converting the Hartmann model for crater accumulation [9] back to the projectile mass using Schmidt-Housen-Holsapple scaling [e.g., 18,19]; a similar approach was taken by [1] with different assumptions about scaling/cratering efficiency. The results are shown in Figure 1. These calculations illustrate that the crossover point where the mass delivered to Mars from projectiles forming impact craters is Table 1. Nickel abundances of selected materials Sample Ni abundance Ref. Mean C1 Chondrite  (typical of impactors) 1.1% [12] SNC meteorites (martian crust) 5-500 ppm µ~80 ppm [13, 14] Adirondack basalt  (e.g., primary igneous crust ) 200 ppm [15] Gusev basaltic soils (APXS) 200-700 ppm  µ~470 ppm [2] Meridiani soils (APXS) (*soils may have complicated exhumation history) 600-1300 ppm  µ~840 ppm [2] Gale Crater high-Ni layered target Natkusiak (ChemCam; calibration refinements in progress [16]) 700-2900 ppm µ~1800 ppm N/A  larger than the mass from micrometeorites occurs at a mass of ~2×1014 g, corresponding to impactors that form craters of ~5.75 km in diameter. Because impacts at these scales are comparatively rare, the contribution of meteoritic material from these events will be highly stochastic - enhanced in the crust in the vicinity of large craters, and relatively unimportant elsewhere. For this reason, we neglect the contribution of larger impactors in the calculations that follow and leave an assessment of their role for future work; this contribution nonetheless is likely to be important for ancient crustal material on Mars (Noachian and pre-Noachian crust). Mixing of Ni with surface materials: Once the meteoritic influx of material to the surface is estimated, it is important to consider how this material is mixed with the regolith. The behavior, growth, and gardening of Mars regolith is much less studied than that of the Moon [20-21]. There are also complications in how meteoritic material is delivered; virtually all micrometeorites delivered to Mars interact with, and are potentially ablated by, the martian atmosphere [3].   With these caveats in mind, we can make a new estimate for how much nickel we might expect to find. We consider as an example the Hesperian volcanic plains of Gusev crater. First, we assume that all of the mass delivered as micrometeorites ultimately reaches the surface and mixes into the regolith. The regolith thickness in Gusev is uncertain, but ~10 m is generally thought to be consistent with the site's geology [5]. Second, we use the Hartmann chronology function to determine the flux of incoming material [22; fn. 1]. This implicitly requires that the micrometeorite flux is proportional to the flux of crater-forming impactors. Combined, these assumptions lead to an estimate of ~1.6 cm of meteoritic material incorporated into the regolith over 3.5 Ga.  If this were uniformly mixed into a 10-m thick regolith layer, it would represent a ~0.2% contaminant; leading to 10% enhancement in the concentration of Ni in the soil (220 ppm), much less than estimated from APXS (Table 1). Reaching the factor of ~2.35× enhancement that is observed would require the accumulating meteoritic material be concentrated in the upper 68 cm of soil. Because gardening of the regolith is expected to be particularly effective at and near the surface, this is plausible. Alternative explanations are that (1) nickel abundances might be enhanced in the soil during aeolian deflation of the soil [5], (2) the basaltic soil on the Gusev plains may not be entirely locally derived, or (3) the observed Ni concentrations may have been enhanced or concentrated by fluids. The ChemCam laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) instrument also has the capability of measuring Ni in martian soils and rocks, though it is not yet calibrated for such measurements. Our preliminary calibration based on doped samples and multiple matrices [16] suggests that Ni can be measured with an accuracy of ca. ±200 ppm if the major element chemistry of the materials being lased is a good match to the matrix used in the Ni standards. Once the LIBS Ni calibration is completed, further constraints on the distribution of Ni among materials probed by MSL should provide additional useful insights into the distribution and abundance of Ni among materials on the surface.
