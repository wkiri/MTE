Both Gale and Gusev craters are located near the dichotomy boundary between the Noachian Highlands and the younger volcanics and transitional units to the north (Fig. 1). Element ratios in these samples may provide a link between the regional provinces analyzed by GRS and the materials at the two landing sites. The lithophile data may lead to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the martian crust in this region of Mars, while the volatile element components SO3, Cl, and water provide information on volcanic aerosols, weathering processes and potentially recent climate [3]. Fig. 1 - Portion of the Mars Global Geologic map with arrows showing Gale (West) and Gusev (East) craters on the dichotomy boundary.  See Fig. 2 for scale and reference.  Geochemical components and normalization: Comparing the chemistry of Gale and Gusev samples with other martian data must take into account the different geochemical components in the samples. The most important distinction is between the lithophile elements including Al, Si, Fe, Mn, Ca, Na, Mg, etc. that represents the rock component, and  the volatile elements including H, C, Cl, S, that represent later external input to the soils and rocks. Normalization to SiO2, provides a way to correct the lithophile elements for variable amounts of the mobile element component, mainly sulfur, chlorine and water.

Regional trends from GRS: The GRS compositions reflect the integrated abundances to a depth of ~ 0.5 m, but the instrument is not collimated, and ~ 50% of the received gamma rays come from an area ten degrees in diameter on the surface below the instrument [4]. Thus most of the signal from each 5 degree binned data used in this study comes from outside the nominal area represented by the data. Because Gale and Gusev craters are only ~ 3 degrees in diameter, there is no way to get their unique GRS signatures. Therefore, because the two landing sites are on the dichotomy boundary, Example of GRS 10 degree "pixel"   and due to the low resolution of the GRS data, the area seen in the geological map has been divided into regions on 5 degree boundaries (Fig. 2) that have distinctive GRS chemical signatures [1]. An example of the differences in the chemistry of these regions is seen in the areas outlined on the CaO/SiO2 versus FeO/SiO2 data (Fig. 3). Note that the highlands crust south of Gale has lower FeO/SiO2 and CaO/SiO2 than the nearby Elysium volcanic complex and the areas of the Medusa Fossae to the north of Gale.

Bridges pers. comm.) compared with the GRS data for the region. The circle at high K2O/SiO2 ratios reflects the feldspar-rich end of the basaltic trend. Symbol legend in Fig. 3.  Comparisons between GRS data, Gale (Curiosity) and Gusev (Spirit): CaO/SiO2 versus FeO/SiO2 data from the rovers is compared with the GRS data in Fig. 4. In contrast to data from the rocks, the soils at the two sites are relatively homogeneous. The Gale soil represented by the Portage analysis is somewhat higher in FeO/SiO2 and CaO/SiO2 (and chlorine) than the soil analyses in the Columbia Hills [5]. Therefore, Gale soil could reflect a contribution from nearby Medusa Fossae deposits enriched in these elements. For the rocks, the lithophile elements including Ca and Fe are more scattered, but CaO abundances are lower than the Elysium and younger volcanics to the north, probably eliminating any relationship with those areas. The rocks analyzed by Curiosity show a huge range in K2O/SiO2 (Fig. 5) that is not reflected in the regional GRS data, suggesting a local phenomenon. For the data from Curiosity, Fisk et al. [6] suggest that addition of a K-Fe-Mg-rich secondary phase (possibly phyllosilicate) is possible, and/or addition of separate K-rich and FeMg-rich phases. Schmidt et al. [7] call upon mantle metasomatism and different amounts of partial melting to generate these differences. Volatile elements: The regional water equivalent H content of the areas shown in Fig. 1 from the GRS experiment ranges from ~ 3 to 7 wt%. The water content of materials at Gale ranges from 2 wt% to 9 wt% from MSL ChemCam, SAM and Chemin analyses on Curiosity [8], and is mostly part of the amorphous component of the soils and rocks. At Gusev, SO3 and Cl in the soils comprise ~ 8 wt% of the total [3], and water in the Columbia Hills ranged up to 17 wt % [3, 9], consistent with a high local GRS water signature, especially for the area of the Medusa Fossae area near Gusev. The lack of enrichment of the highly fluid mobile element lithium determined by ChemCam [5] in most samples from Gale argues against a hydrothermal component, but does not rule out a volcanic aerosol component of the soil. However, the detection of enriched manganese vein deposits and other diagenetic features in Gale [10], and enriched silicon deposits at Home Plate in Gusev [11] indicate that transport of fluid mobile elements by aqueous or hydrothermal processes is common on Mars. Conclusions: The geochemical data from the GRS experiment on Mars Odyssey provides a regional context for the geochemical data from the Curiosity rover in Gale crater and the data from Spirit in Gusev. These comparisons are providing new insights into the diversity of petrologic and aqueous processes on Mars. The diversity of compositions at the landing sites may reflect the different regional compositions seen in the GRS data.
