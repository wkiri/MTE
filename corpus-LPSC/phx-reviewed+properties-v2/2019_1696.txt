Introduction:  Selection of the InSight landing site took place over a six-year period in which engineering constraints were identified, surface characteristics distinguished and landing sites were progressively downselected to one in western Elysium Planitia [1]. Engineering constraints important to the selection include: Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) elevation below −2.5 km, latitude between 3°N-5°N, ellipse size 130 km by 27 km, radar-reflective surface, a load-bearing surface without substantial fine-grained dust, rock abundance <10%, 1-5 m and 84 m length slopes <15°, and a fragmented regolith 3-5 m thick. Unlike all other Mars landers, there are no science objectives that influenced landing site selection [1].  The InSight landing site was selected after comprehensive evaluation of surface characteristics from existing remote sensing data and models as well as targeted orbital information acquired from Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. This evaluation resulted in predictions of the surface characteristics of the sites [1], which are tested in this abstract. Relating remote sensing signatures to surface characteristics at landing sites allows these sites to be used as ground truth for the orbital data and is essential for selecting and validating landing sites for future missions. The sources for all remote sensing data cited in this abstract can be found in [1] and for brevity not referenced individually herein. Landing Location: High-Resolution Science Experiment (HiRISE) images show the lander, is located at 4.50°N, 135.62°E at an elevation of -2613.426 m with respect to the MOLA geoid in the northwest-central portion of the E9 reference landing ellipse in western Elysium Planitia [2]. The lander is located in Homestead hollow, a degraded impact crater adjacent to a slightly rockier and rougher terrain with a concentration of rocky ejecta craters nearby [3].  General Predictions: General predictions are that the landing site would be safe for the InSight landing system and would be generally similar to the Spirit landing site, which has relatively low rock abundance, is moderately dusty, and formed a fragmented regolith over Hesperian basalts from impact and eolian processes. The safe landing of InSight indicates the radar altimeter worked correctly and the surface was load bearing as predicted from Arecibo radar analysis and the surface is without meters of fine-grained dust. As described in more detail elsewhere [4], the most common geomorphic feature observed at the landing site are craters in various stages of degradation, ending with hollows (soil filled craters) that are also common at the Spirit landing site [5] (Figs. 1 and 2).  Thermal Inertia and Albedo:  The InSight landing site is generally similar to the Viking, Spirit and Curiosity landing sites with moderate thermal inertia and intermediate to high albedo. TES (3 km/pixel, nighttime) and THEMIS (100 m/pixel) thermal inertia of the landing site is 236 and 166 J m-2  K-1 s-1/2, respectively, which is consistent with a surface dominated by fine to very fine sand with low rock abundance (as observed). TES albedo is 0.24 (7.5 km/pixel) and the dust cover index is 0.95 (3.75 km/pixel), both indicating a moderately dusty surface (similar to the Gusev cratered plains), which is consistent with the reddish color of the landscape and the extensive dark spot produced by the landing thrusters that removed the dust [6]. Rock Abundance:  Orbital estimates of rock abundance indicate a low rock abundance surface [1]. IRTM rock abundance (60 km/pixel) for the lander location is 4% and although no TES rock abundance (7.5 km/pixel) exists at the lander location, the nearest estimate is 3.3%. HiRISE rock counts show none (generally >1.5 m in diameter) detected within 260 m of the landing location. These orbital estimates are consistent with preliminary rock counts made on the ground. The smooth plains surface that makes up Homestead hollow (Fig. 1) has a rock abundance of 1-2% for diameters >10 cm and the rocky field to the west is around 2-3 times that. Rock and pebble counts are consistent with a surface whose rock abundance is between the Phoenix and Spirit landing sites, as expected from orbital measurements [7]. Preliminary counts suggest a pebble rich surface [8] similar to the Spirit landing site, which occurred via eolian deflation of fines [5]. A pebble rich surface similar to the Spirit and Phoenix landing sites was also inferred from Arecibo radar brightness. Rock abundance this low has little effect on the bulk thermal inertia [9]. Slopes:  Estimates of slopes of the landing ellipse were made at 100 m length scale relevant to radar tracking of the surface, and 1-5 m relevant to lander stability at touchdown. To estimate relief and slopes at 100 m scale, MOLA data were extrapolated from 1.2 km to 0.3 km length scale to 100 m using the Allen deviation and Hurst exponent, assuming self-affine statistics [1]. Root Mean Square (RMS) slopes (<5°) and relief (Allen deviation) extrapolated to 100 m length scale (<1 m) for the landing location averaged in 12 km bins are the lowest measurable in the ellipse. In addition, the MOLA pulse spread, a measure of the RMS relief within the ∼75 m diameter laser spot after removal of regional slopes at the landing location averaged in 15 km bins is <1 m suggesting relief of <10 m. The SHARAD roughness of the InSight landing site, which is sensitive to slopes at 10-100 m length scale, suggests it is in between the Opportunity and Phoenix landing sites in roughness at the 10-100 m [1], which are both smooth at this length scale. One hundred m slopes within 1 km of the lander in the HiRISE DEM indicate an RMS slope of 1.0°. All of these measures indicate an exceptionally smooth surface at this length scale that is consistent with the low relief surface and flat horizon (Fig. 1). At the meter length scale, the landing location is also extraordinarily smooth. In the HiRISE DEM, the RMS slope of the landing location at 2 m and 5 m length scale are 2.9° and 2.4° with no area >15°, which is exceptionally smooth for the smooth terrain [1]. These measurements are consistent with the 2 m RMS slope of 1.6° for the workspace. Corinto Secondaries:  During the evaluation of prospective InSight landing sites, it was recognized that secondary craters from the fresh rayed crater Corinto were omnipresent [1]. Corinto is among the youngest rayed craters on Mars, having formed after a young 2.5±0.2 Ma Elysium lava flow, but before Zunil secondaries (0.1-1 Ma). Corinto secondaries have distinctive bright ejecta and their density was estimated in 2.5 km square samples in HiRISE [1]. The InSight lander is located in a pixel with a medium-high density (~5% of the surface covered by secondary craters), so it is not surprising to have a Corinto secondary within view of the lander. The Corinto secondary, dubbed Corintito is located about 20 m to the southeast, just beyond the smooth terrain of Homestead hollow (Fig. 1). In HiRISE, it has the characteristic bright ejecta [4]. From InSight it has a shallow bowl shape with sandy interior. It appears fresh, with no bedforms, and its sandy interior suggests no subsequent impacts have deposited rocks on it. The sandy interior suggests that the impact occurred in dominantly sandy material with few rocks. Corintito has a depth/diameter ratio typical of secondary craters (~0.1) in preliminary estimates, which is slightly deeper than estimates made in orbital DEMs [1]. Regolith Thickness:  Measurements of the onset diameter of rocky ejecta craters indicate that a near surface fragmented regolith 3-17 m thick exists at the landing site [10]. HiRISE images of nearby Hephaestus Fossae scarps and fragmentation theory indicate a relatively fine grained near surface regolith that grades into coarse breccia overlying intact bedrock [1]. Fresh non-rocky and rocky ejecta craters <60 m diameter were used to estimate the minimum and maximum regolith thickness, respectively, across the ellipse [11]. In the immediate area of the lander, these data indicate a minimum and maximum regolith thickness of 2.6 m and 3.9 m, respectively [12]. If the regolith is halfway between these, it is 3.2 m thick near the lander. Preliminary observations near the lander are consistent with a ~3 m thick regolith. The nearest relatively fresh crater to the lander that is tens of meters in diameter is 45 m diameter about 150 m to the northwest. It is not a rocky ejecta crater indicating the regolith is at least 3.8 m thick, which is consistent with the ellipse wide estimate [12]. Conclusions:  The InSight landing site (Fig. 1) is consistent with predictions made from remote sensing data. The landing site was safe for InSight and is generally similar to the Spirit landing site (Fig. 2), which has relatively low rock abundance, is moderately dusty, and formed a fragmented regolith over Hesperian basalts from impact and eolian processes.
