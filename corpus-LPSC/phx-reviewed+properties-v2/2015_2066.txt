In fact, volcanoes were still active, the environment was wetter and warmer and the magnetosphere still existed. Source of organic Mars: Various sources of endogenous organic matter (OM) could have existed including (a) abiotic production via hydrothermal vents, volcanism and atmospheric synthesis and (b) biotic synthesis. Currently, the sources of extraterrestrial organic compounds that should be delivered to Mars are known: carbon-rich meteorites, micrometeorites, comets and interstellar dust particles. Stabilization of the OM takes place through three mechanisms described in the article of Lützow (1): (1) First, the selective preservation of OM is described as a phenomenon of accumulation of some compounds because of their resistance against the environment.  (2) The second path which allows the persistence of OM is the space isolation of OM from environmental stress.  (3) The last way to stabilize the OM is intermolecular interactions between minerals or metal ions with OM. One of the primary objectives of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission is to search for environments on the Martian surface that have preserved OM.  Structure and aim of SAM Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) is one of the instruments of the MSL mission. Three analytical devices are onboard SAM: the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS), the Gas Chromatograph (GC) and the Mass Spectrometer (MS) (2). Solid sample preparation: To adapt the nature of a sample to the analytical devices used, a sample preparation and gas processing system implemented with (a) a pyrolysis system, (b) wet chemistry: MTBSTFA and TMAH (c) the hydrocarbon trap (silica beads, Tenax® TA and Carbosieve G) which is employed to concentrate volatiles released from the sample prior to the GC-MS analyses. Detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons All chlorinated hydrocarbons detected during the Viking I and II missions and MSL (Rocknest (RN), John Klein (JK), Cumberland (CB) and Confidence Hill (CH)) are listed in Table 1. Viking landers (1976): The origin of chloromethane and dichloromethane was explained at the time by terrestrial contamination from the instruments (3). In a recent paper from Navarro-González (4), these results have been reinterpreted and chlorinated compounds could have been the product of the reaction of perchlorates identified by Phoenix (5) with martian organic carbon present in the sample or terrestrial organic carbon in the instrument or sample handling chain.  MSL (2011): A diverse range of chlorinated hydrocarbons have been detected with SAM after GCMS analysis of samples collected from several sites explored by Curiosity rover (Table 1). Some of these chlorohydrocarbons are produced during pyrolysis by the reaction of martian oxychlorine compounds in the samples with terrestrial carbon from a derivatization agent (MTBSTFA) present in SAM (6, 7). Chlorobenzene (CBZ) cannot be formed by the reaction of MTBSTFA and perchlorates (6) and two other reaction pathways for CBZ were therefore proposed : (1) reactions between the volatile thermal degradation products of perchlorates (e.g. O2, Cl2 and HCl) and Tenax® and (2) the interaction of perchlorates (T > 200 °C) with OM from Mars's soil such as benzenecarboxylates (8, 9).   Among all the sample analyzed by SAM, JK and CB sites are interesting; smectites (phyllosilicates - 18 to 22 wt %)  and quartz (0.1 to 1 wt %) were detected at the two sites (10) and could have an important role in the preservation of OM (1). Objectives This study investigates several hypotheses for chlorinated hydrocarbon formation by looking for: (a) all products coming from the interaction of Tenax® and perchlorates, (b) products between various soil sample and perchlorates and (c) sources of chlorinated hydrocarbon precursors.   Experiments and methods:  To answer some of our remaining questions, laboratory experiments were done in several solid matrices which Viking MSL RN JK CB CH CH3Cl CH2Cl2 nd nd nd nd nd CH3Cl CH2Cl2 CHCl3 CCl4 nd C4H7Cl C6H5Cl CH3Cl CH2Cl2 CHCl3 CCl4 nd ndC6H5Cl CH3Cl CH2Cl2 CHCl3 CCl4 C3H6Cl2 C4H7Cl C6H5Cl CH3Cl CH2Cl2nd nd nd C4H7Cl C6H5Cl Table 1: major chlorinated hydrocarbon detected during the Viking and MSL mission. MXT-CLP column (nd: not detected).   were brought directly in contact with perchlorates and heated.   Solid matrices Four solid matrices were analyzed. Fused silica: It is used as an organics-free sample. Tenax®: This polymer absorbent can release organic compounds when heated to temperatures > 300 °C) (11). JSC-Mars1: JSC-1 is a martian regolith simulant collected in volcanic active area in Hawaii (12).    Fontainebleau Sand: Fontainebleau sand is almost pure silica (quartz). This sand has been previously heated to 700 °C during 24 h in our laboratory.  Experiments GC-MS Analysis  In this work, we have performed a direct (i.e. solid matrix and perchlorates are mixed together in the injector) and indirect (i.e. perchlorate is in the reactor which is upstream from the injector where the solid samples are placed).  The abundances of Ca-perchlorate (3 or 9 wt %) used in these experiments are much higher than SAM perchlorate abundances estimated to be 0.3-0.5 wt % at Rocknest (6). The GC-MS used in experiment is a Thermo Trace GC Ultra with Restek Rtx-5 Sil-MS column (30m×0.25mm×0.25µm), its injector is Optic 3 from ATASGL, and the MS is a Thermo DSQII. The helium flow was maintained constant at 1 mL/min (split 10 mL/min). The temperature of the column was started and held 8 min at 35 °C, then increased at 7 °C/min to a final temperature of 300 °C and held 2 min at this temperature.  Results and discussions:  In the light of the results presented in Table 3, we can conclude that the chlorinated hydrocarbons can originate from two origins: Martian origin Once the OM and perchlorates are raised to high temperature, chlorinated compounds are produced, even in the sample which contains 3 wt % (B2). Precursors of chlorinated hydrocarbons might be preserved on the surface of Mars as the persistent molecules found in the sample of Fontainebleau's sand (A3). SAM origin Chlorobenzene is also product by the reaction of perchlorates and Tenax® as other compounds (e.g. No. 9-24)   Conclusion. Chlorinated compounds highlighted by SAM on Mars could have several origins: from perchlorate oxidation of MTBSTFA, Tenax® and/or Martian organics. However, due to the higher concentration of chlorobenzene in the Mars sample compared to the blank, this compound is interpreted to be from martian origin. The other line of supporting evidence for a martian chlorobenzene source is the detection of m/z 112 and 114 at ~3:1 ratio in the EGA data that is attributed to CBZ.  Based on the SAM gas flow design the CBZ released from the sample cannot be attributed to reaction products from Tenax and the hydrocarbon trap.  Then, to determine the origin of chlorobenzene, it is necessary to go further in laboratory investigations by using other way of analyses (13).  References: 1. M. V. Lutzow et al. (2006) Eur. J.
