Introduction: The recent discovery of perchlorates (ClO4 ) by Phoenix [1] has triggered a high interest for this ion which is rare on the surface of Earth. Perchlorate solutions have very low eutectics that favor the potential formation of liquid water on the surface of Mars [2]. The mechanisms by which such a highly oxidized ion may form, especially on Mars, remain largely unknown. Two major pathways are possible: atmospheric oxidation of aerosols [3], potentially through UV, or reaction of strong oxidants like H2O2 with chlorides in liquid or solid form. A major problem for these models is the lack of thermodynamic data. Between chloride (Cl oxidation state -1) and perchlorate (oxidation state +7), three other ions exist: hypochlorite ClO  (+1), chlorite ClO2  (+3) and chlorate ClO3  (+5). These ions may be present (and undetected) at the Phoenix landing site as intermediate species of the processes leading to perchlorates.  To further understand these ions, we have started a detailed investigation of the thermodynamic properties of the intermediate oxidation states of chloride [4]. Of these intermediate species, chlorate is the most stable [5] and therefore most expected to be present with perchlorate in the Phoenix soils. Therefore, in a first step we focused on sodium and magnesium chlorates as the most relevant to the Phoenix chemistry [2,6].   0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 255 260 265 270 Ev ap ora ti on R ate ( mm /h r) Temperature (K) 20 wt% 30 wt% 40 wt% 50 wt% Figure 1. Evaporation rate of NaClO3 as a function of sample temperature and concentration.  Dashed lines are theoretical evaporation rates for each concentration, calculated from a modified Ingersoll [7] equation and Pitzer model [8].  The solid line is for pure supercooled liquid water.  Methods: Evaporation Rates. Experiments were performed in a Mars simulation chamber using the same methods as in Chevrier et al, 2009 [2]. A sample of chlorate solution was lowered into a chilled CO2 environment, which was then pumped down to 7 mbar, while still maintaining less than 1% relative humidity RH. Mass loss (in grams) was measured during exposure to 7.00 ± 0.01 mbar of CO2. From this, the evaporation rate E (in mm h -1 ) was determined. Eutectic Determinations. Eutectic temperatures were determined by freezing a small amount (~2-3 mL) of saturated solution between two copper plates enclosed in a polystyrene cell. We monitored the resistance between the copper plates as the solution melted, watching for a discontinuity in the evolution of the conductance (inverse of the resistance).  Knowing the frozen solution will have near-infinite resistance that will suddenly decrease as the solution melts, the eutectic temperature was identified by a discontinuity in the conductance profile. Results: Evaporation Experiments. At temperatures between 256 and 267 K, evaporation rates of sodium chlorate (Fig. 1) range from 0.141 mm h -1 (50 wt% at 258 K) to 0.443 mm h -1 (20 wt% at 264 K). As seen in previous studies, evaporation rate is dependent both directly on the temperature and inversely on the concentration of the solution [2]. For instance, the evaporation rate of a 50 wt% solution ranges from 0.141 to 0.325 mm h -1 over a temperature range of 9 K. The evaporation rate is also dependent on chlorate concentration: at 265 K, the 20 wt% sodium chlorate evaporates at 0.443 mm h -1 while the 50 wt% evaporates at 0.284 mm h -1 . Eutectic Experiments. Most values for eutectic temperatures of the salts in question have been determined theoretically, making experimental determinations necessary. We have found the following eutectic points: 243 K for 50 wt% Mg(ClO3)2 (Fig 3); 240 K for 52 wt% NaClO4; 247 K for 39 wt% NaClO3.  Discussion: Sodium Chlorate Evaporation. The results of our experiments have shown that evaporation rates have a direct relationship with the temperature of the solution and an inverse relationship with the concentration. Assuming the atmospheric conditions remained relatively constant, these results indicate that a saturated NaClO3 liquid solution with a depth of 1 m would last approximately 222 sols at 256 K and 125 sols at 267 K on Mars.  Eutectic Experiments. Few data are available from low-temperature experiments with chlorate salts. Previous calculations have shown that the eutectic temperature for Mg-perchlorate is much lower (around 206 K [2]) than we found for chlorate.  Calculated eutectic temperatures for NaClO4 (236 K) and NaClO3 (250 K) solutions seem to be in good agreement with our experimental data.   0.001 0.01 0.1 110 100 180 200 220 240 260 280 Lo g1 0(C on du cta nc e, μ mh o) Temperature (K) 243 K Figure 2. Eutectic temperature experimental data for saturated solutions of Mg(ClO3)2. The large increase in conductance results from a phase change between solid and liquid, which is taken to be the eutectic temperature.  Stability Diagrams. There is a clear lack of thermodynamic data for the various species of oxidized chlorine, especially those associated with magnesium. From the literature and our own data, we have constructed stability diagrams for NaClO3 and Mg(ClO3)2, as shown in Fig. 3. While Fig. A uses theoretical calculations from the Pitzer parameters [8], there is an absence of Pitzer parameters for Mg 2+ and ClO3 . In Fig. 3B the lines are simply polynomial fits which include the experimentally determined eutectic temperature of 243 K. NaClO3 (Fig. 3A) does not form any hydrates, which is in accordance with its high eutectic of 250 K. On the other hand, Mg(ClO3)2 (Fig. 3B) forms three hydrates (2, 4 and 6), which, interestingly, correspond exactly to the hydrates of Mg-perchlorate, indicating a possible direct pathway between both phases. Future work will include determining evaporation rates for magnesium chlorate, sodium chlorite, and sodium hypochlorite in Martian surface conditions. In addition, more data points will be collected on the liquid - ice liquidus lines, allowing us to refine our stability diagrams for each salt. From these, we will be able to extract Pitzer parameters, which in turn enable us to model evaporation and freezing processes under martian conditions.  Once thermodynamic properties are calculated, we will simulate Phoenix surface conditions with all oxidized chlorine species present. Our model in Geochemical Workbench allows for simultaneous freezing and evaporation, giving us the best possible scenarios to determine exactly which species will precipitate. ClO  (hypochlorite) and ClO2  (chlorite) are both quite unstable and thus unlikely to be present [5]. However, ClO3  is almost as stable as perchlorate, and may be present (yet undetected) at the Phoenix landing site. If this is the case, it would be interesting to know what the molar ratios between ClO4  and ClO3  would be. Additionally, we would be able to pin down the associated cations, whether they are Na +, Mg 2+ , K + or Ca ++ . Conclusions: The evaporation rates of NaClO3 are similar to those of NaClO4, but higher than those of Mg(ClO4)2.  Currently, magnesium perchlorate has the lowest known eutectic temperature for any brine, which, along with its low evaporation rates, suggests that it should be the dominant liquid phase at the Phoenix landing site [9]. The other oxidized chlorine compounds require further study as they have intermediate eutectic temperatures that could potentially affect martian surface geochemistry. References: [1] Hecht M.
