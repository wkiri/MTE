There is a great interest in laser remote sensing instrument by combining Raman, Fluorescence spectroscopy, and Lidar receiver systems onto the rover system for planetary rover and lander missions. Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy has been utilized for mineralogy and surface organic materials inspection [1-2] and lidar backscattered signals for Mars atmospheric characterization under Phoenix lander mission [3-4]. Surface water, ice, and dry ice (solid CO2) information are obtained by using the instrument in the RamanFluorescence mode, when the laser beam points at the surface [5-7]. Atmospheric aerosols and cloud distributions are obtained by operating the instrument in the lidar mode, when the laser beam points at the atmosphere [6-7]. This instrument is highly sensitive, lightweight, and miniature active remote sensing instrument using a 4-inch telescope, a miniature spectrometer, and a lidar receiver system. The spacequalifiable laser transmits 20 Hz laser pulses into the surface or atmosphere during experiment. The 355 nm, 532 nm, and 1064 nm laser outputs are transmitted to the targets and backscattered signals are received from the targets. The telescope collects the return signals from the atmosphere/surface and focuses them into a 0.4 mm fiber optics cable, which is connected to the receiving optics. As part of the receiving optics, a PMT is used to detect the atmospheric return signals and ICCD is used to acquire surface return signals. Raman/Fluorescence/Lidar sensing instrument including transmitter, receiver, and power conditioning/data acquisition are all integrated onto the rover system in Fig. 1 [7]. The instrument is demonstrated on a mobile rover that is capable of performing both teleoperated and autonomous surface operations. This combined remote instrument performs Raman and Fluorescence spectroscopy out to 15 m on the surface and provides atmospheric profiling over longer ranges (>10-km) [7]. In this study, we discuss integrated remote Raman, Fluorescence, and Lidar instrument from robotic platform, which can be used for studying minerals, ices and organic compounds on the surface of Mars, Moon, asteroids, Europa, and other icy satellites of outer planets and for characterizing the distribution of dust and aerosols as appropriate. In this study, we emphasize on Raman spectroscopy and lidar technology. Raman spectra and Lidar return signals are reported in this article, which were detected at different times from the robotic platform. Figures 2 and 3 show Raman spectra from isopropanol and also lidar range corrected return signals that were recorded on April 20, 2012, in the afternoon of the shiny sky at NASA LaRC. Raman spectra were acquired from isoproponol using the prototype instrument from a robotic platform at a distance of 15 meter as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a shows the measured image of the isopropanol combustible substance using MediaCybernetics Image-Pro Express Version 6.0 application software and the converted Raman spectra of this isopropanol substance. The strongest Raman bands are produced by the stretching vibrational modes. The Raman spectrum of isopropanol in Fig. 2b shows a band, but it has a very strong and sharp band at 3056 cm-1 shifted down from 2969 cm-1 for isopropanol substance. We were able to detect broadband in the high frequency region. It can be seen that the Raman bands of this substance is very prominent making them easily identifiable through Raman spectroscopy [2]. Fig. 3 shows atmospheric features of the return signals for the PMT lidar channel at 532-nm. The data presented in the figures were analyzed with 1200 shot averaging (1 minute) to reduce noise. The profile spans between 0.0 to 6.0 km altitudes. The time spans between 0 to 7200 sec represents the lidar signals monitoring time with ~17-mJ/pulse (532 nm laser line) out of 45 mJ/pulse full laser energy (~14 mJ/pulse of 355 nm, ~17 mJ/pulse of 532 nm, and ~14 mJ/pulse of 1064 nm). Lidar return signals were recorded on April 20, 2012, in the afternoon from 2:09 pm to 4:10 pm at LaRC. Fig. 3a shows average atmospheric range corrected lidar signal profile and Fig. 3b shows image of range corrected signals. Aerosols and clouds were detected with this 4-inch telescope. The aerosols and clouds were observed at 1) 0.2-0.5 km low level aerosol boundary layer, 2) around 1.0 km (cloud layer), and 3) 0.8 to 1.2 km upper aerosol boundary layer. NASA LaRC constructed this miniature Raman and Fluorescence spectrometer and lidar receiver system inhouse for detecting minerals and organics from planetary surfaces and atmospheric aerosols and clouds distribution and profiling. In this paper, we discuss about laser remote sensing instrument, rover system, and remote sensing from a robotic platform, results on Raman spectroscopy and atmospheric lidar sensing. Finally, we have successfully developed laser remote sensing instrument from basic research to prototype instrument for characterizing the isopropanol as well as atmospheric aerosol/cloud profiling. In addition, we have demonstrated prototype unit performance from a Robotic platform at NASA Langley Research Center on October and November 2012 to characterize isopropanol and naphthalene out-off 15 meter and conducting atmospheric aerosol/cloud profiling out of >10 km. This prototype multi-sensing instrument development and its characterization provides valuable design and technology  information and thus enables future remote sensor development for planetary science investigations about the geological processes, biological potential, understanding of aqueous processes on planetary surfaces; and atmospheric transport, dynamics and radiative processes. This instrument, with holographic grating spectrometer and lidar with atmospheric sensing capability, provides unprecedented capability for future NASA Mars Sample Return (MSR), Lunar South-Pole, Europa lander/rover, and Asteroid Rendezvous missions.
