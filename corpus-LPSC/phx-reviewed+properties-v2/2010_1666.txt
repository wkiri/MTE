Introduction: The NASA Phoenix lander equipped with the Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA) [1] identified perchlorate anions [2] in the northern plains on May 25, 2008. The existence of perchlorate, inferred to exist in salts as surface deposits, is useful because specific perchlorate hydrates could be used as indicators of past hydrological cycles. The potential exchange of H2O between the martian atmosphere and hydrated minerals in the regolith has been investigated since H2O- equivalent hydrogen was first identified by Mars Odyssey. It has been shown that some hydrated sulfate and clay minerals can potentially contribute to the H2O cycle on a seasonal/diurnal scale whereas other hydrated minerals are more stable and can act as a reservoir for H2O [3,4]. Evidence from studies of clinoptilolite dehydration showed that this zeolite can remain up to 90% hydrated (20 wt% H2O) under Mars surface conditions [4]. The dehydration of gypsum (21 wt% H2O) has also been shown to be unlikely over a seasonal cycle based on dehydration kinetics [5] and thermal stability. Therefore, the extensive North Polar Gypsum Dunes represent a significant reservoir of H2O. The inference of hydrated Mg perchlorate adds to the list of hydrated martian minerals that have the potential to provide information on past hydrologic cycles and also may participate in the global H2O cycle. Indeed, one formula unit of Mg(ClO4)2.6H2O contains 32.6% H2O. Knowledge of the crystal structures and stabilities of perchlorate hydrates is necessary to understand the importance of this reservoir in terms of H2O cycling between the regolith and the atmosphere. Perchlorate [ClO4]-1 ions contain Cl in the +VII oxidation state, making them very strong oxidants. As a consequence, these salts are highly reactive, and they are hygroscopic and rapidly deliquesce when exposed to humid conditions. This reactivity makes them very rare on the Earth's surface except in arid regions. Naturally occurring perchlorate minerals were reported initially from the Chilean nitrate deposits of the Atacama Desert [6]. More recently, perchlorate minerals were reported in playa deposits of the Southwestern United States [7]. This occurrence indicates that natural geochemical processes are capable of producing perchlorate minerals.     Cl occurs in these salts in tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, along with metals such as Na, Mg, Ca, Ni, and Zn coordinating with as many as six H2O molecules per formula unit. The Mg(ClO4)2.6H2O structure [8] is orthorhombic (Pmn21) and each Mg2+ cation is octahedrally coordinated by H2O molecules (Fig.1). Isolated perchlorate tetrahedra form two-dimensional rings around the octahedra perpendicular to the c-axis.   Figure 1. Crystal structures of the Mg perchlorate hydrate phases. Mg (green) is coordinated by H2O (blue spheres). Cl (yellow) is tetrahedrally coordinated by oxygen (black spheres).  We have obtained new experimental results on the dehydration behavior of the Mg(ClO4)2 system under vacuum and controlled relative humidity (RH) conditions. Our results show that the dehydration of this mineral is unlikely under current martian surface conditions and it thus represents a potentially important H2O reservoir. Methods: Thermogravimetric analysis (TGADTA) was conducted on ~20 mg of Mg(ClO4)2.6H2O to determine the H2O content of the phases in question and to evaluate the dehydration behavior of the hexahydrate. Samples were heated from 25°C to 400°C at a rate of 2°C /min under 100% N2 atmosphere. The dehydration and rehydration behavior of the hexahydrate was also evaluated using a Hiden IGASorp-CT TGA instrument, capable of measuring H2O adsorption and desorption isotherms from ~3°C to 325°C at PH2O values from ~0 to 520 mbar. Samples prepared for structure determination via X-ray diffraction studies were mounted in a titanium cavity mount and inserted into an environmental cell equipped with an Anton-Paar TTK 450 heating stage and an automated VGen RH generator. In-situ heating and precise control of the PH2O permitted a systematic study of the dehydration products of the Mg perchlorate system. XRD data were measured from 10-150° 2θ (0.0167° steps, 10 s/step) using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with CuKα radiation and Vantec 1-position sensitive detector.   Figure 2.

Endotherms (red) were observed at 130°C, 150°C , and 230°C, correlating to the loss of 2, 4, and 6 H2O molecules, respectively.  Results: Dehydration reactions measured in the TGA confirmed three stages of dehydration, yielding the tetrahydrate, dihydrate, and anhydrate phases (Fig. 2). X-ray diffraction data taken under identical T-RH conditions confirmed these phase transitions (Fig. 3). The stabilities of the dehydrated phases are strongly PH2O dependant as shown by the IGAsorp data in Figure 4, and the hexahydrate resisted dehydration at low temperatures even under very low PH2O conditions. The hexahydrate was held under vacuum (0.15 mbar) in the XRD for 1 week at 23°C with no indication of dehydration until a temperature of at least 50°C was reached. A previously unreported pentahydrate phase was observed at these low temperatures and moderate RH, and solution of the structure of this phase is in progress. The tetrahydrate phase was typically the first to form and its appearance was also strongly RH dependant. The dihydrate phase was quite stable, resisting dehydration up to 250 °C under moderate RH conditions. Dehydration involves a systematic loss of H2O molecules, leading to structural rearrangement and a   decrease   in symmetry (Fig. 1). The removal of two H2O molecules caused a reduction in symmetry   to    C2,   with   four   H2O equatorially coordinated to the Mg2+ cation and two [ClO4]-1  Figure 3. XRD data taken at the same rate of heating as the TGA data. Clear phase transitions are observed as the hexahydrate completely dehydrates.    Figure 4.

Further dehydration to the dihydrate leads to bridging of the isolated packets to form chains of octahedra and polyhedra [10]. Complete dehydration to the anhydrous form leads to six [ClO4]-1 coordinated to the Mg2+, creating an infinite 3D orthorhombic framework.  The stability of hydrated Mg perchlorate under vacuum is surprising as it is typically considered to be highly reactive. These preliminary results indicate that Mg(ClO4)2.6H2O will be the dominant Mg(ClO4)2 phase on Mars and is unlikely to dehydrate even at the highest surface temperatures on the planet. These relatively stable hydrated salts (gypsum, perchlorate, polyhydrated magnesium sulfates) represent a potentially large reservoir of H2O trapped in the regolith that could be cycled into the atmosphere under different obliquity cycles. The distribution and quantity of perchlorate on the surface of Mars is still unknown, but if large playa-type deposits are present, they could represent a significant reservoir of H2O.
