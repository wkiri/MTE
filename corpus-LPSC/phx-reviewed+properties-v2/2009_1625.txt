The NASA Phoenix lander has provided a unique first-look at permafrost processes operating on the surface of the martian northern plains [1]. Critical results from the mission include the detection of an icy surface present beneath thin, overlying, dry sediments [1-3]; complex soil chemistry comparable to that observed in terrestrial cold and arid terrains [4, 5]; and weather/climate conditions consistent with the generation of a range of cold-desert landforms [1-3]. Questions remain, however, as to the abundance and origin of the observed ice, the history of liquid water at the landing site, the age and stability of the landing site surface, and the relationship between the landing site and the martian latitude-dependent mantle (LDM).  The martian northern plains are typical of martian LDM surfaces [6-9]. Data from Phoenix can be used to test hypotheses accounting for the origin of the martian LDM in the vicinity of the landing site by addressing questions raised by each hypothesis (indicated parenthetically): 1) Young, latitude-dependent mantle: the LDM is meters-thick and formed from precipitation of snow and dust, with dust forming a sublimation lag, and with massive ice concentrated in underlying layers [6-13] (What processes have brought pebbles, cobbles, and boulders at the site to the surface?). 2) Young, latitude-dependent mantle—wet active layer: the LDM is meters-thick and formed from precipitation of snow and dust, with dust forming a sublimation lag—subsequently, formation of a wet active layer has mixed the sediment and brought rocks to the top surface [14, 15] (Why are the ages of the Phoenix landing site [16] and northern plains LDM surfaces [7, 12, 17] considerably younger than the last predicted period of active layer activity in the northern plains [18]). 3) No latitude-dependent layer—cold climate: Circumpolar deposits are secondary ice [19]—polygons form from thermal cycling of ice-cemented sediment and boulders accumulate at the surface by long-term reworking of an old regolith (What processes account for the <1 Ma age of the LDM surface?). 4) No latitude dependent layer—wet active layer: Martian polar surfaces are actually ancient and have been enriched in secondary ice by vapor diffusion—melting has occurred in the recent geological past, causing cryoturbation of the deposits that bring boulders to the surface [1, 19, 20] (Occurring only during peak obliquity excursions [18], are active layer processes sufficient to degrade craters?). Here we present a range of observations of the Phoenix landing site from the surface stereo imager (SSI) [2] that provide insight into surface activity (cryoturbation of secondary ice versus vertical ablation of primary atmospheric ice) and thermal contraction crack polygon dynamics.     Geomorphological Observations From SSI Suggesting Stable/Vertically Ablating Surfaces. Stable (nonchurning) and vertically ablating surfaces are typical of extremely ice-rich permafrost surfaces in some portions of the Antarctic Dry Valleys—particularly those in which sublimation is a dominant water phase transition—and provide a guide to geomorphic features that may suggest stable, vertically ablating surfaces on Mars [21-24]. Pitted rocks are present at the Phoenix site, and have been interpreted as vesicular boulders (Fig. 1) [25]. Alternatively, these boulders may have been pitted by a range of surficially-acting physical processes, such as salt weathering, which typically forms mm-to-cm-scale pits on static rocks in Antarctic environments on timescales from ~1-4 Ma [22, 26-28], consistent with predictions of syngenetic LDM and boulder emplacement and arrangement [34]. Next, although preliminary cobble and boulder counts at the Phoenix site have been interpreted to indicate thorough reworking of the surface by cryoturbation [3, 20], the presence of cobbles and boulders overlying fine sediments in polygon interiors (rather than embedded in them) (Fig. 2) strongly suggests the formation of "desert pavement" surfaces, typical of vertically ablating arid surfaces [24, 29-31]. Pavement surfaces are ablational, consistent with the paucity of depositional ripples at the site reported by [25]—although light-toned, smooth "dust pools" are abundant around the lander, analogous to flat-lying sand accumulations typical of Antarctic polygonally patterned terrains [32]. Additionally linear groups of boulders and cobbles (Fig. 3) present at the Phoenix site appear analogous to the surface expression of relict polygon trough locations found in vertically-ablating Antarctic tills [30]. Lastly, tightly clustered groups of cobbles and boulders at the landing site appear analogous to disintegrated boulders (or "puzzle rocks") common in Antarctic, arid terrains—clasts that are weathering in-situ with minimal surface disturbance [27].  Ongoing Sublimation-Style Polygon Activity. Troughs emerging from polygon interiors and orthogonally intersecting polygon margin troughs (Fig. 4) indicate that the Phoenix landing site surface has undergone more than one generation of polygon trough formation, consistent with models predicting ongoing thermal contraction cracking [33]. Ongoing fracturing, preferential sublimation of buried ice at fracture locations, and periodic slumping of clasts into polygon troughs (typical of terrestrial sublimation polygons [30]) may account for polygons observed at the site with cobble/boulder-covered interiors (Fig. 5) overlying fines transitioning into troughs with finer grained rock cover.  Conclusions. Geomorphological analysis of the Phoenix landing site suggests a history for permafrost at the site characterized by the recent dominance of ice removal by sublimation, ongoing thermal contraction cracking, and limited cryoturbation by either wet or dry processes. These observations are consistent with global observations of the martian latitude-dependent mantle suggesting the vertical ablation of excess ice in the martian subsurface originally of primary atmospheric origin.
