Martian Atmospheric 80Krn Concentrations.  Neutron-capture noble gas isotopes in Martian meteorites may provide clues as to the evolution of the Martian regolith and atmosphere.  Relative to either a solar-Kr or an AVCC-Kr isotopic composition, several laboratories have reported excess 80Kr in shergottites EET79001 and Shergotty and in ALH84001 and Nakhla [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].  This excess 80Kr was attributed to neutron capture by 79Br, but interpretations differed on where it formed.  Adopting a solar composition for trapped Martian atmospheric Kr [1], these meteorites contain ~0.6-3.5 x10-12 cm3/g of excess 80Kr, or 6-19% of the total measured 80Kr for EET79001, Shergotty, and ALH84001, but  ≥50% for Nakhla.  EET79001 lithology-A contains only a few percent as much excess 80Kr as does the glass, and this amount is probably all cosmogenic 80Krc in origin.  A non-glass sample of Shergotty contained only 22% as much excess 80Kr as Shergotty impact glass.  80Krc comprises ~36-46% of the total 80Kr excess for three Nakhla samples, and ~5-12% of the excess 80Kr for four ALH84001 samples.  We conclude that the remainder of the excess 80Kr in these Martian meteorites is neutron-capture 80Krn.  Concentrations of 80Krn are 1.33.5 x10-12 cm3/g for five samples of EET79001 and Shergotty impact glass,  ~1.3 x10-12 cm3/g for Nakhla and 0.6-1.4 x10-12 cm3/g for ALH84001.  Although these meteorites contain similar concentrations of 80Krn, they may have acquired their trapped Kr at very different periods in Martian history.  Two observations indicate that the 80Krn was not produced during cosmic ray irradiation in space.  These are a correlation between concentrations of the 80Krn component and trapped atmospheric Martian Kr, and the observation that 80Krn concentrations are somewhat similar in meteorites whose space exposure ages differ by up to a factor of ~20.  Further, the 150Sm/149Sm ratio (which is sensitive to neutrons) is within uncertainty of the expected value for samples of EET79001 whole rock and impact glass, and places an upper limit of ~1014 n/cm2 on the neutron fluence seen by EET79001 as a meteorite.  In contrast, in situ production of 80Krn in EET79001 glass implies a neutron fluence of ~7x 1015 [5].  We conclude that 80Krn was introduced into these meteorites as part of the Martian atmospheric component known to be present.  This 80Krn was produced within the upper Martian regolith through capture by 79Br of neutrons produced during cosmic ray interactions.  Part of this 80Krn then degassed into the Martian atmosphere.  From data on five shergottite impact glass samples, we adopt an average fractional 80Krn excess of 9.6 ±3.6%.  When this value is combined with the total average mass of the Martian atmosphere, it yields a total Mars atmospheric inventory for 80Krn of 3.1 x10 10 g (2.3 x1032 atoms).    Calculated 80Krn Production Rate.  We modeled the 80Krn production rate in the Martian regolith in order to estimate the total inventory of 80Krn still present in the regolith and to possibly constraint the time evolution of the regolith and atmosphere.  Because adsorption of neutrons by 79Br proceeds more readily at epithermal energies, we modeled the neutron flux as a function of energy and regolith depth.  Fluxes of energetic particles arising from interactions of an isotropic cosmic ray flux were calculated using the Los Alamos LAHET Code, which transports neutrons down to thermal energy [8].  The Martian surface was modeled as a sphere of 3790 km radius, whose surface was divided into 128 concentric shells down to a subsurface depth of 500 g/cm2. Nearly all neutron captures occur in this zone. Calculations were made assuming different regolith water concentrations.    The neutron flux depends on regolith composition, because of large differences among elements in the rate at which they adsorb epithermal neutrons.  We modeled the Martian regolith using the major element composition given by [9] and the estimated minor element composition given by [10], which  assumes a Martian regolith of basaltic composition.  We used this regolith composition and the Σeff procedure developed by [11] to estimate the individual elemental cross sections for thermal neutrons.  The flux-energy distribution for neutrons in the Martian regolith are primarily determined by O, Si, Fe, and H, but the most important absorbers of neutrons are Fe and Cl, followed by Si, Al, Ca, Ti, and Br.  Because of the much lower relative abundance of Sm and Gd compared to lunar soils, the REE are not major neutron absorbers in the Martian regolith.  We obtain a Σeff of 5.27 x10-3 cm2/g and an effective cross section for capture of thermal neutrons by 79Br of 105 barns.  We used data obtained by Viking and Pathfinder and from analyses of Martian meteorites to estimate average Cl and Br concentrations of the Martian regolith.  We adopt a Cl concentration of 0.3% and a range for Br of 10-30 ppm.  These values depend on the model adopted for Martian surface deposits, and probably are the greatest uncertainty in our model calculations.  The production of 80Krn from neutron   capture on 79Br is given by 80Krn = 79Br*σ*Φ, where 79Br is the average regolith concentration, σ is the effective thermal neutron capture cross section for 79Br obtained from Σeff iterations, and Φ is the calculated flux of thermal neutrons.  Because the latter is a strong function of regolith depth, we performed this calculation over different depth intervals down to 500 g/cm2 and summed the results to obtain the total 80Krn and 36Arn production rates, the latter being produced from neutron capture by 35Cl.  The calculated average production rate for 80Krn in the Martian surface is 1.2-3.6 x1016 atoms/s (for Br= 10-30 ppm).  Dividing this range of values into the total excess 80Krn in the Martian atmosphere derived above gives a time of 180-540 Myr.  This is the total time required to produce within the Martian surface an amount of 80Krn equal to that deduced for the Martian atmosphere.  If this 80Krn production rate occurred over a period of 4 Gyr, the Martian regolith would be degassed of only ~5-14% of its total 80Krn.  Recent models of gardening of the Martian surface by large impacts suggests mixing to depths of  hundreds of meters within the first ~1 Gyr and to depths of tens of meters over the past ~3.5 Gyr [12].  If we assume an average mixing depth of 100 m, the average regolith should contain a rather high concentration of ~1 x10-9 cm3STP/g of 80Krn, depending on Br content.  By contrast, the concentration of 80Krn in EET79001 impact glass is three orders of magnitude lower.  80Krc & 36Arn Production Rates.  We estimate the global production rate of cosmogenic 80Krc in the Martian regolith to be ~7x1014 atoms/s, which is a factor of ~15-50 lower than the global 80Krn production rate.  Thus, an excess 80Kr component in Martian atmospheric gas due to cosmogenic production on Mars is not expected to be observable, and such a component has not been seen in trapped Kr in Martian meteorites.  The calculated production rate of 36Arn (assuming average regolith Cl= 0.3%) is 5.5 x1018 atoms/s, or ~6.6 x1035 atoms over 4 Gyr.  (The 38Ar production rate from 37Cl is lower by a factor of ~300.)  The present Martian atmosphere contains ~1.5 x1036 atoms of 36Ar, which is only a factor of 2.5 larger than the amount of 36Arn produced over Martian history.  If all of this 36Arn were still retained in Martian regolith well mixed to an average depth of 100 meters, the 36Arn concentration in the regolith would be high, ~1 x 10-6 cc/g.  The efficiency of 36Arn diffusive loss from the regolith into the atmosphere cannot be estimated as it was for 80Krn, because the Martian atmosphere has lost significant amounts of Ar over time, resulting in mass fractionation of the atmospheric 36Ar/38Ar ratio [13].  Significant diffusive loss of 36Arn from the regolith into the atmosphere could affect models of Ar isotopic fractionation during atmospheric loss, as these models assumed starting 36Ar/38Ar ratios like solar or AVCC.  Unlike Ar, Kr is not lost from the Martian atmosphere.  Implications for Mars.  Cosmogenic noble gases produced in meteorites and lunar regolith, especially Kr and Xe, have high retention efficiencies against diffusion loss,.  The estimated ~5-14% 80Krn loss from the Martian regolith may reflect loss not from silicate rock, but from halogen-rich salts concentrated in the regolith, from which diffusion may occur more readily.  The concentration of 80Krn and 36Arn in various regolith samples returned to Earth for analyses might place constraints on the average mixing depths of the regolith and might constrain the timing of Br concentration at the Martian surface.  If most of the halogens were brought to the Martian surface by early (i.e., >3.5 Gyr ago) processes such as volcanic activity or dissolution and precipitation from liquid water, then the production rates of 80Krn and 36Arn are expected to have been relatively constant over Martian history.  On the other hand, if halogens have been brought to the surface at an approximate constant rate, then the production rates of 80Krn and 36Arn will have increased proportionally over Martian history.  If shergottite glass and ALH84001acquired their atmospheric Kr <0.2 and ~4 Ga ago, respectively, then the similarity in excess 80Krn concentrations between the two meteorites suggest that most 80Krn production occurred early in Martian history.  This might imply that Br was concentrated at the surface early on, and that Mars was absent a large atmosphere for at least part of its early history.  In principle, comparison of the calculated 80Krn production rate against measured average concentrations of 80Krn in the Martian regolith could constrain the fraction of Martian history in which a massive atmosphere shielded the surface from cosmic ray production of 80Krn, just as the Earth�s surface is shielded.  Our derived 80Krn production rate combined with shergottite glass data only requires that the Martian atmospheric pressure was low for ~0.5 Ga of Martian history.  However, if the Martian regolith contains substantial quantities of 80Krn, then Mars is required to have had low atmospheric pressure for a much longer period.  References. [1] D. Garrison & D.
