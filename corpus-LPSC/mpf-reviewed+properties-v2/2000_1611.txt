Introduction. The reflectivity spectra of Martian bright regions are similar to those of certain palagonitic tephras [e.g., 1]. Because palagonite is the hydrated and oxidized alteration product of basaltic glass, the correspondence in reflectivity spectra implies that glass formation was is an important Martian surface process. On the earth, basaltic glass is produced by volcanic and to a lesser extent impact processes. Some studies [e.g., 1, 2] have argued that production of glass by volcanic and especially impact processes might be enhanced on Mars relative to the earth. Formation of impact glass from melting of Martian soil likely will occur. On the basis of Viking and Pathfinder analyses, the majorelement composition of Martian soil can be represented by a locally perturbed global average compostion [1]. Thus, a synthetic glass made from the composition of Mars global average soil (MGAS) will approximate the composition of impact glass made from soil anywhere on the planet. In order to be able to recognize or exclude the signature of soil-derived glass in Martian remote sensing data, we prepared synthetic glasses from melts equilibrated at several oxygen fugacities using the volatile-free (i.e., SO3-free) composition of MGAS published by [1] and characterized them by X-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic techniques, iron Mössbauer spectroscopy (FeMS), visible and near-IR spectroscopy (VIS-NIR), and thermal emission spectroscopy (TES). A volatile-free composition is appropriate for glass derived by melting of Martian soil because the solubility of sulfur is low in silicate liquids [e.g., 3]. Synthesis and Methods. Approximately 40 g of glass (sample MGAS1-AIR) was synthesized by thorough mixing of appropriate quantities of dried reagent-grade oxides, melting at 1300 °C for 4 hr in an iron-saturated Pt crucible, and quenching in water. The target and actual major element concentrations of the glass are given in Table 1. Three additional ~1 g samples of glass (MGAS1-CO2, -QFM, and -IW) were prepared in one atmosphere, gas-mixing furnaces by equilibrating samples of the MGAS1-AIR glass at 1300 °C for 16 hr at three different oxygen fugacities defined by pure CO2 and the quartz-fayalite-magnetite (QFM) and iron-wustite (IW) reaction curves and quenching in air [4]. XRD, magnetic, FeMS, and VIS-NIR measurements were done on fine powders (<150 µm) using procedures described by [1], and TES measurements were done on 1-3 mm powders using procedures described by [5, 6]. X-ray diffraction and magnetic properties. The XRD spectra of the four glasses are very similar (Figure 1a) with no apparent systematic dependence on oxygen fugacity. All are characterized by a very broad peak (width ~12° 2θ) centered near 27° 2θ. The two most oxidized glasses (MGAS1-AIR and -CO2), however, have several small, broad peaks that correspond to peak positions for magnetite. The presence of magnetite, a strongly magnetic mineral, provides the explanation for the factor of 10 higher low-field magnetic susceptibility for MGAS1-AIR and -CO2 (5.9x10-6 and 4.3x10-6 m3/kg) compared to MGAS1-QFM and -IW (both 0.3x10-6 m3/kg). Approximately 1 % magnetite is required to account for the difference in magnetic properties, assuming a value of 400 x10-6 m3/kg for fine-grained magnetite [e.g., 1].  Table 1.

Mössbauer spectroscopy. In compliance with the decreasing equilibration oxygen fugacity, the amount of Fe3+ decreases in the series MGAS1-AIR > -CO2 > QFM > IW (Figure 1b). At the highest (MGAS1-AIR) and lowest (MGAS1-IW) oxygen fugacities, iron is present as mostly tetrahedrally coordinated Fe3+ and virtually only octahedrally coordinated Fe2+, respectively. The results are consistent with previous Mössbauer studies of glass [e.g., 7]. Visible and near-IR spectroscopy. The reflectivity spectrum of MGAS1-IW (Figure 1c), which contains predominantly octahedrally coordinated Fe2+ by Mössbauer spectroscopy, is characterized by two broad bands centered near 1100 and 1850 nm that result from Fe2+ crystal field transitions in an octahedrally distorted site [e.g., 8]. The band positions are equivalent to those reported previously for Fe2+ in synthetic low-Ti glass prepared under reducing conditions [e.g., 9, 10]. The two Fe2+ bands are still present in the MGAS1-QFM glass, but the reflectivity is greatly reduced shortward of ~1000 nm. This reduction results from absorption by MARS GLOBAL AVERAGE SOIL GLASS:  R. V. Morris et al.  Fe3+ alone (crystal field transitions) and by Fe2+ - Fe3+ intervalence charge-transfer transitions (IVCT), which occur below 1000 nm in crystalline silicate compounds. Resolvable Fe3+ crystal field and Fe2+ - Fe3+ IVCT transitions are not observed in the two most oxidized samples, presumably because of large width-toseparation ratios. The manifestation of Fe3+ is increased absorption in the region shortward of ~1000 nm. We infer that the presence of optically black magnetite in MGAS1-CO2 and -AIR also lowers their albedo with respect to the other two glasses and would act to reduce the spectral contract of Fe3+ transitions associated with the glass. The variation with oxygen fugacity that we observed in reflectivity spectra for our MGAS1 composition is equivalent to the variation reported by [9] in absorption spectra for a low-Ti basaltic composition. -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 Velocity  (mm/s) MGAS1-AIR MGAS1-CO2 MGAS1-QFM MGAS1-IW tet-Fe(3+) oct-Fe(2+) (b) FeMS (c) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.5 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 Wavelength  (x1000 nm) Ref le ct iv ity 1100 nm 0.3 0.1 MGAS1-IW -QFM -CO2 -AIR 1850 VIS-NIR MGAS1-AIR 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Degrees 2θ (Cu Kα Radiation) (a) -CO2 -QFM -IW 27.0 deg. 2θ 2K cpm χ lf = 5.9 x 10-6  m 3/kg    4.3 x 10 -6 Mt XRD    0.3 x 10 -6    0.3 x 10 -6  Thermal Emission Spectroscopy. The thermal emission spectra of the four glasses are essentially identical (Figure 1d) and thus not dependent on the oxidation state of iron. Emissivity minima located near 1000 and 440 cm-1 correspond to two broad features; both have spectral contrasts of ~0.1. As shown in Figure 1e and in agreement with literature data [e.g., 11], both positions occur at lower energies compared to more SiO2-rich compositions. Also note that the spectral contrast (~0.4 vs ~0.1) and band sharpness of obsidian glass are much greater compared to MGAS glass. Thus the detectability of MGAS glass will be reduced compared to SiO2-rich glasses in linear mixing models that are employed to deconvolute thermal emission spectra of the Martian surface [e.g., 12]. 0.80 0.82 0.84 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98 1.00 1.02 200400600800100012001400 Em is si vi ty (0.00) (-0.03) (-0.06) (-0.09) MGAS1-AIR -CO2 -QFM -IW 1000 cm-1 440 cm-1 (d) TES 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00 20040060080010001200 Wavenumber  (cm-1) Em is si vi ty MGAS1-AIR, -CO2, -QFM, and -IW Obsidian Glass 1080 cm-1 470 cm-1 (e) 1000 cm-1 440 cm-1 1400 TES Figure 1.
