Introduction: On Mars, the geomorphology of numerous surface features has been attributed to the interaction of magmatic and impact heat sources with an H2O-rich Martian crust/megaregolith [1-3].  In addition, geochemical analyses of soil at the Pathfinder and Viking landing sites indicate high concentrations of SO3 and Cl [4-6], consistent with interaction between a basaltic protolith and fluids rich in acidic sulfate and chloride species.  Such fluids are often found in association with subsurface hydrothermal systems and crater lake environments in terrestrial settings [7, 8].  These factors have led to the suggestion that hydrothermal alteration of the Martian crust may have been partially or wholly responsible for the production of the chemically unique sedimentary deposits observed on the Martian surface [9-11].  However, the secondary mineral phases formed via alteration of the Martian regolith under hydrothermal conditions relevant to Mars remain largely unconstrained [12-14]. The few relevant experimental hydrothermal studies published to date have emphasized the conditions of formation of alteration minerals observed in the Shergottite-Nahklite-Chassigny class of meteorites [15-17].  Given the exceedingly small volume of the observed alteration mineralogy, and the shock-related thermal history of these meteorites, there remains considerable doubt as to how much can be inferred about bulk Martian soil properties from these unique samples [18].  Thermodynamic modeling of hydrothermal alteration under conditions relevant to Mars has been performed utilizing only deionized water equilibrated with variable pCO2 as the simulated solvent [19, 20].  To date, these types of studies have generally ignored other fluid compositions that may be of considerable importance in Martian hydrothermal systems, such as acid-sulfate and sulfate-chloride type fluids [9, 21]. The results presented herein represent the first in a series of experiments aimed at assessing the role that hydrothermal systems might play as a source of secondary minerals at the Martian surface.  Utilizing the flow through reactor described in Tosca et al. [22], two successful experiments have recently been completed.  In addition, four batch-type experiments will be initiated shortly.  These experiments simulate the lowtemperature (epithermal) alteration of a synthetic Martian basalt by an acidic sulfate-chloride type fluid; an analog to the near surface environment peripheral to a hydrothermal system. Experimental Procedures: A unique and important component of this research project will involve synthesis of the host-rock materials to be utilized during hydrothermal alteration experiments.  Studies of terrestrial hydrothermal systems indicate that at temperatures ≤ 280 0C, host-rock composition exercises clear control over the secondary mineral assemblages formed as a result of hydrothermal alteration [23]. Griffith and Shock [20] concluded, on the basis of thermodynamic modeling of hydrothermal alteration under conditions relevant to Mars, that the chemical and mineralogical characteristics of the modeled hostrock is "the most important factor" controlling the final assemblage of secondary minerals produced in their simulations. Basalt Synthesis: Two batches of synthetic crystalline basalt were prepared for use in the recently completed and upcoming set of alteration experiments. Basalts were prepared utilizing a mixture of oxide components designed to match the chemical composition of the Los Angeles meteorite (Stone 1) [24].  This mixture of oxide components was heated above the liquidus (T≅1135oC) in Au80Pd20 tubing (housed in a vacuum-sealed silica tube), and subsequently cooled to a final temperature of 955oC before quenching in order to produce a crystalline basaltic rock sample.  Synthetic basalt samples were characterized by petrographic examination, electron microprobe, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Flow Through Experiments: In preparation for loading into the flow-through reactor, synthetic basalt samples were lightly crushed, and the grain size ranging from 125-710 µm (medium to fine sand) separated by sieving.  Ultrafine particles were subsequently removed by sonicating in acetone, and the samples dried overnight at 60oC.  The 125-710 µm fraction was then loaded into two flow-through lines housed in the reactor system, which was preheated to a temperature of 75oC.  Sample Line #1 was loaded with 53.4 mg of basaltic sample, and Sample Line #2 with 64.3 mg. Fluid (T=75oC) was injected into the sample lines by syringe pump at a flow rate of 3.5 µL/min.  For Sample Line #1, a total of ~7 g of fluid was pumped through the sample chamber, resulting in a water-rock ratio (WR) ≅ 130. For Sample Line #2, a total of ~47 g of fluid was pumped through the sample chamber, resulting in a WR ≅ 730.  Effluent samples were col Hydrothermal Alteration of the Martian crust:  J. A. Hurowitz et al.  lected in separate aliquots and placed in refrigerated storage for later analysis. The injected fluid was prepared by mixing deionized water with reagent-grade H2SO4 and HCl, resulting in a solution with the composition 0.24M H2SO4, 0.045M HCl.  This composition is modeled after crater lake fluids found in terrestrial settings such as Mt. Ruapehu, NZ [7].  The molar S: Cl ratio of this mixture (5.3) is also nearly identical to the average molar S: Cl ratio of Martian soil (6.2). Following completion of flow-through experimentation, samples were removed from the flow-through reactor and washed with ethanol using a bottletop vacuum filtration unit.  This was done in order to remove residual acid from the solid sample, thereby preventing further reaction from occurring after experiment completion.  Approximately half of the reacted solid sample was then separated and ground using an agate mortar and pestle.  The resultant sample powder was mounted on a petrographic slide using standard smear mounting techniques for XRD analysis. Preliminary Results: Synthesis resulted in basalt samples dominated by pyroxene (~46%), plagioclase (~38%), titanomagnetite (~7%), silica (~4.5%), and Krich residual glass (~4.5%).  Clinopyroxene compositions range from Wo14-39En5-48Fs15-79.  Plagioclase compositions average An58Ab41Or1.0.  Titanomagnetite compositions range from Usp11-37Mt63-89.  Co-existing oxide, clinopyroxene and SiO2 equilibria suggest an ƒO2 of -0.75 to +2.1 ∆FMQ at 955 oC. These results compare to a Los Angeles meteorite composition having pyroxene (43.7%), plagioclase (44.8%), titanomagnetite (2.1%), silica (2.4%), and Krich felspathic glass (1.6%) [24].  Los Angeles clinopyroxene compositions range from Wo12-41En50-6Fs8133, plagioclase compositions range from An50-62Ab3748Or1-4, titanomagnetite compositions range from Usp67-72Mt22-32, with a predicted ƒO2 of -1 to -2 ∆FMQ at 900 - 950oC [25]. Results of XRD analysis on reacted samples from the flow-through experiments described above indicate that no new mineral phases were precipitated during the course of experimentation.  The primary mineral phases pyroxene, plagioclase, and titanomagnetite were readily dissolved, leaving a residual solid composed largely of primary silica, particularly at high WR. Future Work: Effluent samples collected during the course of experimentation will be analyzed for dissolved cation and anion concentrations by emission spectroscopy (DCP-AES) and ion chromatography, respectively.  This will allow for the prediction of mineral saturation states within the reacted fluid samples at experimental temperatures (75oC); as well as a characterization of the nature of basalt dissolution within the experimental hydrothermal system (i.e.: stoichiometric vs. non-stoichiometric dissolution). Further fluid geochemical modeling will involve evaporation simulations that utilize the effluent compositions derived from the first set of flow-through experiments.  Mineral phases precipitated as a result of evaporation of fluids found in Martian crater lakes or hydrothermal fluid seeps may form an important component of the Martian soil deposits, which are thought to be enriched in salt components such as MgSO4, MgCl2 and NaCl [26, 27]. Upcoming experiments will most likely be performed as batch type experiments in screw-top Teflon beakers at 75oC, under a wider range of WR (10, 50, 100, and 500). These experiments will be performed in attempt to promote precipitation of mineral phases that would be expected to form in the nearsurface epithermal zone of a Martian hydrothermal system.  Such mineral phases could be incorporated into Martian soil deposits by a variety of erosive mechanisms, e.g., see Refs [1, 2, 3]. References: [1] Tanaka, K., et al. (2002) GRL 29, 1-4.
