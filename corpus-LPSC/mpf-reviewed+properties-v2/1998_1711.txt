Mars Pathfinder landed on the Ares Vallis landing site on July 4, 1997. Besides being an engineering mission, it carried a payload of several science instruments that returned  a large quantity of scientific information. The Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) was designed to provide the chemical composition of martian rocks and soil. The APXS has benefited enormously from the presence of a rover because it  provided mobility and enabled it to analyze many rock and soil samples selected from the IMP and rover images. The APXS is a complex instrument with three modes of operation and provides three different energy spectra. Data from these three modes are partially complementary and  partially redundant. The alpha mode is particularly useful in the detection  of the  light elements C, N, O while the proton mode contributes  to the accuracy of the intermediate Z elements Na, Mg, Al, Si and S. The X-ray mode can detect all the elements above Na. Due to a need for a re-calibration of the alpha and proton modes at the measured  martian pressures only the results from the X-ray mode are reported here. The results from the alpha and proton will provide information on the presence of carbonates on Mars and will also help to reduce the uncertainties associated with some elements. All three modes of the APXS instrument performed well during the entire period  of operation on the surface of Mars and provided high quality data. The performance of the X-ray mode was best during  night time measurements when the ambient temperature of the surface was very low. The low Martian temperature and the extremely good stability of the electronics of  the X-ray system contributed enormously in obtaining high resolution  X-ray spectra. A temperature variation of more than 100 °C during the data accumulation produced a shift in peak position smaller than a fraction of a channel.

However, not all have been analyzed yet. Samples were selected by the science team  from the images returned by the lander and rover cameras. The actual navigation to the selected sample and the deployment of the APXS to a particular sample was done by  rover personnel. It turned out that the navigation and accurate deployment of the APXS was more difficult than was initially expected. Several times the intended sample was missed completely or  several tries were required for proper positiong. The procedure for the data analysis started with  conversion of  the APXS binary data into an ASCII format and a quick look at all the X-ray spectra on a PC display screen. The data files from the same sample were analyzed individually or combined together for better counting statistics. The ASCII  files were then inputted into a least-squares fitting program that subtracted the background, found all the peaks present in the sample and calculated the peak areas and their uncertainties. Fig. 1 shows the decomposition of the X-ray spectrum from the Scooby Doo sample into individual elemental contributions. All pertinent peaks are identified and labeled. These data were subsequently fed into an X-ray fundamental parameter  program that calculated the elemental abundance. Another quick way of analyzing the APXS Mars data was to use calibration curves of peak areas vs concentration for each element that was obtained by analyzing terrestrial samples of known composition during the APXS calibration at the laboratory.  The results of analyses then were normalized to 100% assuming that there is no water, carbonates or nitrates in any of the analyzed samples. Presently, oxygen is assumed to occur in stoichiometric proportion with the oxide forming elements, but it will be determined later directly  from the alpha data.

Higher Mg, S and Cr on the soil is clearly visible as compared to the rock. THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF MARTIAN ROCKS AND SOIL:  T. Economou et al. Fig. 2  is a comparison of the raw X-ray spectra from the rock Wedge and the dark soil Mermaid Dune. This comparison shows clearly that the soil contains more Mg, S, Ti, Cr and Fe. Cr appears to be present at the level of 0.3% only on the soil samples but not detected on any of the rock samples. Table 1 shows the preliminary results of analyses of the X-ray data for six soil and five rock samples. A more detailed description  of the results and their interpretation is given in [1].  Especially surprising in the APXS analyses is the finding  of high silica content on all of the rocks at Ares Vallis Pathfinder landing site. The significance of this evidence is explained by Wänke in [2]. The soil samples on the Pathfinder site closely resemble those on the two Viking sites separated apart by several thousands kilometers [3]. That would imply that most of  the soil on Mars is of the same composition.  There are, however, small differences among them that will become  more pronounced after the error uncertainties will be better understood. Most of the rocks on Mars seem to be covered, to some degree, by dust that precludes the  analysis of a pristine rock. We have tried to minimize this effect by selecting  to analyze rocks with the smallest amount of dust contamination. The alpha spectra  of the APXS are somewhat affected by the CO2 gas in the Martian atmosphere. However, after subtracting the gas contribution, preliminary data analysis of the alpha spectra indicate that there is no evidence that carbonates  are present  on any of the analyzed samples.
