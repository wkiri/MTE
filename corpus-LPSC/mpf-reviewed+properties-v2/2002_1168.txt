Introduction: A consortium has recently been initiated to study the macroscopic and microscopic properties of basaltic and andesitic rocks as analogue materials for Mars. The goal of this project is the integration of diverse spectroscopic approaches to evaluate the composition and texture of Mars materials using both in situ and remote sensing techniques. Initial emphasis is placed on assessment of the mineral composition for low albedo areas (basalt vs andesite vs weathering) of the Martian surface through spectral analysis of a suite of samples that have been exceptionally well characterized in the laboratory. The surface mineralogy on Mars holds information about the climatic and geochemical record. The spectral properties of bright and dark regoliths on Mars have been summarized by [1] and [2].  The chemical and mineralogical compositions of the rocks near the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) lander suggest that they are andesitic-basaltic and locally derived, and that many rocks are covered with alteration rinds [3].  Analysis of TES data has distinguished two types of rock compositions, described as basaltic and andesitic [4, 5, 6, 7]. Our objective is to build a diverse set of multidimensional data that will allow these and subsequent interpretations to be tested across independent techniques. Results: Initial consortium analyses have been completed on selected samples from a suite of basalts for which seven particle size separates have been prepared along with initial compositional analyses [8]. These prepared materials have been made available to our consortium in order to initiate coordinated analyses. The basalts are from the Miocene Vogelsberg Figure 1. Composition of pyroxenes in three basalt samples (G1, G2, G3) [8]. volcanic complex in Germany and the bulk modal mineralogy has been characterized [8]. Composition of the pyroxenes present in these basalts are shown in Figure 1. Bidirectional reflectance spectra (0.3 to 2.6 µm) were obtained for three particle size separates (250500, 63-90, <25 µm) of two of the Vogelsberg basalts (G1 and G2) along with spectra of a cut surface of the same sample. All spectra were obtained at a viewing geometry of i = 30° and e = 0°. These spectra were spliced with biconical reflectance data (see below) to illustrate the hydrous bands near 3 µm, and the results are shown in Figure 2. This near-infrared (NIR) part of the spectrum is sensitive to the character of mafic mineralogy. Both basalts exhibit absorption bands due to pyroxene near 1 and 2 µm. The bulk mineralogy of basalt sample G1 contains significantly more olivine than does G2, whereas G2 has a greater abundance of plagioclase and pyroxene. 0 . 0 0 0 . 1 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 G1 Feuerbach slab G2 Wilhelmsbad slab Wavelength (µm) 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 G2 <25 µm G2 63-90 µm G2 250-500 µm G1 <25 µm G1 63-90 µm G1 250 -500 µm 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 Ref le ct an ce Figure 2.

Thermal emittance spectra were obtained for the cut surfaces of basalt samples G1 and G2 and are shown in Figure 3. Biconical reflectance spectra were obtained for three particle size separates (250-500, 6390, <25 µm) of G1 and G2. These spectra are shown in Figure 3 with the reflectance data inverted for comparison with the emittance data. Except for the edge of the Reststrahlen band near 8 µm, the emittance and reflectance data exhibit consistent features for the large particles and cut surface (the Reststrahlen band edge is particularly sensitive to the specular component of biconical reflectance).  The fine particles exhibit additional features at wavelengths below 8 µm and in the transparency  feature region [9] near 12 µm; both are associated with a stronger volume component of the radiation. 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 400800120016002000 G1  slab G2  slab Em is si on Wavenumber (cm - 1) 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 G2 <25 µm G2 63-90 µm G2 250-500 µm G1 <25 µm G1 63-90 µm G1 250-500 µm 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 In ve rs e R ef le ct an ce Wavelength (µm) 5 10 2086 12 157 5030 0 . 0 Figure 3.

Room temperature Mössbauer analyses were performed for two size separates (<25 and 250-500 µm) for the G1 and G2 basalt samples and the results are shown in Figure 4. Spectra of both basalts have prominent peaks assigned to ilmenite; its abundance does not change in the different size fractions.  What does change, however, is the amount of Fe 3+ in the silicates and glass; note the increased intensity in the low velocity area of the spectra in both basalts.  This increased Fe 3+ is probably the result of proportionally more fine-grained Fe 3+ -rich clay minerals (e.g. smectite) in the smaller size fraction.  The other notable difference between these spectra arises from the presence of olivine in G1, which results in increased intensity of the largest quadrupole splitting doublet (visible especially on the high velocity peak of the doublet, which is located around 2.5 mm/s). 4 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 0 4 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 0 - 1 0 1 2 3 G2 <25 µm G2 250-500 µm G1 <25 µm G1 250-500 µm Ab so rp ti on ( %) Velocity (mm/s) Fe3 + Fe2 + Fe3 + Fe 2 + Fe2 + Ilmenite Fe 2 + Ilmenite Fe 2 + Fe2 + &Fe3 + Fe2 + &Fe3 + Fe2 + Figure 4 .

Our initial results indicate that the visible/NIR reflectance spectra, mid-IR reflectance and emission spectra, and Mössbauer spectra contain consistent diagnostic features associated with the measured modal mineralogy and provide baseline data for our first group of well characterized basalts. Our consortium study involves integrating multiple remote sensing techniques for recent and upcoming missions to Mars in order to compare the results obtained by these instruments and thereby strengthen interpretive results.
