Introduct ion Elysium Mons (24.8°N, 146.8°E) has unusually steep upper flanks and a narrow summit, with a single, almost circular caldera ~13.5 km in diameter [1 2].  Its morphology is similar to that of Emi Koussi volcano in Tibesti, Africa [3].  Crater counts from Viking Orbiter images show that the Elysium Mons summit is older than the Tharsis volcanoes [4].  Elysium Mons is also unusual in having at least 18 sinuous channels on its flanks [5] within 50 km of the caldera rim, these being either aligned collapse craters (presumably collapsed lava tubes) or open lava channels.  Here we use data from Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) to analyze one of the largest of these lava channels, which is located on the northern rim of the summit caldera (at 25.0°N, 146.8°E). 2.  Lava Channel  Geomorphology The channel can be divided into four main segments. (1) Within 1 km of the caldera rim, the channel is degraded with several impact craters on the floor.  The observed width is 444-528 m and shadow length measurements indicate a depth of ~50-65 m.  The degradation state suggests this to be a remnant of an earlier phase of activity and not directly related to the formation of the main channel.  (2) 1.5 km from the caldera rim, the channel becomes deeper (75 to >133 m) and wider (up to 870 m).  This segment is ~1.8 km long and we interpret it to be the vent area of the main channel.  (3) Between 3.3 and 9.0 km from the rim, the channel progressively narrows but has a uniform morphology, with an observed width of 550 m (depth > 84 m) near the vent to 267 m width (depth > 36 m) at the distal end.  We interpret this to be the main segment of an open lava channel.  (4) At 9.13 km from the caldera rim, the channel bifurcates and then becomes discontinuous.  A series of aligned pits and channel segments, each ~150-255 m wide and ~25-40 m deep, extend to a distance of 18.6 km from the caldera.  We interpret this to be the region where the open channel started to form a roof, and created a lava tube that has subsequently partially collapsed. MOLA profile #11235 crosses the summit of Elysium Mons and shows that the southern caldera rim is at an elevation of 13.658 km, with the northern rim at 13.933 km.  The floor of the caldera is relatively flat at an elevation of ~13.577 km, and these values imply that the caldera volume is about 34 km3.  The MOLA profile crosses the northern rim of the caldera ~2 km to the west of the channel under study here but, by assuming that the topography of the summit is symmetric at the scale of a few kilometers (an inference supported by our examination of other MOLA profiles which cross parts of the volcano), we can estimate the local gradient of the surface into which the channel was cut: 8.5° for the proximal "old" part of the channel, 10.0° for the vent area, 8.9° for the main part of the channel, and 7.1° for the distributed channel. 3.  Numerical  Model  of  Channel  Formation The morphology of this channel suggests that it was formed by thermal erosion, as is believed to be the case for sinuous rilles on the Moon [6, 7], komatiitic channels on early Earth [8, 9], and long sinuous channels on Venus [10, 11].  Thermal softening of the surface beneath a turbulent lava flow and subsequent mechanical erosion of material form a channel into which the lava flow progressively subsides.  Field evidence on Earth implies that the process has operated to varying degrees in a number of cases [12] and theoretical modeling [13, 12, 14] emphasizes that the process is most pronounced when the lava effusion rate and temperature are high, the lava viscosity is low, and the ground over which the initial flow moves is steep and has low mechanical strength. Our analysis uses the theoretical model of Hulme [15].  We require the width W and depth D of the channel, and the slope α of the ground over which the precursor flow moved.  We measured the present-day width of the channel from MOC images and inferred its present-day depth from shadow lengths.  We approximated the preeruption flank slopes of the volcano from the nearby MOLA profile.  The channel currently has a V-shaped profile along almost all of its length due to postformation weathering, and the sides have nearly uniform slopes from ~10-29°.  We estimated the original width by reconstructing the walls to be vertical and then subtracting twice the current depth of the channel.  This correction is needed because the channel walls would have been undercut by thermo-mechanical erosion due to the moving lava, which acted at the side-wall contacts as well as at the floor contact between lava and bedrock.  In the vicinity of the inferred vent region we find the width to be W = ~200 m and the depth to be D = ~100 m. The theoretical analysis requires an estimate of the depth H of the flowing lava in the bottom of the channel as it was eroded.  This would have been similar to the thickness of the channel-forming flow prior to the onset of erosion.  The only way to estimate the thickness of the precursor flow is to assume the volume eruption rate and rheological properties of the lava.  To avoid making such assumptions we take a series of plausible values for the lava depth H and explore the consequences.  A lava flow with thickness H and bulk density ρ (taken as 2000 kg m -3) moves down a slope α under gravity (g = 3.74 m s-2  on Mars) with speed U where: U  =  (g ρ H2 sin α) / (3 η) (1) if the lava motion is laminar and U  =  [(2 g H sin α) / f]1/2 (2) if the lava motion is turbulent. f is a friction factor (~10-2 [16]) and η is the lava viscosity, ~1000 Pa s [17] for the  ERUPTION CONDITIONS AT ELYSIUM MONS, MARS:  L. Wilson and P. J. Mouginis-Mark basaltic to basaltic-andesite compositions suggested by the Pathfinder-Sojourner mission [18, 19].  We shall shortly show that the lava forming the channel was probably turbulent, and so equation (2) gives U as a function of H and the viscosity is irrelevant. Multiplying U by the lava depth H we obtain Q, the volume flux per unit width of flowing lava, and multiplying Q by the channel width W we obtain the total lava volume flux.  We next evaluate the heat fluxes from lava to substrate due to viscous dissipation (G) and conduction in the laminar boundary layer in contact with the ground (C).  These are [15] G  =  g ρ Q sin α (3) and C  =  [k (Ti - Tz)] / [β (4 κ t) 1/2] (4) where k is the thermal conductivity of the substrate rocks (~2 W m-1  K -1); Ti is the lava-substrate interface temperature, taken as a plausible solidus temperature of 1373 K; Tz is the ambient Martian surface temperature (~200 K); β is a constant [15]  equal to 12.6; κ is  the thermal diffusivity of substrate rocks (~10-6  m2 s -1); and t is the time since a given batch of lava left the vent. If U is relatively constant with position along the flow, t = (X/U).  The rate of erosion of the substrate rocks E is E  =  (G + C) / [ρ c (Tm - Tz)] (5) where c is the specific heat of the lava (~1000 J kg-1  K-1) and Tm is the temperature of the magma on eruption (for which we use the liquidus temperature of a basalt, 1428 K).  Finally the duration of the eruption, τ, equals (D / E), and multiplying τ by the volume eruption rate F gives the total erupted lava volume V. Table 1 shows how the mean flow speed (u), lava volume flux per unit flow width (Q), total lava volume flux (F), total heat transfer rate into the substrate (G + C), erosion rate at one km from the source vent (E1), time to erode the observed depth of the channel near the vent (τ) and total erupted lava volume (V) vary with the value assumed for the depth of flowing lava, H.  Whereas u, Q, F, G, E1 and τ all change significantly with H, V approaches a maximum as H increases.  Clearly the total erupted lava volume must be no more than about 40 km3 and is unlikely to be less than ~20 km3.  The volumes of 59 lava flows, found mainly on the distal NW flanks of Elysium Mons, were estimated [20] to lie between 18 and 68 km3, implying that the event studied here is entirely typical of eruptions on this volcano. We can use the properties of the 59 distal Elysium flows to constrain eruption conditions during the event studied here.  Photoclinometric flow thicknesses of 4060 m on slopes averaging 0.95° were found [20].  The thickness of a lava flow is determined by the thickness of its lateral levees which is in turn determined by the yield strength, Y, of the cooled lava forming the levees: Y  =  ρ g H sin α (6) Using ρ = 2000 kg m-3 , α = 0.95°, g = 3.74 m s-2 and H = 40 to 60 m, we find Y = 4960 to 7440 Pa.  These values are very similar to those (4800 to 6000 Pa) measured [21] for terrestrial basalts near their eruption temperatures.  If this range of values of Y is relevant to the flow we are studying, it would imply that the expected thickness of the flow on a 10° slope would be 3.8 to 5.7 m.  Table 1 then implies a total lava volume of 33 to 36 km3 erupted at a rate ranging between 5000 and 15000 m3/s in an eruption lasting between 80 and 26 days. References [1] Pike, R. J., Proc.
