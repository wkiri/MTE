Summary:  The Astrogeology Science Center of the U.S. Geological Survey has performed stereotopographic mapping of candidate landing sites for every successful Mars surface mission.  Here we describe our contributions to site selection for the upcoming InSight lander (2016 launch) and Mars 2020 rover missions. Background: The critical importance of topographic and slope data to the process of selecting a safe landing site has been understood since the first soft landers were sent to the Moon and planets, but the quantity and quality of such information that is available has increased dramatically over the last decades. Our involvement in landing site mapping began with the Mars Pathfinder mission, for which we used 40 m/pixel Viking Orbiter images to produce a contour map covering most of the landing uncertainty ellipse with a 100 m contour interval [1]. Elevations at most points in the ellipse had to be interpolated from contours on the order of 10 km away, so we also used photoclinometry (shape from shading) [2] to make digital topographic models (DTMs) of small areas with 40 m/post grid spacing. By the time of the Mars Exploration Rovers site selection, both 3 m/pixel Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images and software for digital or "softcopy" stereo mapping were available, allowing us to produce stereo DTMs with 10 m/post spacing, supplemented by photoclinometric DTMs at 3 m/post [3]. Because stereo coverage was extremely limited, the strategy adopted was to identify the main terrain types with distinct geomorphic, roughness, and thus hazard characteristics and attempt to produce a DTM of at least one sample of each unit [4]. Mapping in support of the Phoenix mission initially followed the same pattern, but 0.25-0.3 m/pixel images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (MRO HiRISE) became available late in the process, allowing us to sample key locations with 1 m/post stereo DTMs [5]. Given the limited HiRISE stereo coverage, it was fortunate that the candidate Phoenix sites were relatively uniform in their morphology.  The initial mapping of Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) sites [6-7] also involved sampling multiple candidate ellipses with one HiRISE (or, in one case, MRO CTX [8]) stereopair.  After downselection to four candidates, we were able to map 75-95% of each 25 x 20 km landing ellipse with 5-7 HiRISE pairs. After Gale crater was selected as the landing site, another 7 pairs were added to fill gaps within the ellipse and cover the scientific target area on the northern flank of Aeolis Mons.  The extensive overlaps between the DTMs collected for MSL allowed us to assess the precision, accuracy, and resolution of HiRISE stereo DTMs. Methodology: Our approach to stereomapping with HiRISE images (described in detail in [4]) is summarized here. Stereo coverage is obtained by imaging the same target on two different orbits, with the MRO spacecraft rolled off its normal nadir orientation on one or both orbits to provide convergent viewing, typically at angles of 20-30°. Data obtained by the 10 red-filtered CCD detectors, which provide the widest cross-track field of view, are used for stereo processing. The individual CCD images are radiometrically calibrated and "balanced" in brightness and contrast at the HiRISE Operations Center (HiROC) [11]. The USGS software system ISIS [12] is used to resample and combine the CCD images into a single 20,000-pixel wide image, correcting for the relative offsets and rotations of the CCD segments and optical distortion. This step can also be used to correct image distortions that result from rapid angular motions ("jitter") of the spacecraft. Such motions must first be modeled by tracking common features in the overlaps between adjacent CCDs, a process known as the HiRISE Jitter Adjusted Camera Kernel (HiJACK) pipeline [13]. HiJACK processing is generally used only if the angular motions exceed 2 to 3 pixels (2-3 µRad), the level found to interfere with stereo matching [5]. Before this jitter-correction process became available, it was necessary to request the acquisition of a new HiRISE stereopair in cases where the initial pair exhibited jitter of this magnitude. Adaptive Fourier-domain filtering of the images usefully suppresses "cloth like" noise patterns that occur under conditions of high atmospheric opacity and low signal to noise ratio, eliminating the need to reacquire these images as well. Once the CCD images are distortion-corrected and combined in a mosaic, the resulting full-swath image and its trajectory and pointing history are output from ISIS in formats understood by BAE Systems SOCET SET ® software. This commercial stereoanalysis package is then used to control the images, create the DTM by automated image matching, and interactively edit the DTM. Control is based on Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data [15], but no longer relies on interactive measurement of features that can be identified in both the HiRISE and MOLA data sets as described in [4].  Instead, we collect a low resolution uncontrolled DTM and use surface fitting [16] to align it with the MOLA surface, effectively transforming unconstrained image tiepoints into ground control points. The module pc_align of the Ames Stereo Pipeline [17] has proven highly effective for this purpose. Because of the high resolution and signal/noise ratio of HiRISE, the need for DTM editing is minimal and is usually restricted to shadows, smooth featureless areas, and a few of the steepest slopes. Processing of CTX stereopairs generally follows the approach outlined for HiRISE, but is simpler because the camera has a single CCD array and it is not necessary to assemble data from multiple detectors. Unfortunately, this also means that the HiJACK approach cannot be applied to reconstruct and correct for jitter based on comparison of the detector overlaps. Where necessary, we digitally filter the DTMs to suppress washboard-like ripples caused by acrosstrack jitter [cf. 3], but it is not possible to correct the horizontal distortions that also result. Fortunately, these are small enough (meters to tens of meters) that they do not greatly affect the usability of CTX-derived products. Data Products: The main products generated for each stereopair are a DTM at a post spacing of 3-5 pixels (1 m/post for HiRISE, 20 m for CTX), and orthorectified (i.e., projected onto the DTM to remove parallax distortions) versions of each image at the DTM spacing and at the approximate scale of the source imagery (0.25 m/pixel for HiRISE, 6 m for CTX). To facilitate landing simulations, products are delivered to the project upon completion as ISIS "cube" files and GeoTIFFs, in Equirectangular projection with planetocentric latitude type, center latitude 0°, scaling based on the equatorial radius of Mars, and heights expressed as radii. HiRISE DTMs and orthoimages are subsequently archived in NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) format and with slightly different cartographic parameters as described in [18]. Supplementary products include maps of adirectional (downhill) slope computed from the DTMs over 1x1, 2x2, and 5x5 m squares for HiRISE and 100x100m squares for CTX; colorcoded slope maps at reduced resolutio, and page-sized "layout" figures showing the image and color shaded DTM with scale, graticule, and annotation. Once all DTMs requested for a given site (including Mars Express HRSC DTMs at 50 m/post or greater [19] as well as the products described here) have been generated, we will produce final DTM mosaics. To ensure optimum accuracy and consistency of the data, we will use surface fiting to adjust the positon and tilt of each DTM to match the nexthighest resolution coverage (i.e., HRSC will be fitted to MOLA, CTX to HRSC, and HiRISE to CTX). This process was demonstrated for MSL [20] but was hampered by residual distortions in the CTX products (since corrected) and the limited tools then available for DTM fitting. The end result is to reference all data sets to the MOLA base, which provides a well-understood conversion from inertial space in which the spacecraft are flown into cartographic space on the surface of Mars [4]. InSight: This Discovery mission will use a Phoenix-like tripod-type lander to carry out geophysical (seismology, heat flow, and precision tracking) investigations of the martian interior [21]. Scientific and basic engineering (elevation and latitude) criteria were met by 22 sites in southern Elysium Planitia, which were downselected to 4 in the summer of 2013 [22]. We were selected in February 2014 to produce a total of 22 HiRISE and 6 CTX DTMs of these sites.  Because of the relatively large size (130 x 27 km) of the InSight ellipses, the mapping strategy is (a) to sample all distinct terrain types [23] in the ellipses (Fig. 1), determine the likelihood of mission success for each sample, and use maps of the distribution of these units to calculate the overall success rate for each ellipse; and (b) to use point photoclinometry [24] to estimate slopes throughout each ellipse, relying on multiple stereo DTMs distributed across each ellipse to "calibrate" these estimates for the varying effects of atmospheric haze.  Figure 1. Terrain hazard unit map of part of the InSight landing zone in southern Elysium Planitia, showing the four current candidate sites (bold numbers; yellow, blue, and white ellipses reflect the orientation of the landing approach for beginning, middle, and end of the launch window) and the 11 HiRISE DTMs analyzed to date. Colors correspond to terrain units mapped by [23]. DTMs are designated by the ellipse number and a positional indicator (e.g., W for west, EC for east central, FE for far east).  Equirectangular projection centered near 0°N, 137°E, north at top. Data from two CTX pairs and 10 HiRISE data packages were delivered in 2014 (Fig. 1). These DTMs cover 8 of 11 terrain units identified in the region [23] with extensive sampling of the extensive smooth unit (green in Fig. 1).  As indicated in Table 1, root mean squared (RMS) slopes for most of these units fall in the range spanned by the MER and MSL landing sites or at most fractionally rougher.  Only on the rims of major craters (red in Fig. 1) does the RMS slope approach 10°.  Given that both landing and instrument deployment are likely to fail on slopes greater than about 15°, the crater rim terrain is clearly a significant hazard.  Fortunately, it occupies only a small fraction of the candidate ellipses. These initial results make it likely that the ultimate choice of landing site will hinge on small differences in the abundance of steep crater rims and the local roughness of the smooth terrain unit between the ellipses, as well as the varying abundance of hazardous rocks, which are mostly associated with small, fresh craters and in etched terrain.

We have since produced two additional HiRISE DTMs and two more are currently being edited. In addition, two completed and two partial (first image only) HiRISE stereopairs have been acquired.  Priorities for analyzing these data sets (as well as others yet to be acquired) will be revisited in the near future after downselection to one or two ellipses.   Mars 2020: The next Mars rover will be based on the MSL design, including its delivery by "sky crane," and will explore an "astrobiologially relevant" site to determine its past history, habitability, and ability to preserve biosignatures [25].  As a result, a diverse set of 9 candidate sites are currently being considered. The USGS was selected in July 2014 to produce CTX DTMs. Two sites (Mawrth Vallis, Holden crater) were previously mapped as candidate MSL sites [6-7]. The NE Syrtis and Nili Fossae sites have received the highest priority for topomapping, and we are preparing one CTX and one HiRISE DTM of each, with first products to be delivered in mid January. HiRISE stereopairs have been identified (at lower priority) for the McLaughlin crater and Margaritifer sites and a CTX pair is available for one of two ellipses in Melas Chasma.
