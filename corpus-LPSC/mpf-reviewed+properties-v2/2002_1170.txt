 ROCK COATINGS AND ALTERATION RINDS; HOW THEY MIGHT FORM ON MARS AND WHAT THEY CAN TELL US.  J. L.

Introduction: Recent magnetic, chemical, spectral and imaging data from Mars Pathfinder suggest that surface alteration and/or weathering has taken place on Mars and that there may be coatings on the rocks resulting from these processes [1, 2, 3, 4].  Spectral analyses of laboratory materials are underway in this study in order to understand processes resulting in rock coatings on Mars. Particulate fines may become cemented onto rock surfaces causing changes in the spectral properties. Spectral studies of thin layers of fines on surfaces have shown that the composition and thickness of the layer can have a large effect on the spectral properties of the substrate [4, 5, 6, 7]. A variety of rock coatings have also been observed on the Earth that may provide insights into coating mechanisms on Mars.  These include colored, glassy surfaces on black volcanic glass, hard black coatings or desert varnish  formed  on  quartzite or  basaltic rocks, and alteration rinds formed on volcanic rocks.  These kinds of coatings are under study here. Shown in Figures 1 and 2 are reflectance spectra of some examples of  fine-grained analogue materials  for 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Alt. Pillow <2 µm Pal.

The spectra displayed in green and blue are mixtures from a recent lab study [8].  Two mixtures containing iron oxides, silicates and sulfates were exposed to wet/dry cycling experiments in the lab.  The spectra shown here are of the loose and crusted versions of these samples. Shown in orange and red are altered volcanic fines from Iceland [9].  These samples are the <2 µm particle size fractions of the altered rind from a pillow lava and a subglacial palagonitic tuff.  Spectra are also shown for a fine-grained bright red ash from a cinder cone on Haleakala (pink spectra); this sample contains hematite, maghemite, jarosite and some clay minerals [10].  The spectra shown in purple are of a mixture of fine-grained magnetite, maghemite, ferrihydrite and montmorillonite. Shown in Figures 3 and 4 are reflectance spectra of some examples of rock coatings that may have applications to Mars.  The spectra displayed in the top portion of these figures are of desert varnish and parents  rocks  from  Arizona  and  Nevada  [11].   The 400800120016002000 Mg-Mh-Fh Mont. (synth.) Hal.

The spectra shown in the lower portion of Figures 3 and 4 are of smooth, colored coatings on volcanic glass, as well as the fresh glass and ground versions of this glass, collected from the Mauna Iki region of Hawaii. Applications to Mars.  Spectral analyses of Mars soil analogues, cementation processes, and rock coatings formed under a variety of conditions are underway in this study in order to gain information about the composition and formation mechanisms of rock coatings on Mars.  The 2003 MERs will be providing new spectral data of rocks for the regions ~0.4-1.0 µm (PANCAM) and ~400-2000 cm -1 (MiniTES).  It will be important to have lab spectra linking these two datasets.  Omega (2003) and CRISM (2005) will also be measuring visible/NIR spectra of progressively smaller spatial regions and may enable better resolution of the altered phases than has been possible to date with TES. 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 2Parent rock from Nevada Parent rock from Arizona desert varnish Wavelength (µm) 5 6 7 8 10 15 20 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 2 0 . 0 4 0 . 0 6 0 . 0 8 Hal.
