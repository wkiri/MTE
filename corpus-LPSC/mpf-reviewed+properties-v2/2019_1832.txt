Preliminary research on martian surface of supposed target areas (Oxia Planum and Mawrth Vallis) is necessary for successful landing of the module. This investigation includes exploration of physical and physico-mechanical soil properties which is based on new martian soil simulant.  Materials and methods: Spirit, Opportunity, Pathfinder, Viking missions provide in-situ data on physical and physico-mechanical properties of martian soils which became a basis of our research [1]. We created 4 mixtures of easy-to-find desintegrated components such as quartz sand, fly-ash and ash-slag waste (ASW) based on quantitative estimates of the prevalence of different types of terrain (Tables 1 a-c, 2 a-d).  Table 1a. Martian soil properties (density and particle size distribution) expected at the landing sites of Oxia Planum and Mawrth Vallis. Chemical composition of all components (except clay) are basalt-like. The percentage of soil components was estimated by analysis of high-resolution images of the sites [1, 2] Soil components Density, g/cm3 Grain size, mm Percentage, % Oxia Mawrth Silt 1-1.3 0.0010.01 2-7 2-7 Sand 1.1-1.3 0.06-0.2 22-27 8-13 Crusty to Cloddy 1.1-1.6 0.005-0.5 32-37 22-27 Blocky 1.2-2.0 0.05-3 26-31 20-25 Pebbles 2.6-2.8 2.0-2000 5-10 13-18 Clay 1.5-1.6 <0.001 0-3 20-25 Table 1b.

Grain-size distribution; . Dry and particle density; . Cohesion; . Angle of internal friction; . Moisture content. Physico-mechanical properties were obtained in triaxial and direct shear tests.  Results: According to results of our experiments, mixture #2 (Table 1c) seems physico-mechanically similar to martian soil. Its density in loose state is 1.3 g/cm3 (Table 2d), that is close to upper bound of martian silt and sand soils' density estimations (~1.3 g/cm3) (Table 1a). The mixture's density in compact state is 1.55 g/cm3 (Table 2d), which corresponds to the density range for clay, crusty to cloddy and blocky martian soil density intervals (Table 1a). Low moisture of the mixture is typical for upper part of martian soil in ExoMars mission's target areas [3]. Besides, stiffness modulus, elastic modulus, bearing capacity, dynamic elastic modulus, dynamic modulus were measured, but there are no estimates of these properties of real martian soil. We propose Mixture #2 for drop-tests of ExoMars landing module.   Table 2a.
