 THE TRUE COLOR OF YOGI: AN ACCURATE METHOD FOR REMOVING DIFFUSE ILLUMINATION FROM MULTISPECTRAL IMAGES OF MARS Carol Stoker and  Kathy Rages M.S. 245-3 NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, cstoker@mail.arc.nasa.gov, krages@mail.arc.nasa.gov Background: The apparent color of surfaces on Mars is strongly influenced by the color of the light illuminating them. Martian scenes are illuminated by both direct sunlight and diffuse skylight caused by the scattering of sunlight by dust particles in the atmosphere. This diffuse illumination is reddened compared to the solar spectrum and is a substantial fraction of the total illumination [1]. For example, Figure 1 shows the rock Yogi taken at two times of day.  The color differences between the center and right faces (points A and B on Fig. 1) in the morning image were interpreted [2] to be evidence that the East face of Yogi, which faces the mean wind, was relatively free of an oxidized coating. Abrasion due to wind-carried particles might be the mechanism for removal of the coatings.  However, Thomas and others [1] argued that the apparent color of Yogi can be fully explained by variations in the relative amounts of direct and diffuse light on the different faces of the rock. Thus, it is important to account for and remove the effects of illumination conditions to correctly interpret reflectance spectra obtained from a Mars lander or rover. Figure 1    .  Images of Yogi taken at 9:00 (left) and 15:00 (right) showing the change in appearance at different illumination conditions. Methods: We have developed an accurate method for removing the effects of diffuse illumination which uses a doubling-adding radiative transfer computer code to model the direct (solar) and diffuse (sky) illumination of surfaces as separate contributions to the total reflected light intensity. The method can be used to produce spectra as they would appear if there were no dust in the atmosphere, provided we know the scattering geometry and the light scattering and absorption properties of the atmospheric dust and the surfaces.  We are applying our method to interpretation of multispectral images obtained from the Mars Pathfinder IMP camera. Diffuse illumination is produced by the scattering of sunlight by atmospheric dust which we model using the values for the particle size, complex refractive index, and optical depth reported by [3]. The modeling also requires knowledge of the incidence and reflectance angles and phase angle. These, in turn, require detailed knowledge of the 3-D position and orientation of the surface.  The difficulty of obtaining this information has previously prevented accurate correction of spectra for diffuse illumination [1]. We use threedimensional models of the terrain derived from stereo images using the methods described by Stoker and others [4] to compute the normal to the surface for each considered point, and from these compute the scattering geometry. Results: To study the effect of varying illumination conditions on Yogi, and to illustrate our method for retrieving true color, we constructed a geometric model which roughly approximates the shape and position of Yogi rock by a truncated dodecahedron, placed at an azimuth of 330 o from an observer.  The reflectance properties were represented as Lambertian with Albedo=1.   The light scattered into the direction of the observer for each visible surface was calculated for  9:00, 12:00 and 15:00 local solar time on July 20, 1997 at the Pathfinder latitude on Mars. Figure 2 shows the model as it would appear on a dust free Mars, at the three times of day.  Table 1 shows the ratio of radiances in red  (670 nm) and blue (440 nm) channels.  The diffuse (sky) illumination is a substantial contribution to the total illumination of all faces at all times.  Also, the diffuse illumination is substantially redder than the solar spectrum.  Even though the direct (sun) illumination is somewhat blue, as a result of passage through the atmosphere and preferential extinction of red light by dust, the total illumination on all faces is always redder than the solar spectrum due to the diffuse illumination. Figure 2.     Geometric model  of Yogi as it would appear at three times of day illuminated by the sun with no dust in the atmosphere. The facets 1-4 in Table 1 are labeled on the 9:00 AM model. We used our radiative transfer code to investigate whether the color differences between points A and B on Yogi are true color or illumination effects. Using 3D models deduced from a stereo pair of Yogi acquired  THE TRUE COLOR OF YOGI  C. Stoker and K. Rages in the Superpan imaging sequence, we determined the surface normal and scattering geometry for the points A and B. We analyzed a multispectral sequence of Yogi acquired at four times of day.  We determined an equivalent Lambert Albedo for Yogi at these two points by dividing the calibrated image radiance by the radiance of a Lambert surface with unity Albedo tangent to the rock surface at these points and illuminated by our Mars lighting model.  Results are illustrated in Table 2.  We conclude that point B is less red (and by implication less coated with bright red dust) than point A. Table 1.

This corroborates the conclusion of McSween and others [2] that coatings of bright red material, probably dust, are responsible for the red color of rocks at the Pathfinder site.  The method we applied to Yogi can be performed quickly and provides an efficient way to produce spectral products which are independent of illumination conditions.  This method should be applied to interpretation of other multispectral image products from Mars Pathfinder and to the upcoming Mars Exploration Rover as it eliminates the ambiguities in the interpretation of spectra obtained under differing illumination conditions. Plans:  The method we used to interpret the color of Yogi still has the simplification of not accounting for the wavelength-dependant scattering phase function of the surface.  We plan to show results  using a Hapke model for the surface reflectance properties.  With surface properties modeled, we can produce "true color" spectra, that is, spectra as they would appear on Mars without atmospheric dust. References: [1] Thomas, N. et al., J. G.
