Introduction:  During the early Martian history, volcanic emanations contributed large excesses of volatiles including halogens, sulfur and water to the Martian crust.  These chemically-reactive elements had undergone extensive redistribution over time due to a variety of surface processes on Mars [1].  To understand the nature of the alterations due to aqueous activity in the Martian surface environment, a study of halogens, in particular Cl/Br ratios in secondary mineralization products may provide valuable insights. Dreibus and Wänke [2] arrived at a Cl/Br ratio of ~110 for the Martian surface materials by studying glasses and bulk samples of several SNC meteorites using neutron activation. Nakhla probably offers the most diverse suite of aqueous precipitates to be found among the SNC meteorites. Numerous veins of hydrous clay within olivine grains are present in Nakhla [3,4]. Bridges and Grady [5] and Wentworth and McKay [6] observed massive concentrations of halite of probable Martian evaporitic origin, in association with siderite and anhydrite in interstitial areas in Nakhla.  Dreibus et al. [7] reported Cl/Br ratios in 3 Nakhla fragments from 104 to 550 and found that 90% of the Cl and Br was readily leachable from this material. Their Nakhla leachate ratio was 580.  Their analysis of an attached salt grain yielded a ratio of 5440, similar to that in table salt.  Xirouchakis et al. [8] found 20 ppm Br in glass veins in Los Angeles shergottite based on XRF measurements with the xray microprobe (beamline X26A) at the Brookhaven Nat. Lab.  We examine in this study whether a Cl/Br ratio similar to that of [2] is also present in products of secondary mineralization, generated as a result of aqueous alteration in some SNC meteorites.  We have studied the Cl/Br ratios in fracture-filling materials in veins  in Nakhla olivines  (thin sections) by determining Br contents using the X-ray Microprobe facility [9] at GeoSoilEnviroCARS (Advanced Photon Source/University of Chicago) and by determining Cl using SEM-based EDX measurements at the same sites in the veins.  Samples:  The Nakhla specimen consisted of a 30 micrometer thick section on glass prepared at NASAJSC. This thin section was prepared from the Nakhla sample obtained as a part of the consortium studies organized by Monica Grady by using minimal amounts of aqueous solvents.  Previous work on this filling material with electron-based techniques had produced semi-quantitative concentrations for other elements including Fe and Cl.  An attempt was made here to conduct the synchrotron x-ray fluorescence measurements on the same (as well as adjacent) spots analyzed previously.  Electron micrographs were available for this registry purpose.  X-ray microprobe analyses were made on the thin section �as-is�.  X-ray Microprobe Analysis:  The X-ray microprobe at the GeoSoilEnviroCARS (http://gsecars.org)  consisted of an APS undulator X-ray source, silicon (111) cryogenic monochromator, Kirkpatrick-Baez microfocusing mirrors [10] and a germanium solid state fluorescence detector.  An X-ray beam 3 µm in diameter was used.  XRF maps in �region-of-interest� mode were made of the areas of interest, followed by collection of full XRF spectra on high Br concentration spots.  Dwell times for the latter were typically 5 minutes. As the Nakhla thin section was prepared on a conventional glass slide, there was a high fluorescence background from impurities in this material.  Fortunately, the Br fluorescence from the glass was small compared to the signal from the alteration material (<10%) and a correction for this background could be readily made. Bromine concentrations were computed using Fe as an internal reference element.  Because the X-ray beam penetrates the entire thickness of the thin section, the Fe fluorescence measured at each spot derives not only from the weathering material but also potentially from the underlying host material (olivine).  For accurate Br content determinations, knowledge of the proportions of these two phases in the analysis volume is required.  The average Fe content along the beam trajectory was obtained from the ratio of the Fe fluorescence at the spot to that from the adjacent olivine (50% FeO; [3]).  The Fe content of the weathering material was nearly constant in these regions as determined by EDX (Region 1 = 16.8 wt % Fe, Region 2 = 17.0 wt % Fe).  These Fe contents fall at the low end of the range observed by Gooding et al. [3], for the compositions which they interpreted as likely smectites.  The proportion of each phase in the beam was then computed from this average Fe content and Fe contents of the two  NAKHLA CHLORINE/BROMINE:  S. R. SUTTON ET AL.   phases (endmembers).  This approach allowed bromine concentrations in the weathering materials themselves to be computed.   Results and Discussion:  Elemental maps were obtained for three distinct fracture zones containing weathering material and were denoted Regions 1-3.  Figure 1 shows these maps for Regions 1 and 2.  It can be seen that there is a negative correlation between Fe and Br, i.e., Fe is more concentrated in the host olivine and Br only occurs in the fracture filling material.   Table 1 summarizes the bromine concentrations which ranged from 96 to 215 ppm with a mean value of  151 ppm and standard deviation of 49 ppm.  The Br background measured from the olivine itself, representing the contribution from Br in the glass substrate, was equivalent to 10 ppm and the data have been corrected for this background.   Chlorine concentrations for Regions 1 and 2 (0.88 and 0.68 wt %, respectively) shown in Table 1 derive from  EDX measurements on the same regions by Rao et al [1].  For Region 3, the average Cl concentration of the other two regions (0.8 wt %) was used ( Cl contents of the Nakhla weathering material in this thin section varied only at the ~20% level). The Cl contents used here agree well with those of Gooding et al. ([3]; 0.66 wt % average).   The resulting Cl/Br ratios ranged from 37 to 71 with a mean of 55 and standard deviation of 13.  These ratios are about a factor of two lower than the ~110 value arrived at by Dreibus and Wänke [2] for shergottite meteorites and glasses. The difference between the Cl/Br ratio of 55 deduced in this study for the Martian aqueous alteration products in Nakhla olivine veinlets and the Cl/Br ratio of 104 measured in the bulk sample [7] and of ~110 determined by [2] for the basaltic shergottites is statistically significant. Based on Viking X-ray fluorescnce measurements on Martian soil, Clark and Baird [11] estimated a value of ~100 ppm Br for the Martian soil.  Using the Cl content of 0.6% for the Martian soil based on Pathfinder measurements [12], we obtain a ratio of ~60 for the Martian soil.  This value is in agreement with the Cl/Br ratio of 55 determined for the aqueous alteration products in Nakhla olivine veinlets in this study. Our mean Cl/Br ratio is about a factor of 5 lower than the modern terrestrial seawater value of about 290 and the Earth�s crust of 280 [13].  These results show that the secondary altered material in Nakhla veinlets and grain boundaries is pristine, extraterrestrial and akin to the Martian soil.  References: [1] Rao M. N., et al.
