Detailed knowledge of the mineralogy of the Martian surface can provide important constraints not only on geological processes but also on climate evolution and exobiological potential. Current data on Martian mineralogy stem from the study of SNC meteorites and, indirectly, from chemical analyses carried out by the XRF and APXS instruments aboard the Viking 1&2 (V1, V2) and Pathfinder (MPF) missions, respectively. The detection of S and Cl on the Martian surface by V1, V2 and MPF, together with the strong correlation between the S/Si and Cl/Si ratios (Fig. 1) strongly suggest that evaporite minerals constitute an important component of the Martian surface [1,2,3] where Mg and Ca sulfates are probably the dominant species [2,4]. Figure 1.-  Correlation between S and Cl contents of Martian rocks and soils, suggesting an evaporitic component A variety of mechanisms are possible for the production of S- and Cl-bearing evaporite minerals, including evaporation of liquid water in a low-humidity atmosphere and/or sublimation of ice to a cold trap. In either case, the formation of concentrated brines is likely to have occurred on the surface of Mars [5, and references therein]. Sulfur contents in Martian rocks (0.3-1.6 wt.% MPF site) are significantly lower than in soil materials (2.7-4.9 wt% V1 site, 4.1-6.1 wt% V2 site, and 1.62.7 wt% MPF site), indicating that soils are the source of such possible evaporite component and S contents of rocks are probably due to the presence of a thin layer of "contaminant" dust covering their surfaces. Seasonal dust storms have undoubtedly contributed to the mixing and chemical homogenization of unconsolidated surface materials at a global scale, as evidenced by compositional data from V1, V2 and MPF. However, an exception to this rule is illustrated by the variability of the S/Cl ratio in the soils analyzed in these three landing sites, with average values of 4.4, 10.7 and 3.6, respectively. This variability may be due to differences in proximity of the different landing sites to sources of evaporite materials. Potential locations where evaporite deposits may form have been identified on the surface of Mars; specifically, at least 5 Martian impact crater paleolakes (including closed-, open-system and lake chain basin types) have been reported to possibly contain evaporites [6,7,8]. Terrestrial brines are commonly dominated by chlorides, since sulfates are removed by a variety of processes such as bacterial reduction leading to sulfides. There is however an interesting case (Eddy Co. Brine, New Mexico; [9]) where the S/Cl ratio reaches an exceptionally high value of about 4.5, comparable to those measured on the Martian soils. Mg-sulfates are probably the dominant evaporitic component in the Martian surface (see discussion in [2]). Calculations carried out in this work from available V1 and MPF data, assuming that all sulfur is in the form of sulfates, yield values of 24.8±5.5 and 37.0±3.0 wt.% MgSO4·7H2O (epsomite) in the analyzed soils. Given the important exobiological potential of evaporitic deposits (e.g. for the identification of halophile bacteria), identification of such materials should be a priority in Mars exploration programs. Such potentially high concentrations of epsomite (or related Mg-sulfates) in the Martian soils can, in principle, be detected from orbit through mid-IR spectroscopy. Major Martian IR absorption features for sulfate and bi-sulfate species appear at wavelengths of 8.7 and 9.8 µm [10]; the IR spectrum for epsomite unsieved coarse powder shows the most prominent absorption feature at 9.0 µm [11]; this is unfortunately close to the CO2 9.2 µm absorption band and, consequently, ���� ���� ���� ���� ���� ���� 6�6L ���� ���� ���� ���� ���� ���� &O� 6L 03) VRLOV 03) URFNV 9 LNLQJ VRLOV 5� ���� IN-SITU XRD STUDIES OF MARTIAN SURFACE EVAPORITES:  A. Cid, I. Casanova and L. Marinangeli makes sulfate detection from orbit very difficult due to the Martian atmosphere. The chemistry measured XRF and APXS during previous missions to Mars yielded rich information on certain aspects of Martian materials, but cannot constrain the exact mineral assemblages and, as a result, neither the genesis of the rocks or soils. Therefore, in order to assess the Martian environment in which the rock or soil was produced, we need to perform analyses of the mineralogy of the material. For this purpose, we propose an X-ray instrument for mineralogical analysis of planetary surface materials (XMAP). XMAP is based on an innovative miniaturized system that combines X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques in order to obtain an accurate petrologic characterization of geological samples. XMAP will perform a non-destructive analysis and sample preparation is not required. It consists of an Xray source, a sample holder and a CCD detector. The same X-ray source and detector can be used for combined XRD and XRF analyses. The geometric assemblage is robust but with a low weight (less than 2 kg) and can be constrained in a very small volume. The analytic range of the instrument depends upon the type of X-ray source and resolution of the CCD detector. A high range of minerals can be discriminated, from clays or phyllosilicates, characterized by high interplanar lattice spacing, to oxide and carbonates or evaporites. This sample spectrum can greatly enhance the sample characterization capabilities for exobiological exploration of the Martian surface. Data are analyzed and processed using the Rietveld method, in order to provide a quantitative measurement of the minerals present in Martian soils. References: [1]Clark B.C. et al.
