Introduction:  The isotopic ratios of 15 N/ 14 N,  38 Ar/ 36 Ar, and 22 Ne/ 20 Ne deduced for Martian atmosphere (from lander measurements and from measurements on impact glass in SNC meteorites) show large differences from those determined for Earth's atmosphere.  For nitrogen the isotopic differences are ~60% and for argon and neon the isotopic differences are ~30% and ~20% respectively [1].  Carbon and Oxygen in Martian atmosphere and some surface samples also show isotopic differences compared to Earth, though their magnitudes are smaller.  In these Martian volatiles, heavier isotopes are enriched relative to the lighter ones when compared to those in the terrestrial atmosphere.  During the evolution of Martian atmosphere over planetary time-scales, the observed elemental and isotopic fractionation are the result of thermal and non-thermal escape processes to space, impact erosion, outgassing and photochemical reactions.  Recently, [2] showed that lighter isotopes in Martian volatiles such as Ar and Ne could be lost to space from atmospheric exobase due to the impact of O + ions picked up and accelerated by the magnetic field of the impinging solar wind.  This may be partly aided by other non-thermal escape processes which result in large enrichment of heavier isotopes in the remaining atmosphere.  In the case of 15 N/ 14 N, the loss by both sputtering and photochemical escape seem to produce the required amount of fractionation  [2].  Based on the known isotope systematics of Martian volatiles, we make some inferences regarding S isotopes in Martain atmosphere and regolith.  First, we deduce the Ne isotopic composition to constrain the isotopic fractionation factor for Ne in Martian atmosphere.  For this purpose, we use the step-wise heating data obtained on EET79001, 27 impact melt glass inclusion [3,4,5].  The 20 Ne/ 22 Ne data for different temperature runs are plotted against 40 Ar/ 36 Ar in Fig.1.  We use the Martian atmospheric 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratio of ~2000 determined by us [6] and others [7].  We have not considered the low temperature steps (plotted in Fig.1) as they yielded 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratios close to the terrestrial atmospheric value.  We have concentrated on the high temperature data points where large amounts of trapped Martian atmospheric gases were released.  These high temperature data points in Fig.1 seem to fit to a line connecting two end members, one being Martian atmosphere ( 40 Ar/ 36 Ar = 2000) and the other being a mixture of Martian Ar and Chasigny-type (Martaian mantle) Ar [7].  For comparison, we plotted the stepwise heating Ar and Ne data of EET79001, Lith A obtained by  [4] in Fig.1.  Note that 1500 °C data point of [3], the 1600 °C data point of [4], and 1030 °C data point of [5] plot close to the Lith A tie-line (horizontal line near the bottom of the figure). This indicates that some amount of noble gases from Lith A were assimilated into Lith C glass during impact.  We also plotted (Fig.1) data obtained in the vacuum crushing experiment on EET79001,27 by [8]. The first crush (C) seems to have yielded mainly terrestrial atmospheric ratios whereas the repeat crush (Cr) seems to yield gases of Martian atmospheric composition (Fig.1.).  Based on the line joining the high temperature data points in Fig.1, we deduce the Martian atmospheric 20 Ne/ 22 Ne ratio to be ~8.      Using this Ne ratio for Martian atmosphere, we estimate the Ne isotopic fractionation factor between Mars and Earth to be 9.8/8.0 = 1.22, i.e. ~22% enrichment of the heavier isotope in Martian atmosphere compared to that in terrestrial atmosphere.  The data presented here confirm the large enrichment of the heavier isotopes in Ar and Ne in Martian atmosphere [2].     We address below some points of relevance to the fractionation of S isotopes in Martian atmosphere and regolith.  S is abundant on the surface of Mars (Viking and Pathfinder results) though it is a minor constituent in Martian atmosphere.  The SO2 abundance (upper limit) in Martian atmosphere is estimated to be ~0.1 ppm and H2S was found to be ~200 ppm [9].  In the Martian upper atmosphere S, SO, SO2 and SO3 species commonly exist.  It is expected that SO2 undergoes photolysis producing SO which will be recycled back to SO2 (the recombination reaction is rather fast) and there would be a net production of H2SO4 [10].  Among these sulfur species, SO is of interest here as the scale heights for Ar and SO may be approximately similar near the Martian atmospheric exobase.  Recently, [2] have shown that pick-up ion Sulfur isotope fractionation on Mars:  M.N.Rao, D.S.McKay & C.Schwandt  sputtering has efficiently separated the lighter isotopes of Ar from the heavies at the exobase and solar wind permanently removes them from the Martian atmosphere. A similar mechanism could have operated on sulfur isotopes near the Martian atmospheric exobase, resulting in the enrichment of heavy sulfur isotopes in the remaining atmosphere. Subsequently, this gets mixed with lower atmosphere and the signature of the heavy isotope enrichment is finally deposited into surface materials on Mars.  Elemental sulfur also could have played a similar role in this isotopic separation.  Also, such a mechanism could have operated for Ne isotopes on Mars.  In addition, other processes such as mass-independent fractionation, as result of photochemical reactions on sulfur species, could have contributed to the isotopic separation to some extent [11. Recently, [12] and [13] have carried out detailed sulfur isotopic measurements on sulfide sulfur in some Martian meteorites.  It may be important to make sulfur isotopic measurements on sulfate sulfur in samples of regolith origin in Martian meteorites to find out the base line for sulfur isotopes in Martian atmosphere.
