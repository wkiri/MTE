These data are also consistent with the presence of hydrated minerals in the Martian meteorites [11,12]. Bound water could be associated with palagonite-like silicate material and associated minerals (smectites, zeolites), as well as with salts (sulfates, chlorides, and carbonates) that could account for as much as 20 vol. % of the Martian soil [13]. Seasonal changes of the surface temperature [14] and atmospheric water content [15,17] are responsible for the formation of seasonal polar ice caps and also affect stabilities of minerals with respect to their hydration and dehydration [16]. The emission feature at 6.1 µm, which is attributed to bound molecular water, is observed in the ground-based thermal emission spectrum of Mars [4], in TES (on Mars Global Surveyor) spectra [22], and at the landing site of Spirit (MER-A). The data obtained with TES can be used to observe the global distribution of this spectral feature on the Martian surface. Here we report results of global mapping of bound water distribution on Mars at various seasons based on the TES data. Methodology: We analyzed the long wavenumber range of TES emission spectra where the distinct emission signature of the bound water is located at 1640 cm-1 (~6.1 µm). We define a bound water index as BWI = [(E1629 + E1640)/2] / [(E1618 + E1650)/2], where E is emissivity at the certain wavenumber. A BWI map was created on the base of TES mapping-orbit, nadirpointing and daytime data with maximum value of the dust and water ice opacity of 0.2 and with brightness temperature > 230K. The mapped BWI was binned at four pixels per degree with linear interpolation filling of the gaps between nearest bins. Mapping results: The planet-wide mapping reveals remarkable variations of the BWI as functions of latitude and season. These variations can be illustrated by two global maps of BWI averaged for the spring-summer seasons in the northern (Ls = 0°-180°) and southern hemisphere (Ls = 240°-360°), as shown in Figure 1. During the summer seasons in each hemisphere, bound water dominates within the high latitude belt near the edge of the permanent polar cap. In winter seasons, bound water becomes abundant in the middle latitudes near the edge of the seasonal polar cap and it fades away after the retreat of the seasonal polar caps.  We do not see any correlation of BWI with the cloud belt that encircles the planet in the tropics during northern late spring and summer [17]. The observed diminishing of the BWI could be interpreted in terms of dehydration of surface minerals over a time scale of several months. In turn, the appearance of the bound water feature at the edges of growing seasonal polar caps indicates rapid hydration of surface materials. The mapping reveals that the bound water emission is much more intense in the summer season in the northern hemisphere than during summer in the southern hemisphere. This corresponds to significantly higher abundances of atmospheric water vapor in the northern spring-summer season [15,18]. In fact, higher partial pressures of H2O increase the stability of hydrated minerals and decrease rates of their dehydration. Discussion: The results imply the existence of waterbearing surface minerals in a belt surrounding the edge of seasonal ice caps in both hemispheres, and that these minerals are able to dehydrate and hydrate over the course of the Martian year. Stability of hydrated minerals on Mars (e.g., salts) generally mimics the seasonal stability changes of water ice, as inferred from thermodynamic analyses [16, 19] based on Viking's surface temperature [14] and the atmospheric H2O abundance [15]. Hydrated minerals are stable at higher temperatures than ice is, which allows their existence beyond the edges of seasonal ice caps. During the winter season in each hemisphere, highly hydrated minerals (e.g., MgSO4·7H2O, Na2SO4·10H2O, MgCl2·6H2O, CaCl2· 6H2O, CaSO4·2H2O) are stable at lower latitudes. In summer seasons, when seasonal ice caps sublimate, less hydrated minerals and anhydrous phases (MgSO4·H2O, Na2SO4, MgCl2·4H2O, MgCl2·2H2O, CaCl2·H2O, CaSO4) become stable at lower latitudes. Therefore, there are thermodynamic potentials for seasonal hydration and dehydration of minerals in the middle (~30o to ~60o) latitudes. The list of potential minerals that are able to perform seasonal dehydration-hydration is limited by their potential presence on the Martian surface, and their ability to hydrate and dehydrate rapidly at temperatures of ~200K to ~300K.  Zeolites. Zeolites are framework silicates that could contain significant amounts of poorly-bonded "zeolite" water in large channels of their crystalline structures [20], and exchange of "zeolite" water with the atmosphere is not kinetically limited even at Martian conditions [21]. Zeolites are usually present in the palagonites that are often adopted as models of the Martian soil, and the presence of zeolites in bright surface regions [22] and atmospheric dust [23] is consistent with IR-spectra obtained by MGS TES instrument. However, zeolites, if present, may not be abundant in the soil. First, the Martian palagonite-like material is likely to be highly amorphous (or nanocrystalline), as suggested from near-IR spectra of bright regions [e.g., 24]. Second, formation of zeolites requires alkaline conditions that are unlikely at near-surface conditions affected by acid volcanic gases, aerosols, and aqueous solutions. Third, zeolites have not been found in the Martian meteorites.  Salts. Viking XRF analyses indicate the presence of  Mg sulfate(s) and chlorides of N account for as much as 15 vol. % Pathfinder APXS data [25] show t be abundant, especially in rock seasonal dehydration of epsom kieserite (MgSO4·H2O) [16] and to lower hydrates is unlikely be energies [27,28,29]. However, dehydration of Na sulfate (N Na2SO4·10H2O) proceeds very fa [30]). Complete dehydration of m under vacuum conditions at 16oC and, therefore could proceed i Martian spring-summer seasons w can easily reach 0oC [14].
