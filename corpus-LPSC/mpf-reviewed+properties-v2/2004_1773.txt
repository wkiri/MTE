Introduction:  Recent observations of the 2001 dust storms encircling Mars confirm predictions of environmental challenges for exploration [1, 2]. Martian dust has been found to completely mantle the Martian surface over thousands of square kilometers [3] and the opacity of airborne dust has been shown to be capable of modifying atmospheric temperature [1], radiative transfer and albedo [4]. Planetary dust cycling dynamics are suggested to be a key factor in the evolution of the Martian surface [5]. Long-term robotic and manned exploration of Mars will be confronted by dust deposition in periods of atmospheric calm and violent wind storms.  Aeolian dust deposition recorded during the Mars  Pathfinder mission was estimated to fall at rates of 2045 µm per Earth year [4]. Although many tools of exploration will be challenged by coating, adhesion, abrasion and possible chemical reaction of deposited, wind blown and actively disturbed Martian dust, solar cells are thought to be of primary concern. Recent modeling work of power output by gallium arsenide/germanium solar cells was validated by the Pathfinder Lander data and showed power output decreases of 0.1 to 0.5% per Martian day [6]. A major determinant for the optimal positioning angle of solar panels employed in future missions is the angle of repose of the settling dust particles that is dependent on a variety of physical and chemical properties of the particles, the panel surface, and the environmental conditions on the Mars surface.  While the effects of many of these factors are well understood qualitatively, quantitative analyses, especially under physical and chemical conditions prevailing on the Mars surface are lacking.         Materials and Methods:  To gain basic understanding of the physical and chemical processes that govern dust deposition we simulate atmospheric conditions expected on the Mars surface in a controlled chamber, and observe the angle of repose of Mars dust surrogate using small spherical or cylindrical instruments. The angle of repose of surrogate Martian dust, θr, has been examined using the relationship sin(θr) = m/d where sphere diameter (d) and dust cone base (m) are ascertained by image analysis following dust deposition in laboratory experiments. [7, 8, 9]. In this work we report progress and preliminary results from our environmental chamber experiments that allow for dynamic dust surrogate deposition in a simulated Mars atmosphere controlled for gas make-up, pressure, temperature and humidity (Fig.1). The active deposition is followed by a static analysis of images of dust cones formed on spheres of various sizes and materials with subsequent calculation of the angle of repose.
