 SULFATES ON MARS: COMPARING TES AND ISM RESULTS.  C. D. Cooper and J. F. Mustard, Department of Geological Sciences, Box 1846, Brown University, Providence RI 02911, Christopher_Cooper@brown.edu. Introduction: Sulfate was observed in the soil on Mars by the Viking and Pathfinder landers in relatively high concentrations (~5-9% SO3) [1,2,3].  Cohesive materials at the Viking sites were found to have elevated sulfur contents compared to fines [2,4,5].  Together with the association of sulfur and magnesium and mixing trends with other elements, this argues for a sulfate salt component in the soils [1,5,6,7].  Remote sensing studies have been attempted in order to identify and map sulfates on the martian surface based on spectral properties of sulfates [8,9,10].  Low spatial resolution telescopic data sets have found hints of sulfate features [8,9]. Our previous work [10] found a number of regions on Mars with TES spectra that were well matched by spectra of laboratory analog materials formed by cementing palagonitic soils with magnesium or calcium sulfate (Figure 1).  The TES spectra have the advantage of much higher spatial resolution (3 km x 6 km) than the telescopic data, allowing smaller spatial exposures of sulfate-bearing soils to be detected.  The sulfatecemented laboratory materials being compared with TES spectra have relatively strong restrahlen bands at ~8.7 µm (1153 cm -1 ) that should be detectable for surfaces where at least 5-10% of the surface is free of obscuring, loose dust [11].  Even though the loose dust contains sulfate, it has extremely weak absorption features due to the very fine particle sizes [11]. The ISM instrument on the Phobos 2 spacecraft gathered moderately high resolution (22 km x 22 km) visible to near-infrared spectra of limited portions of the surface of Mars in 1989.  While sulfates have no strong features in this wavelength region, the hydration state of the soil is expressed in the 3 µm water band. Spatial variations in the water band strength have been documented in the ISM data set [12,13].  If the 8.7 µm spectral feature in the TES data is truly due to sulfatecemented soils, then variations in the water content of the soil should correlate with the sulfate maps. Data Processing: Approximately 8.5 million TES spectra were first selected for quality using factors including emission angle, temperature, spacecraft parameters, etc. [10].  The spectra were then deconvolved into atmospheric and surface components consisting of 2 dust, 2 cloud, hematite, Acidalia, Syrtis, and sulfatecemented soil endmembers following previous works [10,14].  These endmembers along with a blackbody successfully model the low albedo regions on Mars over the 73 bands (excluding the CO2 absorption) from 233 to 1301 cm -1 (7.68 to 33 µm) [14].  Subtraction of the atmospheric components from each of the original TES spectra yielded atmosphere-removed surface spectra.  These spectra were then gridded into 0.5° x 0.5° bins to create a global data set.  A number of regions were matched by sulfate-cemented soil [10]. However, examination of the spectral shapes of these areas showed that some anomalous spectra were being falsely matched.  The selection of a new set of endmembers based on image spectra was able to separate the spectra that do match the laboratory sulfatecemented soil from others that were anomalous [10]. In order to splice the TES data with ISM data, the TES spectra were first converted to reflectance using Kirchhof's Law.  This allows the joined spectra to be displayed on a common axis.  Examples of these joined spectra and their implications for surface composition are presented in two additional abstracts [15,16]. The 64 band ISM spectra (0.77 to 3.14 µm) were matched to the TES half-degree grid via a nearestneighbors approach.  The resultant data cube contains both NIR and MIR spectra of the surface in 137 bands. Because the Phobos 2 mission ended prematurely, only a limited portion of the surface was covered.  The 6 best data cubes of the 9 obtained with 22 km resolution were used here (Figure 2).  These data cubes cover areas of both high and low cemented sulfate abundance as derived from the TES deconvolution. Analysis:  The gridded spectral data were used to calculate a number of spectral parameters.  The strength of the 3 µm water band was calculated from the ISM portion of the gridded data.  The strength of the 1 and 2 µm ferrous iron absorptions were also calculated and compared with mafic endmembers from the TES deconvolution.  These results are reported in a separate abstract [15].

Mustard The fractional abundance of the endmembers chosen from the gridded TES data set form a comparable half-degree grid.  The strength of the water band was compared for each pixel with the fractional abundance of sulfate-cemented soils. Results:  The relationship between the 3 µm water band strength and the cemented sulfate endmember fraction abundance is shown in Figure 3.  There is not a linear correlation between these two parameters.  Instead, regions with low values of cemented sulfate abundance (<0.5) have a wide range of possible 3 µm band strengths (0.5-0.65).  For areas with higher values of cemented sulfate fractional abundances, the 3 µm band strength is roughly constant with a value of 0.6. The large values of cemented sulfate abundance indicate that the image endmember used was probably not the purest spectrum, and likely abundances should be halved. The scatter in the relationship shown in Figure 3 is relatively large due to the low SNR in the 3 µm region for the ISM instrument and the relatively small amplitude of the 8.7 µm absorption in the TES data.  A spatial comparison of the data (Figure 4) shows that areas of high TES cemented-sulfate endmember abundance (white) only exist in wet regions from ISM (yellowred). Conclusions:  The relationship between apparent cemented sulfate abundances and 3 µm water band strength suggests a threshold is present for cemented sulfate soils.  Because sulfate is likely hydrated, a minimum amount of water must be present in any cemented material.  Loose soils, on the other hand, may be much drier.  The amount of water in the cemented material would therefore be represented by the 0.60 value for the 3 µm band strength, as this is the minimum needed before large amounts of the cemented sulfate endmember are seen. The association of high amounts of water with high cemented-sulfate endmember fractions strengthens the previous interpretation that TES is indeed detecting weak, spatially variable, sulfate spectral features on the surface of Mars.  These features are frequently associated with dark red soils [16], which were previously interpreted as cemented soil materials (duricrust) [17,18]. References: [1] Toulmin P. et al.
