Introduction:  Currently Mars missions can collect more data than can be returned.  Future rovers of increased mission lifetime will benefit from onboard autonomous data processing systems to guide the selection, measurement and return of scientifically important data.  One approach is to train a neural net to recognize spectral reflectance characteristics of minerals of interest.  We have developed a carbonate detector using a neural net algorithm trained on 10,000 synthetic Vis/NIR (350-2500 nm) spectra [1]. The detector was able to correctly identify carbonates in the spectra of 30 carbonate and noncarbonate field samples with 100% success [1].  However, Martian dust coatings strongly affect the spectral characteristics of surface rocks potentially masking the underlying substrate rock [e.g., 2].  In this experiment, we measure Vis/NIR spectra of calcite coated with different thicknesses of palagonite dust and evaluate the performance of the carbonate detector. Carbonate Detector:  Our carbonate detector is a three-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN).  The nature of a neural network allows carbonate spectrum to be detected using both the absolute reflectance values and the slope of a spectrum over a wavelength interval.  The network contains 41 inputs, one for each reflectance value in the wavelength range 2.0 - 2.4 µm sampled in 10 nm increments.  Inputs are propagated forward through two hidden layers of 25 and 10 units to a single output.  The output (activation value), in the range 0 to 1, indicates the degree to which the input spectra fits (matches) the prototypical carbonate represented by the network weights. An activation of 0.3 was selected empirically in initial experiments [1] as our positive identification threshold for carbonate minerals. The network was trained on 10,000 samples of synthetic rock spectra appropriate for Mars using the standard Backpropagation algorithm.  In general, real field data cannot be used, as it is cost prohibitive to collect the large number of spectra and corresponding modal mineralogies necessary for an ANN to successfully converge (learn).  Each synthetic rock is a random linear mixture of laboratory spectra of known minerals taken from the ASTER reference library.  To simulate measurement error inherent in collecting field data, Gaussian noise with a 2% standard deviation is added to the training set.  The source code and weight file is <100 KB. Dust Experiment: Martian soil simulant JSC Mars-1 (Ward's) was air fall deposited with a setup similar to those of prior investigators [3, 4].  The bulk material was manually ground in an agate mortar and dry sieved to <45 µm.  A flat 32 cm2 calcite crystal (Chihuahua, Mexico via Ward's) was supported on a raised platform above a dust disseminating device. The device was an open receptacle with an air hose input in one side.  A glass slide positioned against the calcite crystal allowed for repeated thickness measurements to be taken without altering the position of the calcite crystal during the length of the experiment.  Each experiment consisted of 0.1g of palagonite which was evenly dispersed within a bell jar.  After a 15 minute settling period, the bell jar is removed and the dust thickness on the slide is measured with a vertically calibrated petrographic microscope.  Average thickness is determined from 100 grid points in a 1 cm2 region of the slide; thickness measurement error is ≤15µm.  Aerial coverage of dust on the slide was determined by averaging 5 counts of all non-white (non-slide) pixels on digital photomicrographs of different regions of the slide.  Vis/NIR spectra of the coated calcite crystal were obtained with an Analytical Spectral Devices Fieldspec Pro spectrometer operating over a total range of 350-2400nm.  Data were taken using a fiber optic sensor with a 1° field of view foreoptic. After the thickness and spectral data were gathered, the slide and the jar were repositioned, and the next layer was deposited. Results and Discussion: Reflectance spectra for 35 layers of dust deposition (up to 223 µm thick) are provided in Fig. 1.  Dust was deposited until the activation value calculated for the spectrum matched that of pure palagonite.  The reflectance at the blue wavelengths is greatest in the calcite and decreases dramatically with the initial layers of dust deposited. Carbonate vibrational features at 1.7 µm and 2.3 µm and the water absorption bands at 1.4 µm and 1.9 µm are deepest in the calcite and become reduced with successive palagonite layers.  Dust layer thickness (not shown) increases linearly through the first 14 (119 µm, 84% coverage) experiments for which it was measured.  The final thickness underestimates  what is expected for the linear trend and may indicate some settling at thicknesses >119 µm.  Aerial coverage increased exponentially throughout the experiment to a final value of 99.5% coverage. Activation values and continuum depths (D=1Reflectance at trough center/Reflectance of continuum) were calculated for the 2.3 µm feature of each spectrum and are plotted in Fig. 2.  In this experiment, the carbonate detector reached the 0.3 threshold at a dust coating of 102-116 µm (78-85% aerial coverage).  This coincides with a change in the slope of the continuum depth values in Fig. 2 where the depth of the 2.3 µm band changes less with each layer of added dust.  The neural net converges to the 0.3 threshold value due to this change in band depth response.  Importantly, lower threshold values would not improve the detector's ability to resolve carbonate. The nonlinear effect of dust thickness on continuum depth and activation value is evident in this figure.  Activation and continuum depth values drop markedly with the first 3 layers of dust, a rate that decreases with each successive layer.  This logarithmic relationship elucidates the potential signal contamination of thinner dust coatings. That ~100µm of palagonite dust obscures a carbonate signal in this experiment is consistent with studies of dust coatings conducted by several groups, which find that ~40 - 400 µm of dust obscures the Vis/NIR (and TIR) spectral signal of other substrates [e.g., 3-7].  Atmospheric opacity modeling derived from the Pathfinder radiometric calibration target concludes the annual rate of dust deposition on Mars is about 20-45 µm per Earth year [8]; similar results were obtained by the Pathfinder MAE experiment [9].  Dust layers of this magnitude may be expected on rocks within regions of aeolian activity and dust mobilization. Conclusions. These experiments 1) demonstrate the ability of the detector to correctly recognize carbonate under dust layers of up to ~100µm; 2) link the detector performance to specific behavior of the 2.3 µm band; and 3) confirm the significant effects of even thin (~10-20 µm) palagonite dust layers on spectral response of substrate.
