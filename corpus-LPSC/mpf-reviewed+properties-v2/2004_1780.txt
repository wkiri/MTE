Abstract:  Characterizing alteration of the rocks on Mars is difficult, but some guidelines can be made through comparison with terrestrial volcanic alteration. Subaerial volcanic activity on the Hawaiian islands and subglacial volcanic activity on Iceland have led to the formation of a variety of silicate and iron oxide-rich alteration products that may serve as models for chemical alteration on Mars. Multiple samples have been collected from palagonitized tuffs, altered pillow lavas, altered tephra, and S-rich vents for study in the lab.  Variations in the kinds of alteration products have been observed depending on the sample environment. We are defining associations between the alteration products and formation conditions that can be used to provide information about environmental conditions on Mars. In particular, we are providing definitions for palagonitic, pedogenic and solfataric alteration that can be used to characterize these alteration processes. Introduction: Direct evidence of liquid water on Mars has not been found; however, remote detection of alteration minerals may provide evidence of shortor long-term aqueous processes or hydrothermally active sites. The mineralogy of these alteration products holds information about the climatic and geochemical record that can provide clues about the extent and duration of water. The rock compositions on Mars are basaltic to andesitic[1-3], and many of the rocks near the Pathfinder lander contain surface coatings[4]. The soils contain elevated Fe and S levels compared to the rocks[5,6]. Definitive identification of specific minerals has been complicated by the poorly-crystalline nature of phases in the samples, and inconclusive spectroscopic and elemental analyses. The alteration processes that control which silicate, iron oxide/oxyhydroxide (FeOx) and Sbearing minerals form on Mars are directly linked to environmental conditions. Spectroscopic analyses of terrestrial soils and alteration products with known mineralogy, weathering histories, and formation conditions are essential for interpretation of the martian spectra. Geochemical and mineralogical analyses are synthesized here for a combination of new samples as well as samples studied earlier[7-10]. Integrated analyses are underway for the chemical, mineralogical and spectroscopic data from a variety of alteration processes. Reflectance spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), <2 µm sediment fractionation, dithionite iron dissolution, and oxalate treatment have been performed on new samples as in previous studies[9,10]. Detailed high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has enabled characterization of the grain morphology and intimate character of altered volcanic material. Magnetic measurements for a number of these samples have also been performed in order to identify the magnetic minerals present and characterize the magnetic properties of volcanic alteration products from several environments. Preliminary definitions of the solfataric, palagonitic, and pedogenic alteration categories are described in Table 1 based on our results and those of other studies, e.g. [11-13]. Table 1. ALTERATION CATEGORIES Solfataric 1) Pervasive: close to source, may be high-T, high-intensity alteration. .Acid-sulfate at fumaroles or vents. *Opal, kaolinite, sulfates, FeOx. 2) Lower intensity alteration, may be low-T, further from source. .Acid-fog alteration products. * Opal, jarosite/alunite, FeOx. Palagonitic 1) Pervasive: may be hydrothermal, typical geologic definition. .Palagonitic tuff. *Glass, protosmectites, smectites. 2) Lower intensity, low moisture, typical planetary definition. .Palagonitic soil. *Amorphous phases, highly leached in Si and alkali elements. Pedogenic 1) Alkaline environment, low-T, limited leaching. . Weakly leached soil. *Smectite, calcite. 2) Acidic-neutral environment, lowT, extensive leaching. . Highly leached soil. *Kaolinite/halloysite, short-rangeorder Al-silicates, goethite.  Results for Palagonitic Alteration: Palagonitic grains from both type 1 and 2 categories are vitric with alteration rinds.  The classic geologic definition of palagonitic material requires an alteration process that is forming smectites[10]. Type 2 palagonitization occurs under low moisture conditions and includes leaching that enhances Al, Fe, Ti and produces primarily amorphous products. Reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. 1 of palagonitic tuffs from Thórólfsfell, Iceland and Kilauea, Hawaii (type 1) and palagonitic soil from Haleakala (type 2). A microprobe image of an altered grain from the type 2 palagonitic category is shown in Fig. 2. A TEM image of the altered rind material of this sample is shown in Fig. 3A. For comparison a TEM image of smectite in a type 1 palagonite from [10] is shown in Fig. 3B. Fig. 1.  Reflectance spectra of palagonite types 1 and 2 for the VNIR region (A) and the mid-IR region (B). The arrows indicate differences in spectral features that can be used to identify these species. Results for Pedogenic and Solfataric Alteration: Similar microprobe, TEM and spectral data have been analyzed for pedogenic and solfataric alteration.  These results and the literature have been used to develop the trends defined in Table 1. Acknowledgements: MFRP funding for this work is greatly appreciated. Spectra were measured at Brown Univ.
