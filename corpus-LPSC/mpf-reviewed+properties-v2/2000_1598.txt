Introduction: The detailed shape [1,2], density [3], and photometric behavior [4,5] of the martian moon Phobos are well characterized.  As previously summarized the spectral and color properties of Phobos, at various wavelengths, have been observed by numerous spacecraft and earth-based telescopes [6].  Based upon these observations there is an evolving perspective regarding the composition and origin of Phobos. The post-Mariner 9 and Viking view of Phobos included a homogeneous surface composition, whose low albedo and spectral shape implied a similarity to C-type asteroids (and by analogy to carbonaceous chondritic meteorites).  These properties coupled with the relatively low density (≈2.2±0.30 g cm-3 determined from Viking Orbiter), similar to that of carbonaceous chrondrites, led to interpretations of Phobos having formed in the outer part of the main asteroid belt, where it could incorporate lower density material, with subsequent delivery and capture at Mars [7-8].  The alternative formation scenario was based upon dynamical considerations of the orbit and its evolution.  In this scenario, Phobos formed in situ and hence should be composed of similar materials as Mars, having a higher density and more basaltic composition [9-11] in apparent contradiction with the observations.  The soviet mission to Phobos provided a greater constraint on the density with some accompanying color and spectral observations.  The revised density (≈1.9±0.10 g cm-3) is near the lower limit of that associated with carbonaceous chrondrite meteorites requiring either significant porosity [10], or incorporation of lower density materials such as water ice [12].  Color data, broad-band thermal observations, and nearinfrared spectra clearly showed heterogeneity across the surface at the ≈10% levels [see 6].  Murchie and Erard [6] illustrated that the spectral properties of Phobos were inconsistent with C-class asteroids.  Two color units were defined (red and blue) and the spectrum of the red unit more closely resembles the spectra of D- and T-class asteroids with a spectral slope similar to mature lunar mare soils, while the blue unit more closely resembles P-class asteroids [6].  The conclusion regarding the red unit was supported by subsequent observations obtained by Mars Pathfinder [13].  Thus these results still do not unambiguously answer questions concerning the composition of Phobos.   D- and T-class asteroids are interpreted as representing primitive materials [14] that can include a significant carbonaceous component.  In contrast, lunar soils represent highly processed and differentiated materials. The Mars Global Surveyor mission was designed chiefly to investigate the surface and atmosphere of Mars [15].  During the second science phasing orbital period there were several unique opportunities to observe Phobos at relatively close distances during which the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) acquired several spectra of Phobos that provide moderate spatial resolution.  The TES instrument is a Michelson interferometer operating from 1700 to 200 cm-1 (~6 to 50 µm) [16-17].  At these wavelengths the TES can detect a materials fundamental vibrational modes whose number, position, intensity, and shape are dependent upon the atomic masses, inter-atomic force fields, and molecular geometry, providing a sensitive means of determining mineralogy [16].  We are using these data in an attempt to elucidate the composition of Phobos.  In particular we hope to distinguish between the two alternative suggested compositions; primitive carbonaceous material vs. a mafic assemblage.  Spectral contrast at thermal infrared wavelengths is strongly dependent upon particle size.  Coarse particles have high spectral contrast with well-defined spectral features whereas fine particles have low spectral contrast with subtle spectral features [18].  Thermal inertias of Phobos, derived  from Viking Orbiter [19] and Phobos-2 [20-21], were interpreted to indicate that Phobos is chiefly covered by a layer (1-3 cm) of fine materials (50-100 µm particle sizes).  Subsequently, re-evaluation of the Phobos-2 data led to the suggestion that the particle sizes on Phobos were 2-3 times larger than the medium grain diameters of the Moon (~80 µm, or for Phobos 160-240 µm) [22].  The spectral signatures of materials representing primitive carbonaceous materials and mafic assemblages are shown in Figure 1.  The curves shown in Fig. 1 are calculated (except as noted by E), via Kirchoff's law (1 = r + e, r = reflectance, e = emittance) because emissivities for most of these materials are not readily available.  The particle size of most of the materials shown in Fig. 1 is 0-75 µm (except for olivine and pyroxene) and so these curves illustrate a worst case scenario, as larger particle sizes would exhibit stronger contrasts.  Fig. 1a shows the spectra of various carbonaceous chondrites.  The CI meteorites (Alais & Orgeil) are chemically the most primitive, contain the most abundant water, exhibit aqueous alTES OBSERVATIONS OF PHOBOS:  T. L. Roush and R. C. Hogan  teration of silicates, and alteration of organics to more complex forms [23].  The CM2 meteorite (Murchison) has intermediate water content and exhibit aqueous alteration of both silicates and organics [23].  The C3V meteorite (Allende) is the least chemically altered, contains little water, and contains olivine and other refractory minerals [23].  It is readily apparent that one could distinguish between these three classes of materials based upon the spectral properties exhibited in Fig. 1a.  Fig. 1b shows the spectra of a mafic assemblages and minerals.  The mature lunar soil and basalt data only extend to 14 µm, but one would anticipate spectral features near 20 µm due to the silicates that dominate these materials [16-18] and as is seen in olivine and pyroxene spectra.  Fig. 1c shows the spectra of various organic refractory materials.  Comparing Fig. 1a, 1b and 1c it is apparent that the most primitive meteorites and the organic refractory materials spectra differ from the spectra of mafic assemblages and minerals.  Spectra of the more chemically processed meteorites clearly suggest the presence of silicates, especially near 20 µm.  This suggests that, based upon the spectral properties measurable by TES, one can distinguish between the two materials previously suggested as surface components for Phobos and hence provide a mechanism addressing the solar system location associated with Phobos' formation.  We use a linear combination of 2 or 3 black bodies to perform a least squares fit to the extracted TES radiance for each location on Phobos.  Using these results as inputs, an upper hull is fit to the radiance maxima, again using 2 or 3 blackbodies.  Emissivity values are produced by dividing the measured radiance by the hull.  Initial results (e.g. Fig. 1a), using the highest radiances, show broad relatively weak (<5%) emissivity minima located near 10, 12, 21, 28, and 42 µm.  The weak nature of these features is consistent with a fine-grained surface and their positions at 10, 12, and 21 µm are more consistent with silicates than organic refractory materials.  Subtle spatial variability of these spectral features is seen.  This initial evaluation suggests that Phobos is composed of materials consistent with those of Mars (i.e. silicates) and as a result would imply a formation near Mars's orbit.  However, more detailed analyses are underway. References: [1] Duxbury 1989 Icarus, 78, 169 [2] Simonelli et al. 1993 Icarus, 103, 49 [3] Avanesov et al. 1991 Planet.
