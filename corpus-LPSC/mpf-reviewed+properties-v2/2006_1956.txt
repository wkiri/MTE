Introduction:  Since January 2004, the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission have been able to investigate their respective landing sites thanks to the Athena Science Payload [1]. This scientific payload includes the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) instrument [2], whose role is to determine the elemental composition of martian soils and rocks. Due to a largely increased mobility compared to the Mars Pathfinder mission and thanks to their amazing longevity, Spirit and Opportunity have been able to drive several kilometres away from their landing site locations. Given the large number of APXS measurements (Table 1) multidimensional analysis [3] appears to be an adequate and original tool to investigate such a variety of samples. Thus, our Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on rock measurements at Gusev gives pertinent results, in particular concerning the diversity observed among the rocks of the Columbia Hills encountered by Spirit.

Method:  PCA is a mathematical technique that reduces the dimensionality of a complex system of correlations into a smaller number of dimensions still accounting for most of the data variance [3]. It transforms a number of potentially correlated variables (here: the elemental abundances) into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables: the "principal components", whose covariance matrix is diagonal. The first "principal component" accounts for as much of the data variance as possible and each succeeding component accounts for as much of the remaining variance as possible. Then a change of basis (from the initial basis of the chemical abundances to the new basis of the principal components) is performed in order to plot data in the new space. The user defines the number of axes used for the representation, for instance by choosing the level of variance he wants to be represented. This study concerns the rock measurements: natural, brushed and abraded surfaces by the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) and includes the data acquired by Spirit until sol 470. The PCA has been performed on the standardized data (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1) obtained from the chemical abundances measured by the APXS [4]. The most abundant elements detected by this instrument have been included in the analysis: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, T, Cr, Mn, Fe (13 elements). Nevertheless trace elements Ni, Zn and Br were not used in that study.

Results: The variance accounted by all the computed axes is given in Table 2. On Fig. 1, data are plotted in the PC1 vs. PC2 plan. These two main axes are thus accounting for 70.8498 % of the total data variance among the set of samples. The coordinates of the two principal vectors in the initial basis of the standardized chemical abundances are listed in Table 3.

Coordinates of the measurement points in the two principal axes of the new basis computed by the PCA.   One can notice in Fig. 1 that the dust has a homogenizing effect on the compositions: in general the  measurements made on natural surfaces of rocks still covered by dust are less scattered than the ones made on abraded surfaces by the RAT, which removed the dust layer. This observation is in agreement with a globally mixed martian dust.

Plain basaltic rocks form a group (A on Fig. 1) isolated from the rest of the data, which supports their relatively unaltered nature [5] compared to the rocks encountered in the Columbia Hills. The different clusters of rocks show good agreement with the previous studies of the Columbia Hills rocks. Several classes of rocks (Table 4) had been already identified thanks to various observations coming from the whole scientific payload and interpreted to reflect different geological processes [6-8]. The points corresponding the the abraded rocks used for naming these classes are labeled on Fig. 1. Our analysis allows to define several groups of rocks coherent with this classification: group B corresponds to Clovis class, group C to Peace class and group D to Wishstone and Watchtower classes. Although these two last classes both plot inside group D, the measurements performed on the adraded samples of the Wishstone class clearly plot further from Clovis Class than the abraded samples of Watchtower class do, suggesting Watchtower class might be an intermediate between Clovis and Wishstone classes. Conclusion:  This multidimensional analysis of chemical data shows another evidence of the richness of the information yielded by the APXS instrument. Besides being a systematic method, the PCA gives pertinent results. By taking into account most of the chemical information simultaneously without neglecting any of the main elements detected by the APXS, it can be used as a unsupervised tool to identify and characterize the different families of rocks encountered by Spirit at Gusev . The good agreement with previous studies of Columbia Hills supports such a classification into groups of rocks having undergone similar geological processes.
