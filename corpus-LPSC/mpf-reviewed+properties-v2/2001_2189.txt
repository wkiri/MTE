Although commonly called the Ares Vallis site, different workers arrived at different source channels for the flood-plain materials at the landing site using Viking data.  Those who interpreted channel flow from morphology suggested that Tiu Vallis was the source [1-2], whereas others using thermal inertia and albedo variations to infer grainsize changes concluded that Ares Vallis was the source [3].  In Mars Orbiter Camera images, the MPF site shows a dominant pattern of northwest-trending ridges interpreted to be eolian dunes [4].  Very subtle northeast-trending lineations in the same images were interpreted as geomorphic features formed by flooding from Tiu Vallis [4]. MOLA results.  Here we present a digital elevation model (DEM) of the MPF site region constructed from Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data released as of the time of this writing.  We used the data to interpolate an elevation grid having a 500-m cell size, as shown in Fig. 1. The DEM clearly show the sequence of the most recent flooding at MPF site, as follows: (1) Deposition within lower Areas Vallis.  This material may actually result from an early stage of broad Chryse deposition originating from Kasei Valles [5] or other outflow channels.  The uncertainty results from highstanding deposits identified within lower Ares Vallis [5] and the relatively lower elevation of the floor of upper Ares Vallis compared with that of the lower reach (data not shown). (2) Flows from Tiu Vallis and perhaps easternmost Simud Vallis dissected lower Ares Vallis.  The MPF site occurs on the broad southeastern escarpment of this channel system.  (3) The easternmost reach of Simud Valles cuts slightly into the western margin of northern Tiu Vallis.  Either this event postdated Tiu Vallis deposition, or it formed a late-stage diversion of flow as suggested by [2]. Based on this channel sequence demonstrated by the MOLA DEM, we infer that the MPF site likely rests upon rocks transported from Tiu Vallis, which extends several hundred kilometers to the south. However, the site appears to be on the margin of the downcutting caused by Tiu Vallis; thus some of the rocks at MPF could easily be reworked older deposits of lower Ares Vallis.  It appears then that we are hopelessly at a loss in being able to pinpoint the source area for rocks at MPF.  For now, it seems that all the major Chryse channels could have contributed rocks.
