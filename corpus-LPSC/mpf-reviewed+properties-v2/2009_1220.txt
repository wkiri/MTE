Introduction:  Dust  devils  are  an  effective  aeolian erosion  mechanism  of  small-scale,  substantially  particle loaded convective vortices driven by insolation, common on both  Earth  and  Mars.  These  vortices  are  highly  turbulent flows with dust entrainment that is dictated by the surficial material over which they pass, the ambient wind that push them, and the pockets of hot air that power their "engine", thus they fluctuate second-to-second laterally and vertically. On  Mars,  dust  devil  activity  might  support  the  persistent dustiness in the atmosphere [1], although spacecraft observations appear to rule out the possibility that Mars' global dust storms are triggered by dust devil activity [2,3,4].  This report offers field observations critical to such concerns. Understanding  the  climate  influence  of  injecting  fine particles into the upper atmosphere by dust devils requires data  describing  their  size  frequency  distribution,  and  the amount of dust that they lift, yet few studies have attempted direct  measurement  of particle  loading.  Terrestrial  LIDAR observations at ~100m height [5] show an ~103 enhancement compared to ambient dust loading, allowing an estimate of actual dust load of ~0.1gm-3. More attempts have been made to estimate dust load for martian dust devils using estimates of  optical  depth  from orbit  [6]  and  the  surface  [7,8].  [6] measured a dust load of ~0.03 gm-3; [7] found a range from 0.01 to 0.1 gm-3.  [8]  published data only for estimated flux and particle loads cannot be calculated from their data. Over  the  past  decade  we  have  performed  in-situ sampling and analyses of over 100 dust devils [e.g. 9,3,10]. These penetrations produced data such as wind speed, temperature, pressure and dust or total sediment load. Here we summarize field data made between 1995 and 2005; the first in-situ dust  devil  dust  and  particle  loading  measurements presented in the literature. Instrumentation: The in-situ sampling technique used is based on a mobile, instrumented platform, advancing the pioneering work of [11], evolving from a single 2 m height sensor cluster fixed to a 4WD vehicle, through a 5 m vertical meteorology mast profiling array held well in front of the vehicle ("DASHER"). Correct placement of any survivable instrumentation into the path of these dynamic phenomena is a non-trivial challenge and few instruments are available whose  design  can  endure  the  conditions  involved  and provide the response time required.  We have utilized cup, 3-component  propeller,  2D and 3D sonic  anemometers as well as pressure and temperature sensors at various heights. Site characterization, vehicle orientation relative to the dust devil's track, and ambient weather data are also recorded. We have used a variety of commercially produced and custom-built sensors to sample particle loading in dust devils. These include upwards-looking UV sensors [12], Piezoelectric  saltation  impact  detectors  (SensitTM and  PVDF, polyvinyl difluride film, [12]), total suspended particle load (HiVol™) and suspended particle load in the 0.1 to 10 µm diameter range (particulate matter PM10).  PM10 measurements  used  either  active  DustTrakTM or  passive  HAMTM (Handheld Aerosol Monitors) sensors, both of which rely on measuring the angular patterns of light scattered by a cloud of small particles (Mie scattering). Standard deployment for DASHER involves outrunning the dust devil, positioning directly into it's oncoming path, lowering  the  instrument  array  to  ground  level,  and  allowing  the column to cross the array. Post-encounter data logging captures ambient conditions.  The current version of DASHER follows 10 years' refinement  of both  design  and implementation,  including the capability to repeatedly sample the same dust devil. Field  locations: Investigations  were  conducted  in  three field sites in the USA. Beginning in 1995 the prime study area has been Eldorado Valley (EV), a closed playa basin (flat, hard, and dry, with zones of fine and coarse surficial material)  outside Boulder City, in southern Nevada [13,9,14] where climate is  arid,  hot  and  with  frequent,  strong  insolation.  Additional chase campaigns were conducted on the Rosamond Lake Bed (RO) at Edwards Air Force Base, in the Mohave desert, and on agricultural  fields south of Eloy (EL), in the basin and range province of south central Arizona. EV and EL both offer arid surfaces with vegetation roughness elements while EV and RO provide  expanses  of simple  geologic  environments  on  which high  speed  pursuits  can  safely be  run.  Additional  work  was conducted near the Sabancaya volcano in the Peruvian Andes and a new site is being established in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Results Concurrent in-situ measurements of sediment and  wind field,  1996-2005:  Airborne particles  from 33 dust  devil encounters were collected or measured during the 1996, 2000, 2002 and 2005 EV, and 2005 EL field seasons.  Vertical wind speeds were also measured in some of these studies. In addition to aerosol measurements, during 1996 a vacuum collection system acquired  total  suspended  sediment  (TSP)  at  2  m height, capturing dust, silt, sand and mud flakes of all sizes up to 15 mm.  Flow rate and collection duration were used to determine the TSP mass flux [9]. Peak and mean aerosol and W (vertical) measurements  presented  here  are  only  for  within  the  dust column. Flux is calculated simply as vertical wind speed multiplied by particle load. When defining the column in this manner a flux of less than zero is possible given downdrafts within the dust devil core. This may  explain the erosive efficacy of a vortex laden with abrasive particulates capable of wearing away surface crusts and disbursing aggregates into puffs of dust; analogous to the "beater bar" in a vacuum cleaner. Neither peak or  mean PM10 nor  TSP correlate strongly with time of day, peak H, peak W, or dust devil diameter, suggesting that local dust lofting conditions are separate from the larger  scale  turbulence  that  generate  the  dust  devil  columns. Mean and max PM10 correlate well, however, and indicate that maximum dust loading is ~3 times the mean dust loading across the column. Discussion Peak vs. mean flux: A well-documented 2005 EV_16-06-05_15:43 event had a surface footprint of ~176 m2 and lasted over 10 minutes.  Given this dust devil's mean flux of 7.5 mgm-2s-1, such an event would loft 792 g of PM10 material,  but with a maximum flux of 98 mgm-2s-1,  it  may have yielded 10.3 kg of respirable dust - a substantial amount of airborne material. Most previous authors have simply multiplied peak vertical wind speed by peak dust load to obtain flux.  We believe the mean values for PM10 concentration and mean values for W (given a dust column width defined by either UV or PM10 profiles) are more valid data for flux calculations, especially once the complex vertical near-surface wind field and amount of material recycled in the base of the dust devil is understood. The mean 'peak PM10' concentration  for  21  encounters  was  43.8  mgm-3,  the  mean 'mean PM10'  concentration  across the  column for  13  encounters  where  concurrent  3-dimensional  wind  data  was available was 15.1 mgm-3. Flux calculation with this data indicates maximum and mean flux values of 56.6 mgm-2s-1and 7.5  mgm-2s-1 at  4.5  m height.  Thus  the  mean  flux  in  the column can be from ~1/50th to ~1/10th of the peak value, depending on the variability of the vertical wind. PM10 vs. TSP loading in dust devils:  Dust devils entrain particles ranging from fine dust and silt to granule or even pebble-sized clasts. Not all this material is transferred into the atmosphere. For example, the 1996 season  in-situ measurements [9] of TSP and vertical wind speed gave total particle flux of ~600 to 4300 mgm-2s-1. Combined with observations of dust devil diameters of 7-15m and lifetimes of ~5 minutes, this suggests that these dust devils (re)moved up to  >200kg of  material  from the  surface.  Subsequent  field campaigns focusing only on the PM10 dust  component  of the columns show much lower flux values (<150 mgm-2s-1 for peak values and <30 mgm-2s-1 for mean values). From all encounters, the mean values for TSP (296 mgm-3) exceeded maximum PM10  (43.8  mgm-3)  by  about  7  times  and  the mean PM10 (15.1 mgm-3) by about 20 times, suggesting ~85 to 95% of the basal sediment load is coarse grained and unlikely to  be transported  to  significant  heights  or  distances downrange, forming instead the observed sand ejecta aprons. Conversely,  applying  this  result  to  the  five  dust  devils sampled in 1996 suggests the commonplace delivery of ~20 kg of fine particulates per dust devil to at least several hundred meters height. Comparison with other dust events: In our studies, vortices were visible with as little as 4 mgm-3  PM10 load, only 30  times  ambient  levels,  whereas  maximum dust  loading events exceeded 150 mgm-3. Comparatively, several authors have reported ambient levels and dust transport events in terrestrial arid regions that are 2 to 4 orders of magnitude less intense  [9].  Dust  devils  are  clearly  extremely  efficient erosional mechanisms. Comparison with other dust devil studies: Our terrestrial results give the first detailed in-situ measurements of dust devil particle load and include several columns with maximum flux of 100 - 120 mgm-2s-1, with a mean flux across the typical column of  7.5 mgm-2s-1 at 4.5m. [15] estimated that a typical  dust  flux  was  ~28  mgm-2s-1 and  TSP  flux  of  520 mgm-2s-1 (although their method was not described). [5] used LIDAR to remotely estimate a terrestrial dust devil column peak loading of 100 mgm-3 and peak vertical velocity of 10 ms-1 to calculate a dust flux of 1000 mgm-2s-1. Our peak flux results are consistent with the [15]  data and, although our PM10 measurements agree well with [5], we suggest that the vertical wind speeds they use are possibly not typical (usually peak W is ~25% of peak H; [16]) and thus their flux estimate may be too high. For Mars, [7] used column opacity to estimate the particle loading  for  a  dust  devil  observed  by  the  Imager  for  Mars Pathfinder camera, calculating a particle load of 70 mgm-3 and, using an estimate for vertical wind speed of 7 ms-1, a vertical flux of 500 mgm-2s-1. [8] used surface imaging of Martian dust devils in Gusev crater to calculate vertical wind speeds of 0.2 - 8.8 ms-1, a range well matched by our  in-situ terrestrial measurements, giving maximum and mean dust flux estimates of 459 mgm-2s-1 and 21 mgm-2s-1, respectively (similar to our observations although the peak values are higher). The vertical speeds used  for  estimates  of vertical  flux  in  martian  dust  devils  by [17], 15 ms-1, and [18], 20 ms-1, however, were not observed in  situ and are probably a factor of 2-4 too high. Laboratory vortex simulations at Earth and Mars atmospheric conditions [19] yield a dust flux range of 10 mgm-2s-1 to 10,000 mgm-2s-1, with the upper range being greater than the field-based TSP reported here. Conclusions: Using a variety of mobile test bed platforms, we have reliably determined  in-situ sediment  loading of dust devils,  concurrent  with  wind  data.  Of  those  total  suspended particles, however, ~10% consists of PM10 fine aerosols that are carried well  above and beyond the source area.  Our encounter data suggests that mean dust loading and flux is ~ one third  that  of measured peak loading and flux and provides  a field-based conservative measure of atmospheric aerosol contribution.
