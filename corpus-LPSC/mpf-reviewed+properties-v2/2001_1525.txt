Results of  the studies of lunar soil composition by Alpha-Proton Spectrometers on the �Surveyor� spacecrafts [1] and of martian rock and soil composition by an Alpha-Proton-Xray Spectrometer on �Mars Pathfinder� [2] have demonstrated the usefulness of in-situ measuring instruments employing radioactive sources of alpha-particles and modern semiconductor detectors.  Nevertheless, the methods of alpha-particle backscattering and alpha-particle induced Xray emission, used in the above mentioned instruments,  do not allow to determine hydrogen, which may be present in soils as crystal hydrates or in some other form.  One method used in laboratories for the determination of hydrogen in surface layers of samples [3, 4] consist in the measurement of  protons scattered in the forward direction in the process of elastic scattering of alpha-particles from accelerators on hydrogen nuclei. The authors are, however, not aware of an application of this method using alpha-particles from radioactive sources. As shown below, such a method appears feasible for the determination of hydrogen in surface layers of solar system bodies (planets, their satellites, asteroids and comets) by means of in-situ measuring  instruments. For the martian soil about 1% by weight H2O have been estimated [5-7]. The proposed method would allow the measurement of such concentrations by means of a very compact device with tens of times smaller mass than with gas chromatographs and mass spectrometers. The physical process underlying the proposed method is the elastic scattering of alpha particles on hydrogen isotope�s nuclei. The energy of the recoil particle E in the coordinate system, where the energy of the alpha particle is equal to E0 and target nuclei (hydrogen isotopes) are at rest, is described by  the following equation: ( ) )(cos 4 2 20 00 θmm mm EE += where m0 and m are the masses of alpha-particles and hydrogen nuclei correspondingly, and θ is the angle between the velocity vectors of the alpha-particles and the recoil particles. The mass-depending factor in this equation is equal to Kp = 0.64 for protons and Kd=0.88 for deuterons. For alpha-particles with 5.8 MeV energy and a  mean scattering angle θ of 20° the maximum energy is 3.27 MeV for recoiling protons and 4.49 MeV for recoiling deuterons.    Fig.1 Schematic arrangement for the measurement of spectra of protons and deuterons scattered in the forward direction by alpha-particles from 244Cm.  The experimental model of a hydrogen spectrometer used in this work consisted of a block of detectors of an Alpha-Proton-Xray-Spectrometer  designed for �Mars-96� (similar to the instrument used on �MarsPathfinder�), three 244Сm sources with a total activity ca. 12 mCi, and the associated electronics. Sources and detectors were arranged in a geometry as shown in Fig.1. With the help of this experimental setup proton spectra of samples with different hydrogen content were recorded and counting rates of forward scattered protons determined (Tab.1 and Figs. 2 &3). The spectra in Fig.2 show that the maximum energies of recoil protons and deuterons are in the good agreement with theoretical calculations and the separation of the maximum energies of 1.16 МeV (41 channels in a 256 channel spectrum) even permit to measure the ratio of hydrogen to deuterium for a wide range of concentrations. The shapes of proton spectra of some samples, shown on Fig.3, demonstrate the independence of the spectral distribution of  protons from the elemental composition of the sample. Their intensity is deter Fig. 2 Spectra of protons and deuterons scattered in the forward direction for H- and D-polyethylene.   DETERMINATION OF HYDROGEN IN SURFACES: Prilutskyi et al.  mined only by the content of hydrogen (Murchison - 1 wt.%, KHCO3 - 1 wt.%, SiO2 < 0.036 wt.%). As to the contribution of protons from (α, р) - reactions, their intensity does not exceed 0.1% of the total intensity in the energy range of interest. Counting rates of protons, scattered in the forward direction, are showed in Table 1. They indicate the presence of hydrogen on the surface of all measured samples. In part this is due to contamination of the sample surfaces by hydrogen (sorption, hydration etc.) when stored under conditions of the Earth's atmosphere. Also visible in the  spectra are protons of higher energy, produced in (α,p)-reactions. The contamination level of metal foils corresponds to an apparent hydrogen content on the surface of 0.1-0.2 wt.%; for teflon and quartz glass the contamination is lower by one order of magnitude. The fractional mechanical removal of an oxidized layer from a sample of iron (N 10 and 11 of Tab.1) reduced the apparent hydrogen content on the surface by seven times, which supports the conjecture of hydrogen contamination on the surfaces of the samples. According to conventional analysis the hydrogen content of the Аllende meteorite is equal to 0.06 wt.% [8], that of the Murchison meteorite is equal to 1.26 wt. %. However the values vary considerably from sample to sample. Hence, our results agree well with previous data. In the case of the Allende meteorite surface contamination and protons from (α,p)reactions may be responsible for our higher value.  In all calculations of hydrogen concentration, presented in Tab. 1, KHCO3 powder, having 1 wt.% of hydrogen, was used as a standard. Sufficient measurement durations asssured data with good statistical accuracies (~1 % in most cases). p aR 4(   Fig. 3 Spectra of protons scattered in the forward direction from a carbonatious meteorite and two standard samples.
