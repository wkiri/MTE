 THE EFFECT OF "MARTIAN" DUST ON THE REFLECTANCE SPECTRA OF IGNEOUS AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS   Ingrid K. Lindstrom and Marilyn M. Lindstrom1, 1SN2 NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston TX 77058, mlindstr@ems.jsc.nasa.gov. Fine airborne dust covers everything on Mars' surface.  A knowledge of the effect of this dust on the reflectance spectra of rocks is essential to interpreting the data collected by the Pathfinder IMP camera or Earth-based telescopes.  We have conducted a simple experiment to evaluate how much dust it takes to obscure the spectra of a variety of rock types. We have dusted rocks with varying amounts of Mars soil simulant and measured their reflectance spectra with a portable spectrometer. Samples  The rocks used in this experiment were terrestrial igneous and sedimentary rocks.  They were chosen to represent a variety of rock types that may be present on Mars' surface.  These included basalt, andesite, granite, limestone and both red and grey sandstones.  The samples selected were hand specimens from the JSC collection.  They were selected to have relatively uniform textures and flat (but unpolished) surfaces for measurement.  The granite was the coarsest grained and least uniform. The soil simulant used in this experiment was JSC Mars-1 [1], which was made from a Hawaiian palagonite that closely matches the Mars soil in reflectance spectroscopy [2].  A large amount of the palagonite was excavated, sieved to 1 mm, and dried to produce the homogeneous simulant.  To obtain the very fine dust needed for this experiment we sieved the simulant again at 149 µm. Procedures  The instrument used for this experiment was the LPI portable reflectance spectrometer  [3].  It is an inexpensive instrument which uses LED lamps and a photo transistor detector to measure nine bands in visible to near IR wavelengths (430-940 nm).  LCD readouts were handentered into a computer for data reduction. A series of test runs on rocks with the spectrometer allowed us to set conditions for the dusting experiment.  Factors that had to be held constant were location on the rock sample and length of time between measurements.  Duplicate readings were taken for each measurement.  Each set of measurements included standard white paper for normalization, soil simulant, and dust-free rocks. For the dust-covered runs we measured quantities of fine soil from 10 to 250 mg and sequentially distributed it over a 10 cm2 area of each rock using a fine sieve.  The 10-50 mg runs had a barely visible layer of dust while in the 150-250 mg runs the dust coated the rock surface.  The reflectance spectrum was measured for each quantity of dust on each rock. Results  Reflectance spectra for individual rocks and soils are shown in figures 1 and 2.  Data are generally similar to that derived from more complex spectrometers, with the possible exception of a dip in the amber (605 nm) region.  Overall reflectance levels and patterns are similar to those in laboratory and remote sensing equipment. Among rock samples (Fig 1) the two basalts have the lowest reflectance and limestone the highest reflectance.  The basalts and andesite show a decrease in the IR which represents the pyroxene band.

Lindstrom and M.M. Lindstrom However the spectrometer does not measure far enough into IR wavelengths to evaluate this in detail. Analyzed samples of JSC Mars-1 included the bulk simulant, and coarse and fine fractions (Fig 2).  JSC-1 lunar soil simulant was analyzed for comparison.  The lunar simulant (which has a basaltic composition) has the lowest reflectance and a pattern very similar to the basalt patterns.  The fine Mars simulant has the highest reflectance, while the coarse fraction is essentially identical to the bulk Mars simulant. Reflectance spectra for basalt dusted with varying amounts of fine Mars simulant are shown in figure 3.  Basalt dusted with 10 mg soil/10 cm2 area has a spectrum essentially identical with the basalt. When dusted with 50-75 mg soil, the reflectance is slightly higher, but the pattern is still recognizable as basalt.  With 100-250 mg soil the reflectance is still higher and pattern more like the soil than the basalt. All samples dusted with the minimum soil had reflectance spectra nearly identical to that of the rock.  With increasing dust the spectra became more soil-like.  Details of the spectra vary from rock to rock according to how its spectrum differs from that of the Mars soil simulant. The red sandstone is hardest to distinguish from the soil because their reflectance spectra are most similar.  The andesite spectrum is in the same range of reflectance as the soil, but patterns criss-cross with andesite higher in low wavelengths and lower in high wavelengths.  The samples with 75250 mg dust have low reflectance throughout.  The spectra for limestone, the most reflective rock, are all lower than the rock sample, with generally soil-like patterns above 75mg dust-cover.  To generalize, the effect of soil cover is to reduce the overall reflectance (except for the very dark basalt) and to show a range of more soil-like patterns with increasing soil-cover. Discussion  These data may be compared with the data from the Pathfinder IMP camera [4] and remote sensing data for bright and dark regions on Mars [2].  The spectrum of the fine soil simulant is similar to those of bright soils in both studies.  The spectra of the bulk and coarse simulants are closer to those of dark soils.  Details of the patterns are not identical but could be due to incomplete calibration of our spectrometer, especially in the amber region. The reflectance spectra of the basalts in this study are very similar to the Pathfinder dark rocks [4]. The andesite spectrum is generally similar to the Pathfinder bright rocks.  However, it is very difficult to distinguish mineralogical variations from dust contamination in our data.  The quality of our data are not sufficient for making mineralogical conclusions. The most valuable use of our data, and its intended purpose, is to set limits on the amount of dust cover that obscures the reflectance spectrum of the rocks.  Rocks covered with 10-50 mg soil simulant were still easily observable as distinct rock types. Samples with more than 100 mg soil had spectra much more like soils.  These masses of soil were spread over rock areas of about 10 cm2.   Using a soil density of about 1 g/cm3 [1] we can calculate thicknesses of dust cover.  When coated with 10 µm of dust, the rock spectra are not significantly obscured, but when the dust coating is increased to 100 µm the rock spectrum is essentially lost in the dust.  These results should be useful in interpreting the Mars results. References [1] C. Allen et al. (1998) this volume. [2] R. Morris et al. (1993) GCA 57, 4597. [3] A. Treiman et al. (1998) this volume.
