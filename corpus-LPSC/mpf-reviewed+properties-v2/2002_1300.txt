Introduction: We have mapped the thermal inertia and albedo of potential Mars Exploration Rover (MER) landing sites at ~3 km resolution using observations made by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES). Thermal inertia is a relevant property to landing site analysis because it is a direct indicator of physical properties of the surface at the same decimeter-to-meter scale to which a lander or rover is sensitive.  Albedo information complements this data and aids in its interpretation. Data Sets:  Thermal inertia.  Thermal inertia (I) is a derived quantity that requires TES nighttime-bolometricbrightness temperature observations (see [1] for details on the model, methodology, and uncertainties).  Formally, thermal inertia depends on the thermal conductivity, bulk density, and specific heat of the surface.  In particular, the large dependence of conductivity on the nature of the surface materials allows one to use remote determinations of thermal inertia to derive information on the physical nature of the surface. Low-thermal-inertia surfaces can be produced only by a covering of low-thermal-conductivity material such as unconsolidated fines.  On Mars, the lowest thermal inertia values require the surface to be predominantly covered by a layer of dust at least a few centimeters thick with an average particle size less than ~10 µm.  Surfaces with higher thermal inertia values are more complicated. Thermal inertia can be increased by anything that increases the thermal conductivity of a surface, such as increasing the average particle size, increasing the degree of cementation of a crust, or increasing the rock abundance or exposure of bedrock.  Therefore, the interpretation of a high thermal inertia surface is difficult because it can be non-unique. The Viking and Pathfinder landing sites provide ground truth that helps us understand how to interpret thermal inertia.  Clearly, however, these three sites have complex surficial geology.  Each site contains a number of different components, including deposits of fine material, crusts that consist of fines bonded together, and rocks of various sizes, shapes, and textures.  Each site has been acted on by a number of geological processes, possibly including flood, volcanism, impact, and aeolian processes.  Thus, using a single number such as thermal inertia to describe the surface is difficult at best; combined with the inherent ambiguity in the interpretation of high thermal inertias, this will limit the results that can be obtained.  Despite this, however, it is clear that thermal inertia provides important information on the nature of the surface at decimeter scales, especially when combined with other remotesensing observations.  Albedo. Albedo (A) is an observed quantity from TES daytime-bolometric-reflectance measurements. Albedo is controlled predominantly by the composition and particle size of the upper most tens of microns of the surface and therefore offers information on a different scale from thermal inertia. When used in conjunction with thermal inertia, albedo data further enhances our interpretation of the physical structure of the surface. Analysis of specific regions: We have mapped thermal inertia and albedo for a number of regions including past and potential upcoming landing sites. For this discussion, we have directed our focus to the four areas chosen as MER landing site finalists by the landing site selection community. In each case, problematic observations were eliminated and the maps of TES data sets were superimposed on the Viking-based MDIM2 for geological context. In addition to examining the detailed relationship between the geomorphology and the data at each site, we noted for each feature whether there was a correlation between the thermal inertia and the geomorphology, the range of I and A values within the ellipse, and how these values compared to the surrounding terrain as well as to the past landing sites.  We then interpreted the implications of the data on the physical structure of the surface and whether it posed any concern as to landing in the area. Observations:  Most of the Hematite sites have average albedo and thermal inertia values lower than any of the past landing sites (see Table 1).  The albedo values in the ellipses are fairly low suggesting that there is little dust in these ellipses.  The thermal inertia data is uniform within the ellipses suggesting that the decimeter scale surface is fairly consistent across the ellipse.  These areas could be similar to past landing sites, but perhaps with less dust to account for the lower albedo values and less induration of the exposed surfaces and/or fewer rocks to account for the lower thermal inertia. The Melas Chasma site has a low average albedo and a fairly high average thermal inertia (see Table 1).  The majority of the ellipse probably has little or no dust cover.  Thermal inertia values in the ellipse vary quite a bit signifying that the decimeter scale surface varies across the ellipse.  Much of the ellipse has moderate thermal inertia values similar to past landing sites  Physical Properties of MER Landing Sites:  S. M. Pelkey et al.  and could look similar.  However, about ¼ of the central area of the ellipse is covered by values > 1.5 times Pathfinder values and could represents a fundamentally different surface than any we have landed at thus far.  Neither albedo nor thermal inertia are uniform in the Gusev Crater ellipse.  The albedo values are fairly high as well (see Table 1) indicating a nonuniform dust cover that is at least greater than a few microns thick in places.  Thermal inertia values within the ellipse are intermediate (see Table 1) and could be due to either a partly indurated or rocky surface or a thermally intermediate (> 1-3 mm, < few cm) layer of dust atop a high-thermal-inertia surface.  The latter hypothesis is supported by fact that slightly darker areas have slightly higher thermal inertia values as well as by the general lack of correlation between thermal inertia and any crater geology. The Athabasca site is uniform in albedo, but nonuniform in thermal inertia.  The albedo values are fairly high (see Table 1) indicating dust cover that is at least greater than a few microns thick in places.  The thermal inertia values vary from values lower than any of the past landing sites to values greater than Pathfinder (see Table 1).  Again this could be a surface with varying degrees of induration and/or rock abundance or it could be a layer of dust on top of a high thermal inertia surface varying in thickness from thermally thin (< 1-3 mm) in places to thermally intermediate (> 1-3 mm, < few cm) in others.  Nearby low-thermal-inertia regions covered by a thermally thick (> few cm) dust layer suggest that the dust cover in the surrounding area is extensive and that it is most likely thinning out across the Athabasca site, but is still significant.  The areas with the highest thermal inertia values most likely have less dust cover than the areas surrounding them and could be extensively indurated material relating to the outflow history of this site. Conclusions: Thermal inertia values for these sites cover a wide range from values lower than any of the past three landing sites, to values up to almost 2 times the highest of the past three landing sites.  Incorporating the albedo data as well, each of these sites allows some detailed interpretation of the thermal inertia data in terms of the area geology.  There is a possibility of landing at a site similar to the past landing sites, but there is also the possibly of encountering fundamentally different surfaces in the high thermal inertia areas of Melas Chasma and Athabasca.  Additionally, the possibility of a layer of dust a few mm in thickness at the Gusev and Athabasca sites could pose some concern to the science that could be done in those areas.
