The alpha proton x-ray spectrometer (APXS) mounted on a deployment mechanism on the back side of the Mars Pathfinder rover Sojourner delivered the first in-situ measurements of the chemical composition of rocks on the Martian surface. Rocks at the Mars Pathfinder landing site are thought to be deposited by catastrophic floods, originating in the ancient heavily cratered southern highlands. The APXS analyses of the rocks yielded unexpectedly high Si and K concentrations pointing to a highly differentiated crustal material in this region of Mars, similar to what is found on Earth. These results contradict the concept of a rather mafic Martian surface as it was generally derived from the Viking soil data and the composition of Martian meteorites. The soils at the Pathfinder landing site have similar compositions to those measured at the Viking sites. This is interpreted as being due to a global dust distribution at least at mean latitudes. The most plausible interpretation for the high concentrations of S and Cl in the Martian soil is the formation of  sulfates and chlorides by the interaction of volcanic gases with the surface material. In general, the Viking soils were interpreted as weathering products of a mafic crustal material. We believe that this interpretation is still mostly correct except that the crustal material consists of both mafic and felsic components. The sulfur contents of the 5 rocks analyzed at the Pathfinder site range from 0.3 % up to 1.6 % [1]. This is more than normally accommodated in magmas or igneous rocks and reflects the fact that all rock surfaces are partly covered with dust, which is known to be rich in sulfur. Applying linear regression to the concentration of each element versus S, the composition of a "soil-free rock" was calculated. Compared to the soils the rocks contain less Mg, Ti, Cr, and Fe but more Si and K. Consequently, the soil cannot have formed directly from the nearby rocks through weathering processes even if an addition of SO2 and HCl from volcanic gases is taken into account. Components much richer in Mg, richer in Fe and Ti but lower in Si and K have to be added. The composition of soils could be explained as a mixture of weathered local rocks and a more mafic component compositionally similar to that observed in Martian meteorites. We believe that the soil composition reflects the mean composition of the Martian surface. Fig. 1 shows a mixing diagram constructed from the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) mean soil composition from which SO3 and Cl was subtracted (middle of diagram) and the felsic component as represented by the MPF soil-free rock (left side of diagram). The data points for potassium of the Pathfinder rock and MPF soil define the element line for K in the diagram. The resulting steep potassium line is used to find the position of the mafic component on the right hand side of the diagram for which the mean composition of all Martian meteorites is used. The element lines (except the one for K) in the diagram are obtained by least square fit of the element concentrations of the soil-free Pathfinder rock, the mean composition of the Pathfinder soils and the mean composition of all SNC-meteorites. We observe surprisingly good fits for all elements, considering this rather crude approach,  which neglects other possible components, as well as all possible sample alterations. The mixing diagram (Fig. 1) obviously indicates that the felsic component and the mafic component contribute about equally to the Martian soil;  this may well also reflect the abundance ratio of the two major components on the Martian surface. Recently we recalibrated the x-ray detector of the APXS to evaluate spectral interferences of low-energy Fig. 1  Mixing diagram of Mars samples. ����'DWD�DUH�QRW�XVHG�IRU�ILWWLQJ�H[FHSW�IRU�.� �� �� �� �� �� �� &R QF HQ WU DWL RQ �> ZW� �@ .∗�� 6L $O∗� )H 0J 03 )�6 RLO �IU HH �5 RF N6 KH UJ RWW \�� �0 HD Q�6 1& V0 3) �6 RLO �Z �R �6 �� &O� (( 7$ �� �� �� $�� �CHEMICAL COMPOSITION MARTIAN SURFACE:  J. Brückner et al. shoulders of Fe and Ca peaks to the main peaks of Mn and K. In this manner we derived data on Mn and K in Pathfinder rocks and soil samples. Their mean Fe/Mn ratio of 39 ± 11 agrees very well with the Fe/Mn ratio of the shergottites of 39 ± 2. The recalculated K data yield about 1 % K2O for the rocks and 0.6 % K2O for the soils. From the measurements of the XRF-spectrometers on board of Viking 1 and 2 only upper limits of 0.15 % K2O have been reported [2]. If the experimenters have not overestimated their sensitivity considerably the difference can only be explained by assuming that the much higher K concentrations (0.6 ± 0.1 % K2O) in the Pathfinder soil are derived from local K-rich rocks at the Pathfinder landing site. Notably, it should be emphasized that the Pathfinder soils and rocks exhibit element-ratio systematics as known from SNC meteorites (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). If  these Pathfinder rocks were derived from the ancient southern highlands then Mars must have formed a highly fractionated crust very early in its history. The Mars Surveyor 2001 mission with a gamma-ray spectrometer on board of the orbiter will map K and Th concentrations on large scale and may confirm the existence of large magmatic highly differentiated and large mafic areas on Mars as suggested by our mixing diagram. Special emphasis was given to obtain information on the carbon content at Ares Vallis from the α-mode. The detection sensitivity for carbon on Mars is drastically reduced by the background introduced by the CO2 of the thin Martian atmosphere of about 6.5 mbar. For the time being we find an upper limit of carbon in the Mars  Pathfinder soils of 0.8 weight%. Whereas sulfur with about 2-3 % and chlorine with ~ 0.6 % are highly concentrated in the soil samples, carbon appears to be low. 5HIHUHQFHV� [1] Rieder, R. et al. (1997) 6FLHQFH 278,�1771.
