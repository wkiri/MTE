IMPLICATIONS OF PATHFINDER DATA FOR THE BULK IRON CONTENT OF MARS. C.M. Bertka and Y. Fei, Geophysical Laboratory and Center for High-Pressure Research, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 5251 Broad Branch Rd., N.W., Washington DC 20015; bertka@gl.ciw.edu Introduction: Folkner et al. (1) recently reported a new value for the moment of inertia factor of Mars based on an improved estimate of the Martian spin pole precession rate determined from Doppler and range measurements to the Mars Pathfinder lander. The value they report, 0.3662 ±0.0017,  and the value of the mean density of Mars, are important geophysical constraints on the composition and structure of the Martian interior.  Dreibus and Wänke (2) derived a model of Martian mantle and core composition independent of the moment of inertia factor of Mars. They used element correlations between measured ratios in the SNC meteorites and chondritic abundances to derive a mantle composition with all oxyphile refractory elements present in C1 chondrite abundance ratios, and a bulk planet composition with a C1 chondrite Fe/Si ratio. Bertka and Fei (3) performed high-pressure multi-anvil experiments with an analog of the Dreibus and Wänke (2) mantle composition (DW) to determine its modal mineralogy up to core-mantle boundary pressures along a model PT profile of the Martian interior. Using the results of these high-pressure experiments, they calculated a mantle density profile for the DW model, and then calculated the moment of inertia factor as a function core composition and crustal thickness (4). The moment of inertia factor calculated for the DW mantle and core composition model, constrained to maintain a bulk C1 Fe/Si ratio, is 0.354 (4). To maintain a C1  Fe/Si ratio requires that the DW model include a 180 to 320 km thick crust, assuming a crust density of 2.7 to 3.0 g/cc. Previously, Sohl and Spohn (5) reached a similar result. They calculated a moment of inertia factor of 0.357 with a 250 km thick crust. Without the addition of a thick crust, the DW model mantle and core composition yields a much higher moment of inertia factor, 0.368, and a bulk planet composition that is deficient in iron compared to a C1 chondrite iron abundance (4,5). Although they did not introduce a crust into their calculations, Ohtani and Kamaya (6) also recognized that the DW model is not consistent with a C1 iron abundance. For the DW mantle composition to be consistent with a moment of inertia factor of 0.3662, and a bulk C1 chondrite Fe/Si ratio, requires that the mass fraction of iron in the core is increased while the density of the core is decreased, compared to core characteristics previously calculated for compositions in the system Fe-S-Ni. Carbon and hydrogen are possible core components that may produce these results. That C and H, in addition to S, may also have been incorporated into an Fe-rich Martian core has been proposed on the basis of cosmochemical arguments and solubility data for C, H and S in silicate melts and molten metallic iron (eg. 7,8). When evaluating the DW model, however, previous core density calculations (i.e. 4,5,6) were based on a core composition  of Fe 14 wt% S ± 7.6 % Ni and did not consider the addition of C and H. In this paper we report the results of core density profile calculations for  model core compositions which include C and H. We determine the effect of including C and H in the core on the bulk planet Fe/Si ratio, and we also calculate the effect of increased mantle density, that is mantle iron content, on this ratio. Based on the results of these calculations, we reevaluate the assumption of a C1 chondrite Fe/Si ratio for Mars and comment on the bulk iron content of Mars. Calculations: Estimates of the amount of H and C that may have been incorporated into the Martian interior are model dependent (eg. 7,8). Dreibus and Wänkes' (2) two component model calls for a bulk planet consisting of a mixture of a highly reduced component and a highly oxidized component in the ratio 60:40. The highly oxidized component contains all elements, including volatiles, in C1 abundances. Assuming that a reasonable estimate for H2O in C1 chondrites is 7.3 wt%, that all of this H2O reacts with metallic Fe to produce FeO and H2,  and that all of this H2 is retained in the interior, Zharkov (7) calculates a maximum H abundance in the Martian interior of 0.16% of the planet's mass. Likewise, assuming that all of the C in the highly oxidized component is incorporated in the Martian interior yields a maximum C content of 1.4% of the planet's mass. Further assuming that all of this C and H enters the core, and from the results of previous calculations in the Fe-S system that the mass fraction of the Martian core is on the order of ~15%, gives an initial estimate of the maximum wt% of C and H in the Martian core. These maximum percentages of H and C in the core, 1.1 wt% and 9.3 wt% respectively, are most closely accommodated by the endmember phases FeH and Fe7C3. The density of model core compositions are calculated as a function of pressure and temperature with a Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. Density profiles are calculated for the endmember core compositions, Fe, FeS, FeH, Fe3C and Fe7C3 (all of which also included 7.6 wt% Ni) . The database for the endmember phases used for model core compositions in the Fe-S system are given in (4). Data for FeH, Fe3C and Fe7C3 are from (9,10).  For each model core composition considered, we calculated the bulk planet Fe wt%, the bulk planet Fe/Si ratio, the mass fraction of the core, the radius of the core, and the thickness of a 3.0g/cc crust by satisfying the geophysical constraints (moment of inertia factor = 0.3662, and mean density) BULK IRON CONTENT OF MARS:  C.M. Bertka and Y. Fei assuming a DW mantle density profile (mantle Mg#=75) (4). Results are reported in Table 1.  In Table 2 these same values are reported as a function of mantle Mg# (Mg#= atomic Mg/(Mg+Fe)) assuming a core composition Fe 14wt% S, 7.6 wt% Ni. Results: The bulk iron content of a C1 chondrite is 27.8 wt%, the C1 Fe/Si ratio is 1.71.  The results presented in Table 1 indicate that the addition of C and H to a S-rich Fe core can not increase the bulk Fe wt% or Fe/Si ratio to C1 values, while maintaining the constraint of a DW model mantle and a moment of inertia factor of 0.3662. Furthermore, the results presented in Table 2 indicate that increasing the iron content of the mantle can not allow for a bulk Fe wt% or Fe/Si ratio comparable to C1 values either. The geophysical constraints argue against the two component accretion model for the inner planets proposed by Dreibus and Wänke (2). The Fe/Si ratio and bulk  iron content of Mars are not equivalent to those of a C1 chondrite. Discussion: Ohtani and Kamaya (6), without considering the effect of a crust or a C and H bearing core, previously suggested that the bulk iron content that could satisfy the mean density and moment of inertia factor of Mars, then estimated at 0.365 (11), was 22.5 to 25 wt%.  Our results, which allow for a crust, consider the addition of C and H to the core, and are constrained by the moment of inertia factor calculated from the Pathfinder data, 0.3662 (1), are similar. The range in bulk  iron content that we calculate for Mars is 22.8 to 25.2 wt%.  To account for the discrepancy between the calculated Martian bulk iron content and a C1 iron content, Ohtani and Kamaya (6) proposed a three component accretion model. A three component model, with one of the components designated as metal, allows for a process of Fe/Si fractionation in the formation of terrestrial planets.  Likewise, future planetary accretion models will have to account for nonchondritic bulk iron abundances and for variations in bulk Fe/Si ratios between the terrestrial planets.
