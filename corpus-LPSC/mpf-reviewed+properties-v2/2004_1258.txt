Introduction:  The Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft has been mapping the elemental composition of the surface materials since June 2002. To study elemental composition variations on the martian surface, seven large regions of Mars were selected: 3 very dusty ones and 4 mainly rocky ones.  Large regions were used to get good counting statistics on as many gamma-ray peaks as possible from spectrum accumulated by the GRS experiment on Mars Odyssey, including elements with poor counting statistics.  Data from TES were used to help select these regions.  Gamma-ray peaks for several elements were analyzed.  Some results and trends are reported.   Regions on Mars:  A global map of thermal inertia [1] was used to select three regions with thick dust covers (low thermal inertia).  According to many MOC and THEMIS visible images, there is a thick dust covering in these regions [H. Newsom, priv. comm.].  Four regions were selected with high values of thermal inertia [1] and high concentrations of TES surface types 1 or 2 [2], (two for each type).  The regions used are summarized in Table 1.  The area of the regions was selected as large as possible to maximize the gamma ray signal (which minimized statistical uncertainties) while keeping the distinct geochemical nature of the region relatively intact.  A large region of the planet consisting of the mid-latitude region plus the polar regions free of any seasonal CO2 frost was also analyzed to compare with the dusty-rocky regions.   Spectral Analysis:  Gamma ray spectra summed for these regions using spectra from June 2002 to October 2003 were analyzed with standard peak fitting methods.  Concentrations of major, minor, and trace elements were determined using the conversions calculated by MCNPX code at the University of Arizona.  Results were obtained for H, Si, Fe, Cl, S, Al, K, Th, and U.  The Si and Al values were determined using the strongest neutron inelastic gamma ray lines.  Fe, Cl, H and S were determined from the stronger neutron capture gamma ray lines.  K, Th, and U were determined from the strongest natural radioactive gamma rays.  Calculated uncertainties are based on the statistics of the spectral fitting, including the background continuum and any spacecraft signal inferred above the thick winter southern seasonal CO2 polar cap.

Preliminary results for U show much scatter and a poor correlation with Th.  Preliminary Al abundances roughly correlate with Si abundances.  Elements that do not show much variation in composition (within the uncertainties) that were analyzed with the gamma-ray data are Fe and S.   0.28 0.26 0.24 0.22 0.20 0.18 0.16 0.14 Cl (% )15.515.014.514.013.513.012.512.0 Si (%) Dusty Rocky1 Rocky2 Frost Free Fig. 3.

However, Pathfinder results represent only a very small spatial region compared to the size of the regions analyzed by the gamma ray measurements.   Table 2.

However, the use of several large regions of a similar type allows us to study variations for several elements, including some, like U, AL, and S, with poor counting statistics.
