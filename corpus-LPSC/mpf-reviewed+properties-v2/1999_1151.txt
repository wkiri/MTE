 ELEMENTAL COMPOSITIONS OF LOCAL ROCKS AND GLOBAL SOIL AT PATHFINDER AND VIKING LANDING SITES:  EVIDENCE FOR ONGOING COMMINUTION OF MARTIAN ROCKS.  Richard V. Morris, Code SN3, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX 77058  richard.v.morris1@jsc.nasa.gov. Introduction:  [1] calculated the elemental composition of local rocks at the Pathfinder landing site under assumptions that APXS analyses on rock surfaces contained contributions from adhering dust, that all the analyzed rocks had comparable elemental compositions, and that SO3 is associated exclusively with adhering soil.  Extrapolation of element versus SO3 plots for rock analyses to zero SO3 concentration gave the concentration of the "soil-free" rock (sf-rock).  Low sulfur abundances for igneous rocks are expected from the limited solubility of SO3 in silicate liquids (0.5-1.0%) and low SO3 concentrations in Archean basalts (~0.2-0.5%) and Martian meteorites (0.03 to 0.48%) [2-4]. Element-SO3 correlations are used here for Pathfinder rock and soil APXS analyses [1] and Viking XRF analyses [5] to calculate major-element concentrations for Pathfinder and Viking local rocks and global Martian soil. Soil-Free Rocks and Rock-Free Soils:  Figure 1 is a plot of major element concentrations versus SO3 for Pathfinder rocks and soils and Viking (Chryse) soil and duricrust samples.  The data are from [1, 5] recalculated to all Fe as Fe2O3T and a volatile-free basis (i.e., H2O = SO3 = 0.0%).  Volatile-free compositions are used to facilitate comparison to rock compositions.  The solid (Pathfinder) and dashed lines (Viking) are regression fits using the method of [6] with uncorrelated errors.  The correlations in Figure 1 (error bars not included for clarity) imply two-component mixtures; one is sf-rock (SO3 = 0.0%) and the other is SO3-rich material (soil at Pathfinder and duricrust at Viking). Concentrations of major elements at SO3 = 0.0, 7.0, and 10.0% are compiled in Table 1. Concentrations at SO3 = 0.0% are sf-rock compositions. As expected, because the rock and soil trends are nearly colinear at Pathfinder (cf., Figure 1), the composition of the Pathfinder sf-rock obtained here and that obtained by [1] are equivalent within error.  The Viking sf-rock has a distinctly different composition which is higher in TiO2 and Fe2O3 and lower in SiO2 (basaltic versus andesitic at Pathfinder).  The composition of the Viking sf-rock is essentially equivalent to the silicate component (Component A) of [7] as calculated from his element correlations and preferred model where all elements except MgO, Cl, and SO3 are associated with the silicate (cf., Table 1).  Both Pathfinder and Viking sf-rock compositions have low MgO concentrations (<3%). The composition of "rock-free" soils (rf-soil) can be calculated if their SO3 concentrations can be inferred.  The rf-soil compositions compiled in Table 1 were obtained assuming average local soils have SO3 = 7.0%.  This value is approximately the upper limit of observed SO3 concentrations at Pathfinder (taking analytical uncertainty into account), corresponds to soil SO3 concentrations at Viking, and does not give unrealistically low SiO2 or high Fe2O3T concentrations at Pathfinder.  Except for TiO2 and MgO, major-element compositions of Pathfinder and Viking rf-soils are the same within error, implying that the concept of a global, homogenous soil is valid.  Because its composition is better determined for more elements, Pathfinder rf-soil is taken as the current best estimate for the elemental composition of average global Martian soil.

The first requirement is analogous to placing an assemblage of igneous rocks in a box and oxidatively altering them by adding H2O and H2SO4 (i.e., volatiles).  Because no elements can leave the box (except volatiles), the alteration is isochemical (but not COMPOSITIONS OF LOCAL ROCKS AND GLOBAL SOIL:  Morris R. V. Table 1.

That is, the chemical signature of the igneous assemblage was not lost.  This situation is implied by the chemically homogenous nature of global Martian soil, as discussed in the last section. The second requirement is not met because there are seven elements (volatile-free basis) and at least 10 possible components (eight SNC meteorites, Pathfinder sf-rock, and Type-1 carbonaceous chondrites).  The number of components can be reduced to six by combining SNC meteorites into four groups:  high-Ca (Nakhlites), high-Mg (ALH77005, LEW88516, Y93605, ALH84001 and Chassigny), high-Al basalt (QUE94201 and EET79001-B), and low-Al basalt (Shergotty, Zagami, and EET79001-A). Mixing calculations were done using the procedure described by [8] with three or less components (compositions from [4, 9] and recalculated to all Fe as Fe2O3T and a volatile-free basis) and no more than one component from each SNC group.  QUE94201 is required because it is the only component with more TiO2 than the Pathfinder rf-soil. Several observations can be made from the results shown in Table 2:  (1) The proportion of QUE94201 is high (40-72%). (2) A component high in MgO is required.  All mixes, except #5 and #7 which use the most Mg-rich member of the high-Al basalt group, use a member of the high-Mg group.  (3) The Pathfinder sf-rock is a viable mixing component (Mixes #1#5).  Mixtures without it (#6 and #7) tend to be depleted in SiO2.  (4) Mixtures using members of the high-Ca group Table 2.  Seven-element mixing-model  for Pathfinder rock-free soil.

(Nakhlites) are not listed because calculations using them as components yielded physically-unreasonable solutions (i.e., negative concentrations and/or totals >>100%).  (5) Volatilefree carbonaceous chondrites, which have high MgO concentrations, are nearly equivalent in mixing-model calculations to the high-Mg SNC group.  Thus, major element chemistry of Martian soil does not require a significant meteoritic component as indicated previously by [10]. Evidence for Ongoing Comminution of Rocks:  It was shown above that the chemical composition of Pathfinder rf-soil can reasonably be regarded as the volatile-free composition of global Martian soil.  The observation that this global soil can be chemically related to a mixture of Martian rocks suggests a closed system, with the consequence that signatures of weathering may not be obtainable from chemical analysis of soils.  Major element variations that are present at both Pathfinder and Viking landing sites (e.g., the strong positive correlation of MgO and SO3) are consistent with mixing of this global soil and degradation products of local rocks.  Rock particles in the soil must be large enough (>10 µm) to prevent immediate distribution by the wind and incorporation into global soil. The presence of ferrous silicates in local Pathfinder soil, as indicated by IMP multispectral data [11], suggests that the local rock particles in Pathfinder soils are fragments of local rock that have not undergone appreciable oxidative alteration to ferric-bering materials since incorporation into the soil. This situation is readily accomplished if comminution of rocks on Mars (e.g., by sand blasting during violent dust storms and/or by impact comminution) is an ongoing process. [12] provide morphological evidence (e.g., spall zones) for ongoing impact comminution of rocks at the Pathfinder landing site. References.
