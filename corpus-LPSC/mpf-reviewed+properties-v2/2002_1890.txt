Satellite mounted instruments are becoming more common, recent examples being Aster for terrestrial remote sensing and TES and THEMIS for TIR imaging the atmosphere and surface of Mars.   Spectra of discrete compositional units have been derived from the low spatial resolution spectra of the satellite mounted TIR spectrometers by linear deconvolution [e.g. 1,2,3].  The effects of coatings on rocks (either particulate dust or 'varnish' layers) will also affect the spectra of the rock surface.   Discussion:   Varnishing of rocks is common in desert environments [4,5], and the spectral effect of varnish layers has been modeled as a checkerboard (linear) mixture of varnish and rock [1].  The assumption of linear mixing is justified with empirical evidence that spectral features related to the varnish vary linearly with coating thickness.  The study was necessarily constrained by the thickness of varnish of the rock samples available, the mean of which did not exceed 27.5 microns.  Thicker coatings, of many multiples of the wavelength of light (~ 60 microns) will have a nonlinear effect on the spectra that will vary with e-kx, where 'k' is the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient and 'x' is the thickness of the varnish [1].  Thicker coatings may be commonplace on terrestrial rocks from other desert locations.  A small fraction of the varnish thickness of terrestrial rocks exceeds 100 µm and can be as great as 200 µm [1,4,5].  Dust coatings have been observed in Pathfinder images of rocks on the surface of Mars.  Thick deposits of varnish may exist as well.  If compositionally similar to terrestrial varnishes, the spectral effect in the TIR will be to act as a grey body at some wavelengths, and at others to contain absorption features [1] and Figure 1.  We will attempt to quantify the effect that a multiply scattering optically thick layer of varnish has on the spectra of common rock types.  The transmission spectrum of a MgO varnish (Figure 1) and other plausible varnish materials will be used to help derive an estimate of the absorption coefficient of varnishes.    The end goals is to better interpret the non-linear effects of optically thick coatings to aid in the interpretation of TIR spectra of rocks on Mars and the Earth that are significantly covered with varnished rocks.
