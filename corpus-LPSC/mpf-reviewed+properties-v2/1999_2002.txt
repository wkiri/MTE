Plains interpreted to be basaltic or fundamentally basalt-like lava flows, comprise a significant fraction of the surface of Mars (1 ,2) and most terrestrial planets. Vesicles are the most abundant single characteristic of basaltic lava flows, and will therefore be one of the most common characteristics of rocks encountered in lander and rover missions and returned samples. Vesicles are records of the initial volatile content and the dynamic and static (pressure) conditions of emplacement of lava flows and records of ambient conditions. Therefore identification of vesicles, and an understanding of their significance, will be important in understanding planetary surfaces in general and significant as clues about early conditions on Mars in particular. Identifying true vesicles from various types of erosional pits, and extracting measurements of number density, size, shape, and overall distribution of vesicles from surface rocks of miscellaneous shape, exposure, distance, and illumination with respect to cameras, will require some detailed and carefully designed experiments in order to define identification discriminants. In order to establish the importance of conducting such measurements, in the following we (1)  outline what is known about vesicle formation in lava flows and (2) touch on their potential utility as records of conditions at the time of emplacement. over the past decade (e.g., 15; 16; 17; 18;19). Currently there are at least four models for the mechanism of vesicle distribution and growth in lava flows (20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26): (1) static (2) inherited, (3) dynamic, and (4) inflated. The success of these disparate models in explaining the observed behavior of vesicles in lava flows illustrates that our understanding of the significance of vesicles is growing but incomplete. These models derive from initial studies of the variations in the vertical structure and vesicle distribution in lava sections that identified three distinct "units" or zones (20; 23): An upper vesicular zone with downwardly-increasing vesicle average diameters and downwardly-decreasing numbers per unit volume (Figure 1), often accounts for the upper one-half of a flow. A middle vesicle-free zone occurs below this, and a thin lower vesicle zone occurs near the base of each flow unit, even in compound sections. The downward size and density distribution in the upper half of most vertical sections defines a characteristic vesicularity profile. Vesicularity is defined as the total vesicle volume per unit volume of dense matrix and agrees well with vesicularity estimates based on the ideal gas law, PV=nRT. Because the volume of gas at a given depth is conservd during coalescence, vesicularity is not a function of vesicle coalescence. Although numerical Pits and Vesicles in Surface Rocks .  Rocks bearing pits occur at all three previous lander sites and are particularly common at the Viking 2 and Pathfinder sites. The pits in martian rocks include likely primary (vesicles) and secondary (weathering) origins (3; 4; 5; 6; 7). Fluting and modification of original pits by wind has clearly occurred in rocks at the Pathfinder site (8, 9 ) as well as possible "sockets" where rounded pebbles have been removed from a sedimentary conglomerate (10). Mars Pathfinder data also show that a high proportion of rocks have basaltic chemical affinities strengthening the arguments for vesicular lavas in the near field. Vesicle Formation . Vesicles are gas bubbles trapped in lava flows and pyroclasts after the enclosing silicate liquid cools and solidifies. Bubbles form in a silicate melt when it is supersaturated with respect to the principal magmatic volatiles (largely H2O, CO2, CO) (11; 12; 13) on ascent and decompression from the source, and, isobarically, by crystallization of anhydrous minerals during initial solidification and crystal growth (14). Once initiated, vesicles in lava flows appear to grow through a combination of gas diffusion from the liquid to bubble nuclei and by physical coalescence of two or more bubbles, a process that continues until solidification occurs. Figure 1.  Representative vesiculation of an upper lava flow section showing downward decrease in vesicularity (vesicle/dense rock volume percent). The significance of vesicles for understanding lava flow emplacement has become increasingly recognized VESICLES: Crumpler et al. models of bubble diffusive growth and buoyant ascent (20; 21; 22; 23) are consistent with the formation of distinct vesicular zones, the decrease in number density is not accounted for by this model. that are pronounced in the upper meter of the lava flows. Although absolute vesicularity is a function of volatile contents of a given magma, catastrophic vesiculation is predicted for lava flows emplaced at less than 100 mb pressure (Figure 2). The differences in vesicularity in response to different environments is recorded as differences in gradient. Measurements of the vertical Studies of thin flow units suggest that bubbles within silicate lava flows may ascend only short distances before solidification occurs (24). Walker (24) and Sahagian et al.(29) argue that in lavas, most of the bubbles are present at eruption (inherited) and that, while the overall vesicularity remains largely unchanged, significant growth of vesicles takes place by coalescence of bubbles rather than diffusive growth from gases within the melts. Coalescence occurs during residence of bubbles at depths where solidification is delayed longest and vesicularity profiles are accordingly locked in during solidification. This highlights the importance of vesicularity as an index of gas volume within lava sections. gradient in vesicularity are therefore desirable rather than measurements at any particular depth or interface. Actual measurements will depend on the ability to identify a variety of other factors that influence vesiDiscussion .  Overall vesicularity is a function of initial lava flow vesicularity, pressure at the crust-melt interface, and rate of solidification (time available for bubble coalescence) (26). Self et al. (27 further suggested that many characteristics of horizontal vesicular zones noted in flood lavas, notably vesicle-free interiors, may be attributed to lava flow inflation of the type now thought to be common in pahoehoe lavas (28). Cashman and Kauahikaua (26) elaborated on this to show how the characteristic three-fold upper, middle and lower divisions of vesicularity common in lava flows may be controlled in detail by the inflation process and the manner in which vesicle size is a function of correlated with calculated crustal thickening rates (i.e., time available for coalescence) at different depths within a lava flow. The vesicularity at a given level within the lava flow is correlated with confining pressure, a function of overburden and ambient atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure is a major influence on vesiculation during ascent and eruption (29), but because the differences in pressure are much lower in static lavas, supersaturation of gas in lava flows is likely to be less catastrophic in lava flows than partials of magma ascending in conduits. Atmospheric pressure largely influences the vesicularity profile. Because the pressure that satisfies the ideal gas law has both atmospheric and hydrostatic terms, differences in vesicularity are expected to be relatively sensitive to differences in atmospheric pressure in the upper lava section (25; 30 ). cle identification and quantification.

The influence of ambient pressure is manifested in differences in vesicularity gradients over depth. An example of the influence is documented on the basis of changes in vesicle sizes in lava flows that have entered the ocean and subjected to increased hydrostatic pressure (31). Results show that otherwise similar magmas erupted at different ambient pressure conditions record significant differences in the rate of downward increase in volume percent of vesicles, differences
