Introduction:  There is considerable evidence for liquid water on the surface of Mars throughout its geologic history.  For example, remote sensing reveals dendritic channels and gullies that are believed to have been shaped by running water [1-4].  Abundant sulfur and chlorine found in present day Martian materials is believed to have originated from the extreme volcanism that occurred during Martian history [5].  The outgassing of S and Cl at a time in which liquid water was present may have significantly decreased the pH of that water, making acid (as H2SO4 and HCl) capable of severely weathering the underlying basaltic crust. Basaltic weathering experiments under low pH and low temperature indicate that iron-titanium oxides dissolve readily [6,7].  This unforeseen behavior of FeTi oxides demonstrates the need for a better understanding of the reactivity of these oxides because they are significant constituents of the Martian geologic system, yet they have not been widely studied [8-11].  In this study, we examine the alteration of iron-titanium oxides under conditions relevant to Mars.   The compositions of the basaltic shergottite meteorites are in general agreement with the chemical compositions of Martian fines analyzed by the Viking, Pathfinder and MER landers [12-16],  the compositions of Fe-Ti oxides used in this study are based upon those present in five shergottite meteorites as reported by [15,17].  The compositions of the oxides in the meteorites, as well as the oxide compositions used in this study are plotted on the FeO-Fe2O3-TiO2 ternary diagram in Figure 1 for comparison. Fe-Ti oxides are present as minor phases in SNC meteorites and occur in basalts and soils analyzed on the Martian surface [18].  A significant amount of total Fe and nearly all Ti in a basalt is present in the form of these oxides.  In the shergottite meteorites, ulvöspinel (Fe2TiO4) comprises roughly 2.2% by volume, whereas ilmenite (FeTiO3) makes up approximately one half of one percent by volume [15].  The range of solid solution of titanomagnetite minerals usually falls in the Mt18-37Usp63-79 range, while ilmenite minerals are in the range of Ilm96-97Hm1-2 [15,17]. Fe-Ti oxide minerals are very important components on Mars and are very reactive under certain conditions.  Understanding oxide reactivity, in terms of rates of dissolution as well as geochemical reaction products may lead us to a better understanding of the aqueous sedimentary environments that may have operated on Mars in the past.       Experimental Methods:  Static batch experiments with each of the oxide compositions were performed at varying temperature (~8°C, ~25°C, ~70°C) and pH (1.25, 1.90).  The acid mixtures are prepared using varying amounts of deionized water and stock sulfuric acid.  During each batch experiment, ~0.3g of the oxide is allowed to react with ~30g of sulfuric acid in Teflon® screw top beakers.  The beakers are opened once daily for fluid sampling during the two week duration of each experiment.  Each day, pH and temperature are measured and ~0.09g of fluid is extracted from each beaker and diluted with ~1g of 4% HNO3.  Each diluted sample is passed through a 0.20 µm filter to remove ultra fines and stored in the refrigerator until further analyses.   After two weeks of sampling, only ~4% of the total starting volume of the fluid will be removed, thus keeping a relatively constant fluid/rock ratio of 100. After completion of each experiment, the supernatant is separated from the remaining solid and filtered with 0.4 µm filter paper to remove any ultra fine primary materials.  It is then poured into open top Teflon® beakers and allowed to evaporate for several days.  After evaporation, the precipitate is rinsed with denatured ethanol and is stored until further analyses.       After the supernatant is removed, the residual solid is rinsed with denatured ethanol and allowed to completely air dry until further analyses.   Analysis and Results:  Primary oxide mineralogy is determined by x-ray diffraction (XRD).  XRD is also Figure 1 FeO-TiO2-Fe2O3 system showing the Ilm-Hm and Usp-Mt solid solution lines.  Fe-Ti oxide compositions for 5 basaltic shergottite meteorites [15,17] as well as the Fe-Ti compositions used in this study are shown.

Also determined is the mineralogy of the precipitated minerals.  BET surface areas of the primary materials are measured for use in determining the absolute dissolution rates of each oxide composition at varying conditions.   Analysis of fluid samples is carried out by Direct Current Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrophotometry (DCP-AES) to determine the dissolved concentrations of both Fe and Ti.  Detection limits for each of the elements are 0.04 ppm and 0.1 ppm, respectively.   The surface morphology of the residual solid particles, as well as any minerals precipitated from the supernatant, are observed under the scanning electron microscope (SEM).  The solid particles are also analyzed by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to determine elemental composition.  EDS is also used to attempt to quantitatively determine the stoichiometry of each of the new evaporite minerals.  Fe and Ti dissolved readily out of all of oxides in which they were present in substantial quantities.  Concentrations of dissolved Fe and Ti are observed to increase steadily with time in most experiments.  In some cases solution saturation occurred and concentration increased to a point and became steady with time.  Only in cases in which there is high temperature and low pH was a more complex relationship between dissolved concentration and time exhibited, possibly due to both saturation and reprecipitation of secondary minerals before the completion of the experiments.   In all cases, there is an inverse relationship between pH and dissolution rate, as well a direct relationship between temperature and dissolution rate.   The morphology of the residual solids rarely shows differences from the primary materials. At times preferential dissolution at surface defects and layering are observed.   The majority of EDS spectra of re-precipitated minerals (Figure 2) have Fe, S and O peaks (elements with atomic number < 11 are not detectable).  Occasionally, Ti peaks are observed.  Although these minerals have not yet been analyzed quantitatively, it is likely that iron sulfate minerals have formed, although they may be hydrated which would make quantitative analysis difficult.  These minerals have not yet been analyzed by XRD. Discussion and Conclusions:  The dissolution behavior of Fe-Ti oxides has not been studied extensively due to the overall resistance of these minerals to terrestrial conditions.  On Mars, however, it is possible that aqueous environments of low pH and low temperature existed, capable of weathering the basaltic crust, and thus dissolving primary Fe-Ti oxides.                Fe-Ti oxides account for a significant amount of the total Fe and Ti in shergottite basalts, and other Martian basalts.  The dissolution of these primary oxide minerals over short time scales allow for significant amounts of Fe and Ti to be present in solution, and available to be re-precipitated as secondary minerals.   Given that secondary Fe minerals are abundant on the surface of Mars, it is important to constrain the behaviors of all primary oxides that are believed to be present in the Martian crust, throughout a range of pH and temperature. Reaction products as well as rates of dissolution of these minerals will be determined, both of which may provide insight to the understanding of the ancient geologic processes that have, at one time, taken place on the surface of Mars.
