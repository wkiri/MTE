Introduction:  Martian dust mineralogy and atmospheric dust deposition rates and are being investigated by analyzing changes in Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) visible/near-infrared reflectance spectra of the radiometric calibration targets (RCTs) on the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) lander [1] throughout the mission.  Sky brightness models [2] in combination with twolayer radiative transfer models [3] help contrain observations of temporal changes in spectra relevant to better understanding the degree to which dust deposition affects such diverse topics as landed spacecraft operability (solar power availability), surface mineralogy, and aeolian and climate dynamics.  Methodolgy.  The two RCTs on the MPF lander provided a direct reference for radiometric calibration of IMP images, but were subject to airborne dust deposition during the mission [4].  We are using calibrated IMP multispectral images to document spectral changes associated with dust deposition on the white, gray, and black surfaces on the upper RCTs.  RCT images from Sol 3 were assumed to be least contaminated with dust and used to calibrate RCT images acquired on later Sols under similar illuminations (Table 1) using Version 3 of the IMP calibration algorithm [1,5].    Figure 1.  Spectral changes of RCT white ring during MPF mission (calibrated using Sol 3 RCT).   Note reddening of spectral slope and development of ~860 nm band (vertical line).     The effects of dust deposition with time are demonstrated by overall spectral reddening of the RCTs (e.g., increasing red/blue ratios) and the appearance of spectral features such as a broad absorption centered near 860 nm (Figure 1).  Some of these features are anomalous (e.g., near-infrared reflectances greater than the Sol 3 RCT spectrum) and could be related to slight uncompensated photometric variations among the RCT images over widely separated sols.  Therefore, we attempted to compensate for these effects by constructing simulated RCT images using a radiative transfer model of sky illumination for a specific opacity, wavelength, and sun position [2,6].

After using the sky brightness models to correct for differences in illumination conditions and to estimate scattered light onto the RCTs from Mars and the MPF lander, RCT reflectances were less than the Sol 3 target but still showed increased reddening over time and development of the 860 nm band (Figure 2).  The band position of this absorption is consistent with red crystalline hematite, although its band width is sharper than would be expected for hematite and its visible spectrum is more similar to palagonites [e.g., 7,8].  Figure 3 demonstrates a nearly linear increase in  DUST DEPOSITION ON MARS:  J.R. Johnson et al.  the depth of this band (and the 752/480 nm ratio) with time for seven representative sols.    Figure 2.  Spectra of RCT white ring (Figure 3) corrected for illumination differences among RCTs and scattered light from Martian atmosphere and spacecraft.  Note more prominent development of ~860 nm band (vertical line) compared to Figure 1.  Hematite WS 161 spectrum (grain size ~ 6 µm) from USGS library also shown, offset by +0.7.   Figure 3.  752/480 nm ratio (red) and 860 nm band depth (black) for Sols in Figure 2, demonstrating a relatively linear increase in both parameters as a function of time.  Sources of uncertainty.  The sky brightness model developed here relies on measurements of the Martian sky made using a preliminary IMP calibration algorithm [9] and is therefore subject to uncertainty in the sky's spectral behavior, which may include an absorption near 860 nm similar to that observed here [cf. 10].  The sky model does not include a spectral feature at 860 nm, so the feature is not added by the correction process.  However, any real spectral feature is not well corrected by the model.  Future refinements to the sky model will include a simultaneous analysis of sky brightness variations under noon and late afternoon illumination using lower RCT images.  This will minimize residual instrumental calibration uncertainties.  Radiative transfer models.  The RCT spectra are being used in two-layer Hapke radiative transfer scattering models [3] to estimate changes in dust coating thickness on the RCTs and further constrain the dust mineralogy.  These models are currently being refined, but Figure 4 demonstrates our success in solving the firstorder problem of modeling the dust-free RCT materials.  Future work will incorporate spectra of the dustcoated RCTs and thereby help constrain the spectral nature of the dust as well as estimates of its thickness as a function of time.  The methods developed here will be useful for understanding how dust deposition affects calibration of IMP images, and for application to Pancam calibration targets on the MER rover missions.
