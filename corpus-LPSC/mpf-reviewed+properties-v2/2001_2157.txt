 RECENT ADVANCES IN UNDERSTANDING DUST DEVIL PROCESSES AND SEDIMENT FLUX ON EARTH AND MARS. S. M. Metzger, Dept. of Geology, MS-172, University of Nevada, Reno, 89557, metzger@scs.unr.edu       Introduction: In the past several years dust devils have been recognized as major contributors to the airborne particulate loading of and subsequent environmental influence on the atmospheres of Earth and Mars [1].  Because thermally-powered vortical dust columns send many tons of soil to substantial heights over typical arid valleys, such as those studied in Nevada and Peru, they serve to alter the desert surface from which they develop, redistribute materials far afield, modify the atmosphere's thermal dynamics, and eventually add to the composition of their depositional sinks.  Far from being an occasional but insignificant oddity, dust devils are actively reworking the desert environment.        Recent terrestrial fieldwork has indicated that terrestrial dust devils are visible with as little as 30 times the ambient airborne dust concentration but may pump more than 3000 times the ambient PM10 (0.5 to 10 micron diameter) dust load into the atmosphere. Although the substantial sand load (20 to 80 mg/m3) in these vortices is likely to be discharged from the column at a relatively minor height, the fine dust grains are carried several kilometers aloft into regional wind patterns.  The erosive effectiveness of dust devil vortices is due, in part, to wind speeds gusting to 10 m/s within 15 cm of the ground (even among frictional grass-covered surfaces).  Furthermore, patches of highly aerodynamically rough ground (such as fields of 3 m diameter boulders) can readily serve as thermal plume "breeding grounds" sheltered from conventional shear wind. This led to the production of thousands of dust devils per week resuspending volcanic ash from recent eruptions near the Peruvian Andes volcano Sabancaya.  Details of these field efforts will be presented that further link dust devil formation to the surface geology from which they emerge.       Mars Research: To date, at least five dust plume features have been discovered in 16 Mars Pathfinder IMP camera images and interpreted as dust devil vortices [2].  All of the dust devils have been found in portions of the Gallery Panorama sequence taken during the mid-day period of maximum surface heating. [2] estimates total transport by two of the vortices observed by IMP.  Given that most terrestrial dust devils have (1) a dust-free core equal to roughly half their outer diameter, and (2) an average vertical velocity (or "lift") of 7 m/s [1], the average vertical flux of vortices near MPF would be 0.5 g/m2/s, consistent with terrestrial results [1, 3, and this report]. Speculating further, the South Twin Peak dust devil would loft over 2 kg of material during the 35 seconds it was imaged and the larger plume on Big Crater would loft 740 kg during its observed 400 second duration.  In both cases the dust plumes rose over 250 m before extending out of view.        Using the Mars Observer Camera, the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft has now imaged numerous regions where thousands of subparallel tracks are found crossing flat or dune-covered surfaces (Fig. 1). One early observation was on presumably loose, finegrained material at 15.4° N, 311.6° W in eastern Arabia Terra. These have been interpreted to be the tracks of 2 dust devils.  The longer east-west feature is over 7.7 km long before leaving the frame and averages 2.5 pixels (35 m) in width.  [2] speculate that regional winds must have been steady and of moderate intensity (ex. 5 m/s) to produce such near-straight tracks. Therefore, the track would represent a dust devil that lasted at least 24 minutes. Using [2]'s dust loading estimate of  7 x 10-5 kg/m3, (and the 50% clear core, 18m, and 7 m/s lift assumptions of above) the flux would exceed 0.5 g/m2/s, removing 3.5 g/m2 from the surface (as the dust devil base takes 7 seconds to cross a given spot), with total particulate transport exceeding 500 kg. [4] estimated the total sediment load in large dust devils (up to 1 km in width and 6 km in height) in Arcadia Planitia to be 3000 kg.  These numbers are significant in light of the high frequency of strong thermals predicted to act across much of the Martian surface.       The concentration of soil particles in terrestrial dust devils as measured by [1] is on average 3.3 x 104 µg/m3 total suspended particles (total suspended particle, TSP, measured 2 m above ground).  In comparison, ambient atmospheric TSP concentrations on Earth (2 m above ground) average 35 µg/m3 and may reach 718 µg/m3 in such arid environments as Mali, West Africa.  Dust haze events on Earth have ranged from 1.1 x 103 µg/m3 to 1.4 x 104 µg/m3.       Once TSP loading is found (in µg/m3), the soil flux from the surface is derived by knowing the vertical velocity of the vortex.  This involves relating the dust column of the vortex to the upward wind velocity active in that region (interpreted to be approximately 50% less than the maximum vertical velocity found closer to the core [1]).  The terrestrial flux rates of [1, and this report] are very similar to those estimated by [3], classified by dust devil size, as ranging from 0.2 g/m2/s to 3.0 g/m2/s.  The maximum dust concentra RECENT DUST DEVIL ADVANCES:  S.M. Metzger tion reported by [1] exceeded 8.7 x 104 µg/m3, with a vertical flux of 4.4 g/m2/s for a total aeolian transport of over 2 metric tonnes during its 30 minute lifespan. Even the smallest dust devil sampled is calculated to have eroded 30 kg during a 3 minute period producing an airborne concentration of 2.3 x 104 µg/m3 with a flux of 1.5 g/m2/s.  This is a substantial amount of particulate matter to place into the atmosphere, often with regional and global wind systems.       The presence of dust devils indicates those surfaces over which they travel include dust, whether as an air-fall drape or bonded within an abraidable crust, and loose sand-sized clasts or aggregates. This may imply that sand, or sand-sized aggregates, if present, is available for use by the vortices as an abrasive mechanism capable of other aeolian processes, such as the development of rock fluting.  Whether as particle (clast) roughness or form (topographic) roughness, greater surface relief has several effects on aeolian processes.  Large particles absorb or "partition" much of the wind energy that could otherwise be applied to entrain finer surficial material.  If a high enough percentage of the surface is armored by rocks, finer clasts between and under them will be thoroughly protected from erosive winds.  Behind such obstacles, flow separation of the wind from the clast results in a low pressure zone where finer materials find shelter.  Depositional sites become source areas once the wind shifts direction.  [5] found that rocky surfaces store more airfall dust than other surfaces but they subsequently lose up to 80% of that dust before it can be stabilized. Any airfall dust that drapes on top of rocks is already placed well up into the wind profile and is going to reach entrainment threshold speeds far sooner than ground level dust.       Topographic relief acts in much the same manner.  Wind can be compressed as it squeezes over a mound and is therefore more able to erode loose soil. Conversely, the leeward side of the mound can become a depositional sink, until the wind shifts direction.  Depending on orientation to prevailing wind, a wash channel floor might be well sheltered if perpendicular to regional airflow, or provide an aeolian "raceway" if oriented parallel to that flow.  Given that dust devil vortices are characterized by abrupt wind shifts that often swing full circle, many localized depositional sinks become dust sources.  Thus, over time increased roughness can both inhibit and promote the entrainment of fine material.       Ultimately, dust devil activity can reveal a great deal about the surface geologic and aerodynamic characteristics of the Martian surface.  There is a high frequency of dust devil events on diverse arid surfaces on Earth and Mars (as seen in terrestrial field studies, from MPF meteorology and imaging data, and from orbit by Viking and MGS). Those events loft a surprisingly high dust load well into the atmosphere. Therefore the dust devil, once thought to be an interesting oddity, is now seen to strongly contribute to global planetary aeolian transport systems. References: [1] Metzger, Ph.D. Diss.
