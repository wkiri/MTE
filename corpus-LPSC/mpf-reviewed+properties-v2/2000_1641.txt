The principal idea of the instruments was to magnetically attract airborne dust particles onto the surface of the instruments. The attractive force depends on the magnetic properties of the individual dust particles. It is therefore possible to extract information about the the nature of, and constrain the origin of, the magnetic phase known to be present in the Martian fines. The package consisted of three types of instruments; (1) two magnet arrays, (2) one tip plate magnet and (3) two ramp magnets. The instruments contain permanent magnets mounted in a way that produce a wide range of values of the magnetic field and the magnetic field gradient on the surface of the instruments [2]. 1280 130 270 45 349 21 423 11 511 5Magnet # B       [mT] ∇Β     [Tm-1] Figure 1.

The numbers below gives typical values of the magnetic field and magnetic field gradient as measured right at the surface of the instrument. 1. The magnet arrays contained 5 "bull's-eye" magnets (See figure 1). The magnet arrays gave a "rough" measurement of the magnetic properties of the airborne dust, and permitted a spectroscopic investigation using the onboard multispectral imager (the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) [3]). 2. The tip plate magnet (mounted about 7 cm from the imager) was designed to investigate provide high resolution imaging of the pattern formed by the attracted dust. 3. The ramp magnets were magnets mounted at the far end of the two ramps used by the Sojourner Rover to depart from the lander. These magnets were optimized to give a large signal to noise ratio when measuring the elemental composition using the Alpha Proton X-ray spectrometer (APXS) mounted on the Rover. Results were obtained for the Magnet Arrays and the Tip Plate Magnet, but unfortunately not for the Ramp Magnet. due to premature loss of communication with the spacecraft. As previously reported the Magnet Arrays collected dust on 4 (probably 5) magnets (See figure 2). Figure 2. Upper Magnet Arrays as seen on Sol 68 on Mars. A bulls eye dust pattern can clearly be seen on the four strongest magnets (going from right to left). The fifth magnet is partly obscured be the high gain antenna. This has been interpreted [1,4] as being consistent with the Martian drift soil being composed of composite particles where a silicate clay like material is being coated with / cemented by / or contains nanophase ferric iron oxide particles. This ferric oxide must be either the mineral maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) or the mineral magnetite (Fe3O4) because of the strong attraction to the Magnet Arrays. The mineral maghemite is being favored because of the red color of the Martian surface material. The mean saturation magnetization of the Martian drift soil was estimated to be  4±2 Am2kg-1. Spectroscopy The Imager for Mars Pathfinder was a multispectral imager. It should therefore be possible to obtain spectral information about the dust attracted to the Magnet Arrays. It has however proven to be a rather difficult problem to extract such data from the multispectral imaging sequences executed on Mars because of the extremely complex illumination conditions found at the site of the two Magnet Arrays. In general it is difficult to obtain useful spectra of the Martian scene because of the high diffuse sky brightness [5]. Observations of the Magnet Arrays are also affected by the reflected illumination coming off the lander structure itself. This results in an unpredictable, time dependent and highly anisotropic illumination. One result of the "lander" contribution to the illumination is that the onboard photometric calibration target cannot be used to determine the incident illumination. Another inherent problem with spectroscopy of the Magnet Arrays is the question of time. The Magnet Arrays attracted dust slowly. The Magnet Arrays therefore require time to acquire a thick enough dust layer to be measured. At the same time dust has been settling out of the atmosphere all over the lander structure including the photometric calibration surfaces. The quality of the calibration data therefore degrades with time. Magnetic Dust Spectra:  S. F. Hviid et al. It has proven possible to obtain useful spectra of the dust attracted to the lower of the two Magnet Arrays, by making one assumption about the illumination and by using the actual surface of the Magnet Array as a calibration standard. The assumption about the illumination can be expressed by the formula: I(t, λ) = K(t)I0(λ) Where I is the illumination at a given time, I0 is the illumination at a given fixed time and K is a function only of time. 4 0 0 5 0 0 600 7 0 0 800 9 0 0 1000 0.35 0 .40 0 .45 0 .50 0 .55 0 .60 RR RR RR L L L L R L Lower  Magne t  A r ray  P la t i num Sur face   Ma rs  So l70 Labora tory R=R igh t  IMP  eye L=Le f t  IMP eye Re fle ct iv ity ( r L )W a v e l e n g t h  [ n m ] Figure 3. Reflectivity of the surface of the Lower Magnet Array. The top curve represents the Laboratory measurements and the bottom curve represents the corrected spectrum where the sedimented dust has been taken into account. Using the above assumption and image data acquired at different times in the mission, it was possible to produce a corrected reflectivity curve of the surface of the Magnet Array, which could then be used as calibration standard for the measurements of the magnetically attracted dust. The corrected calibration spectrum can be seen in figure 3. Using the corrected calibration curve the following reflectivity spectra of the dust attracted to the strongest magnet on the Lower Magnet Arrays have been produced (See fig. 4). 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 RR RR RR LL L L R L Calibration: Lower PtMagnetic Dust    Magnet #1 Re fle ct an ce ( r L )Wavelength [nm] Figure 4.  Reflectivity spectrum of the dust adhering the strongest magnets of the Lower Magnet Array as seen on sol 70. The curve has been produced using the corrected reflectance curve seen in figure 3 as reference. The reflectance curve has the general shape typical of a ferric mineral. It can however be seen that the reflectivity is much higher than would be expected as compared to the reflectivity measured for the Martian scene in general. Especially the reflectivity in the red end of the spectrum is substantially higher than in spectra from the scene in general. This is caused by the fact that the dust layer on the magnet is not optically infinitely thick. The spectrum as measured is therefore a mixture spectrum of the platinum coated background and the attracted dust. Different schemes can be used to extract the reflectivity spectrum of the dust. A simple method is to use the empirical formula: )()()()( λλλλ SurfaceDust rbarr ++= Where r is the reflectance, λ is the wavelength and a,b are free varying parameters. In figure 5 is seen an extracted dust spectrum produced by fitting the spectrum in figure 4 to the Mars Bright regions spectrum [6] using the wavelengths 440nm and 670nm. 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35   Lower M1 Cylinder Mars Bright Regions Re fle ct an ce ( r L )Wavelength [nm] Figure 5. Extracted magnetic dust spectrum fitted to the Mars bright regions spectrum[6]. Also shown is the Mars bright regions spectrum. As can be seen the resulting dust spectrum fits the Mars bright regions spectrum quite well (within the uncertainty). This leads to the conclusion that the dust attracted to the Magnet Arrays is very likely identical to the drift soil blowing around in the wind on Mars. This again points to the conclusion that the Magnet Arrays are probably not culling a small fraction of the Martian dust but are in fact attracting most of the dust blowing past the active surface. This gives support to the theory that the Martian dust is composed of composite particles, all containing a fraction of a highly magnetic mineral, probably maghemite. [1] S. F.
