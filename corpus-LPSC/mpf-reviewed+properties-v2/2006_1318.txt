Introduct ion:  The Pathfinder, Spirit and Opportunity missions revealed that Martian soils are enriched in chlorine (up to 0.5 wt% Cl [1]). No Clrich minerals except hydrothermal alteration products such as clay-rich veinlets and massive halite within olivine from Nakhla have yet been detected in SNC Martian meteorites. We describe the first extraterrestrial Cl-rich amphibole, in the newly found nakhlite MIL 03346, believed to come from the top of the nakhlite magmatic pile [2]. General description of MIL 03346: The nakhlite MIL 03346 exhibits large augite phenocrysts (72 %) and rare (less than 4%) porphyritic olivine (up to 2 mm, Fig. 1a and Fig. 2a) set in an abundant (24 %) dark mesostasis with subsidiary phases showing quench textures. The present work focuses on the vitrophyric melt inclusions (MI) trapped in augite and olivine. Augite-hosted MI (Fig.2) are larger (100µm) compared to olivine-hosted MI (Fig.1) and show irregular shape (Fig.2b-c-d-f-g). Most of them display an overall composition similar to the mesostasis. A small number (about 20% of the MI our section of about 1 cm2) exhibits however unusual mineralogy and chemistry [3]. MI mineralogy: beside augite, olivine, silica-rich phase, low Ca pyroxene and oxides common to most of MI, we found exotic minerals such as Cl-rich amphibole, Cl-poor smectite and phosphate. They define three types of MI: (I) standard MI with mineral composition similar to the mesostasis (Fig. 1 b-c and Fig.2 b-c-e-f) (II) olivine-hosted MI with Clamphibole, chromite, smectite and apatite (Fig. 1 dh); (III) augite-hosted MI with Cl-amphibole, K-rich glass, Fe-Ti oxide, apatite and smectite (Fig.2 g-h). MI Chemistry: several odd features are observed in type II and type III MI. The amphibole is a chloropotassichastingsite : (K0.7-0.36 Na0.26-0.36) Ca1.89-1.48 ((Mn 0.03 Mg 0.17-2 Fe 2+ 3.89-1.53 Fe 3+ 0.94-0.97)) (Si 6.2 - 6.4 Al 1.89-1.47 O22) Cl 2.09-0.4 OH 0.79-1.60 . It is zoned at micron scale within type II and type III MI: chlorine contents ranges from 1.53 to 7 wt%. It thus differs from the Ti-rich amphibole (kaersutite) described previously in MI within basaltic shergottite and Chassigny [4]. Fig.1 BSE images and X-Ray mapping of melt inclusion in olivine Fig.2 BSE images and X-Ray mapping of melt inclusion in augite  The abundance of sulfure in the glass exceeds that expected for a melt in equilibrium with iron sulfide and containing about 60 % silica. The chlorine content in the glass of about 5000 ppm added to chlorine from amphibole (3.5 % on average) exceeds 2%, a reasonable Cl content for a melt. Finally these Cl-rich amphibole are relatively high in Fe3+ . Interpretation: composition variability of MI indicates that they cannot result from a single entrapment episode of an early melt. At least another component is required which contains significant amounts of Cl and S. A fluid phase can be excluded since the odd phases are never observed as fracture filling materials along mineral boundary or as patches within the mesostasis. We know from in situ-analysis of Martian soil that abundant chloride and sulfate are present at the surface of Mars in soil. Therefore small amount of soil component (presumably debris of evaporitic sediment) could have been trapped within lava flow upon the eruption. Small particles were trapped with melt as magmatic inclusions in growing phenocrysts. Their subsequent reaction with the melt resulted in the odd mineralogy described above. In the remaining melt (mesostasis) this contamination remains cryptic due to dilution effect and possible volatilization. Further evidence for assimilation of particles  from the highly oxidized regolith would be the high Fe3+ concentration observed in MIL 03346 (both in bulk rock and mineral phases, [5]). Our interpretation confirms that nakhlites represents thick lava flow erupted at the Martian surface. Late secondary hydrothermal alteration (Cl-poor smectite) results from reactions at the surface and could therefore evidence melting of the pergelisol below the magmatic pile.
