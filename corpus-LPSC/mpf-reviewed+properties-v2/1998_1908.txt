 LAYERING IN THE UPPER CRUST OF MARS SEEN IN VALLES MARINERIS BY THE MARS ORBITAL CAMERA. A.S. McEwen1 and M.C. Malin2; 1 Lunar and Planetary Lab (Univ. of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721; mcewen@lpl.arizona.edu), 2 Malin Space Science Systems, San Diego, CA 92191. Summary MOC has discovered that the wall rock cut by Valles Marineris is almost entirely composed of laterally extensive layers from 5 to 50 m thick.   This layering extends to the deepest exposures seen, more than 5 km below the plateau surface.  Hence, the upper crust in this region does not appear to consist of megabreccia and fractured bedrock (under a relatively thin layer of lavas capping the plateau) as previously believed.  For several reasons it is much more likely that the layers consist of volcanics rather than fluvial or eolian sedimentary rocks.  This implies that Late Noachian/Early Hesperian volcanism was much more voluminous than previously believed, which in turn has implications for the differentiation of Mars, early climate, and structure of the crust that produced the canyons, outflow channels, and wrinkle ridges. Observations The Mars Orbital Camera (MOC) was designed to acquire images at up to 1.5 m/pixel resolution from a 400-km circular orbit [1].  During aerobraking in an elliptical orbit in late 1997 and early 1998 it has been possible to acquire images at about 4-10 m/pixel resolution [2].  These images show that layering is ubiquitous in the walls of Valles Marineris, extending from 15 S, 40 W to 5 S, 93 W.   MOC has acquired N-S trending image strips over the canyon system during eight out of the first 80 orbits: orbit 13 (longitude 90 W; see Figure 1), orbit 26 (96 W), orbit 35 (71 W), orbit 51 (91 W), orbit 63 (69 W), orbit 69 (82 W), orbit 79 (42 W), and orbit 80 (56 W).  Where bedrock is exposed, the layering is seen throughout the entire depth of the canyon.  The canyon floor is as much as 11 km below the plateau surface, but we do not yet have high-resolution images of the deepest exposures of wall rock.  The dominant morphology of the chasm walls consists of steep spurs and gullies [3]; at all locations imaged at better than 10 m/pixel by MOC, the spurs consist of layers varying from about 5 to 50 meters in thickness.  (We estimated layer thicknesses by measuring the layer widths on the images and assuming 20 degree slopes.)  The layering is relatively poorly expressed at the extremes of longitude, in Noctus Labyrinthus (96 W) and in the eastern troughs transitional to outflow channels (42 W), but it is unclear whether the layering itself is less prevalent or whether it simply isn't as well exposed where the canyon walls are not as steep and high. The layering described here has not been seen previously.  Layering has been seen from Viking and Mariner 9 images in the Valles Marineris interior deposits, which formed within the canyons.  In the preexisting wall rock layering has been seen previously only in the uppermost layer (less than 1 km thick), and isolated or patchy dark layers have been seen in the south Coprates Chasm and the north wall of Ophir Chasm [4].  Many previous workers have assumed that the stratigraphy near Valles Marineris consisted of less than 1 km of layered lavas overlying predominantly impact megabreccia and fractured bedrock [3,5-7], similar to models for the lunar stratigraphy.  However, megabreccia should be only very crudely layered and fractured bedrock unlayered, so this assumption now appears to have been incorrect.  We have seen what looks like massive fractured bedrock at one location (15 S, 56 W), but the wall rock is predominantly (>90%) layered.   The layers must belong to the Upper Noachian or Lower Hesperian stratigraphic series (3.1 to 4.2 b.y.) as they underlie the Lower Hesperian ridged plains material [5] but do not appear modified by late heavy bombardment. Discussion What is the composition of the layers?  They appear to consist of alternate dark ledges and brighter slopes, with the brighter slopes perhaps due to coatings of eolian dust.  In places there also appear to be brighter layers of in situ bedrock, which imply variations in the composition or alteration of the layers.  We interpret the composition of the strata as predominantly volcanic flows because: (i) the geologic units on the surrounding plateau surface probably consist of volcanic flows [8]; (ii) the layer thicknesses and ledge-forming topography are typical of terrestrial flood basalts such as the Columbia River Basalts [9]; (iii) the dark layers previously identified have spectral and other properties consistent with mafic glass [4]; and (iv) high heat flows expected on Mars during this time period could produce such voluminous volcanism [10]. If these layers actually consist primarily of a 5- to 10km thick section of fluvial or eolian sedimentary rocks, then we must dramatically revise our thoughts on Martian geologic history.  Studies of degraded craters in the ancient highlands suggest that only ~200 meters of highland material has been eroded and redistributed, with mostly local deposition [11].  If erosion on Mars had been sufficient to produce such a thick and extensive stack of sediments, we might not expect any ancient highlands to be preserved on Mars. Why does the upper ~400 m of canyon wall appear more resistant than lower layers?  Layering in the upper canyon walls has been interpreted as most likely due to lava flow cooling units [3].  However, if the lower layers are also lava flows, then some additional explanation for the difference is competency is needed.  The discontinuity may mark the base of the cryosphere [12,13], with differences in chemical and mechanical processes and resultant weathering, or it has been proposed that the upper layers were modified by diagenesis [14].  It is also possible that the upper layers are composed of lavas with a different composition or emplacement mechanism. The Ridged Plains lavas of Lunae Planum was estimated from partially flooded craters to be a wedge of material ranging up to a maximum thickness of 600 m along its western margin [15].  The partially buried craters are generally sparse, except along the eastern and southern margins.   The flooded crater method for estimating plainsunit depths relies on an assumption that the lava emplacement was rapid compared to the cratering rate.  We suggest that the partially buried craters rest on older lavas so LAYERING OF THE UPPER CRUST OF MARS:  A.S. McEwen and M.C. Malin that the total thickness of the plains cannot be estimated in this manner. The identification of extensive early volcanism on Mars, if confirmed by subsequent observations, will contribute to our understanding of many geologic problems. For example, the steep, high walls of Valles Marineris require competent geologic materials, which may be difficult to explain with impact breccia, but is satisfied by lavas [3]. Stacks of basaltic lava may have very high permeabilities due to lava tubes, so thick sections of lavas could help to explain the later development of outflow channels from confined aquifers [16].  The voluminous early volcanism may help explain the unexpected abundance of more evolved compositions at the Pathfinder landing site [17]. How voluminous were these early volcanics?  The areal extent of the layered deposits spans at least the entire Valles Marineris, about 4000 km long.   Most of the surrounding plateau surface is covered by Hesperian aged geologic units.  If most Early Hesperian volcanic plains on Mars are ~10 km thick rather than ~0.2 km assumed by [18], then the total quantity of volcanics erupted on Mars could be increased by as much as a factor of 20.   Alternatively, the lava could be much less extensive if the formation of Valles Marineris was intimately associated with the eruption of the lava sequence, such that it thins rapidly away from the canyons.   If confined to the area of a rectangle enclosing the canyons (~4 x 106 km2) and 10 km thick, then the total volume is 40 x 106 km3; this alone increases an estimate for the total volume of extruded volcanics on Mars [18] from 69 x 106 km3 to 109 x 106 km3.  Thus, if the layers are indeed volcanic, volcanism on Mars was much more extensive than previously believed, which in turn must have affected the climate and release or sequestering [19] of water on Mars.
