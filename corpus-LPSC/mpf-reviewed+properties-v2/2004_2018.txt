Introduction:  As part of an ongoing effort to demonstrate the utility of using in-situ neutron spectroscopy to measure water content on planetary surfaces [1,2], we have developed a field site for carrying out neutron spectroscopy measurements.  Specifically, our objectives in developing the field site are:  1) Demonstrate in-situ neutron measurements in a realistic field test scenario; 2) Demonstrate our ability to accurately model neutron measurements for various conditions and identify measurement factors that need to be controlled and/or accounted for such as detailed stratigraphy; 3) Provide a field test location for future in-situ neutron measurements using a variety of instrument and soil configurations. Test Site Overview:  The test site is within soils developed on flat overbank deposits at the bottom of Pajarito Canyon at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The dominant soil type at this location is a canyon bottom soil developed from dacitic to rhyolitic volcanic sources.  We simulated subsurface water deposits by burying 122cm x 122cm slabs of high-density polyethylene (CH2, density=0.95 g/cm 3) of various thicknesses (1.27-10 cm) to various depths (5-30 cm) (see Fig. 1).  For the current measurements, we used polyethylene (or poly) because, A) Its hydrogen content is similar to water (and neutrons respond primarily to hydrogen); B) Its easier to handle than containers of water; and C) It has a long term stability so we can revisit the site and know its composition will not change over time. To simulate a planetary rover, we modified a commercial remote control vehicle to carry two 3He neutron detectors (Fig. 2a).  One tube is covered in 0.6 mm thick Cd to measure epithermal neutrons and the other tube is covered in 0.6 mm thick Sn to measure thermal + epithermal neutrons.  The rover also had a holder for a 252Cf neutron source, which has a strength of 5.7 x 106 n/s.  The neutron source simulates cosmic ray and/or RTG produced neutrons.  Note, however, that cosmic ray produced neutrons are sensitive to water down to 70 cm, while RTG and 252Cf neutrons are more sensitive to shallower deposits [1].  For this test, the neutron detectors were read out using laboratory electronics and a laptop computer (Fig. 2b).  For future tests, we will use battery powered, autonomous electronics currently in development [2] that will be controlled wirelessly from a laptop computer.   High-precision measurements (<1% statistics), were made in 2  - 3 minutes at 13 different locations having various poly thicknesses and burial depths.  Fig. 3 shows an example where the rover traversed a 3.8 cm thick poly layer buried by 5 cm of soil.  The effect of the poly is clearly seen in both thermal and epithermal neutrons. Modeling the measurements: We used MCNPX, a LANL developed nuclear particle transport code, to model the entire field set up, including the rover, in a manner similar to previous work [1].  To model the soil composition, we determined the elemental content of the soil using laboratory X-ray fluorescence for major elements (e.g., Fe, Si, Ti, etc.), soil leaching for some trace elements (e.g., Cl), and moisture analysis for soil water content.  Soil samples were taken at four different locations across the test site and the variations in major element abundances were less than 10%.  Some of the major elements were very different from a Marstype composition (Fe and Si were 1.5 and 35 wt.% at the site compared to 15.6 and 19.8 wt.% for a Pathfinder composition [3]).  The water content from three different locations on the day of measurement (3.2 wt.±0.6% H2O), showed a larger variation of ∼18% across the site, but is quite similar to the driest locations on Mars [4].   Results and discussion:  Fig. 4 shows both measured and modeled counting rates for a single poly slab thickness (1.27 cm) as a function of depth.  The count rate error bars on the measurements are estimated using multiple measurements at single poly locations.  The depth error bars show uncertainty in the poly depth over the poly slab area (e.g., due to undulations in the surface materials).  Since we have not yet made an absolute efficiency measurement for these 3He tubes (the efficiency for particular 3He tubes can vary by ±20% [5]), we have normalized the model in each case to bare soil.  As shown, the model matches the data quite well for many data points.  There are two depths, however, for both thermal and epithermal neutrons (5 and 12 cm) where the data are ∼15% higher than the model.  Possible sources for this discrepancy are unaccounted variations in soil water content, depth to poly variations, soil density, and/or other soil composition variations.  Further work is underway to quantify the relative effect of these and other possible sources of error.   These initial results demonstrate a number of important points:  1)  We have successfully carried out insitu neutron measurements using a realistic field test scenario.  Buried hydrogen (and hence water) is clearly and easily identified with these measurements;  2)  We have been able to accurately model the counting rate behavior for both thermal and epithermal neutrons.  In near term future work, we expect to model the absolute count rates by accurately determining the absolute effi  ciency of our particular 3He tubes; 3) We have an operational field test site that will allow us to carry out future measurements having an increasing complexity of instrumentation and soil/stratigraphy configurations.
