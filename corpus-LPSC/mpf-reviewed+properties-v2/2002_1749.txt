Introduction:  Carbonates, sulfates, and chlorides have been proposed to occur on Mars on the basis of theoretical and experimental calculations, Viking and Pathfinder lander data of duricrusted and loose sediments, and meteorite data of the Shergottite-NakhliteChassignite (SNC) suite and ALH84001 thought to be derived from Mars.  These minerals have suggested origins that include various combinations of water, rock, and atmosphere interactions.  The studies that have focused on the interaction between water and mafic igneous rocks include [1-7].  The interaction of the Martian atmosphere with both water and rocks has also received attention by various authors [e.g., 1,8-13].  The experimental sampling of Mars both directly (at the Viking and Pathfinder sites) and indirectly (studying Martian meteorites) also has led to the predictions of carbonates, sulfates, and chlorides on Mars [e.g., 1,2,14-33]. Regardless of the identification of these waterrelated minerals in Martian meteorites and their predicted occurrence on Mars, to date, there has been no definitive identification of these minerals in situ.  Even telescopic observations of Mars have offered only small upper limits to the amount of carbonates on the surface (3-5 wt % for calcite and 5% for magnesite [34]).  Carbonates, sulfates, and chloride minerals, if present at greater than ~10 % the surface of Mars, should be detectable using the technique of thermal emission spectroscopy that utilizes the midinfrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Within this range, a majority of minerals produce diagnostic absorption features that result from the fundamental vibrational modes of the mineral [e.g., 35-38].  The Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) aboard the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, to date, has not detected these minerals [39] even though the instrument functions over the thermal infrared wavelengths.  This negative result may be due to these salt minerals being either dispersed as a fine-grained (<10 Âµm) powder within the global dust, being buried underground, occurring as smaller deposits than the spatial footprint of the TES (~3 x 6 km) [39], or being present only in low abundances, if they are present on Mars at all.  The THEMIS instrument aboard the Mars Odyssey spacecraft, however, may allow for their detection due to the smaller spatial resolution of the instrument (100 m/pixel) and its ability to discriminate Martian surface units using multispectral imaging.  This approach will allow for distinct units that occur as much smaller outcroppings than would have been observable by telescopic observation or by the TES instrument to be discerned and identified. Objective:  The objective of this work is to preliminarily investigate the spectral behavior of salt minerals at THEMIS resolution in order to assess what the spectra returned from the Mars Odyssey mission may reveal about the carbonates, sulfates, and chlorides that may be present on the surface. Samples and Laboratory Spectra:  The broad salt mineral classes exhibit unique thermal infrared emissivity spectra (Figure 1) as a result of their different mineral structures.  Within each mineral class, the Figure 1:  Thermal infrared emissivity laboratory spectra of salt minerals including chloride (halite), sulfate (gypsum), and carbonate (magnesite and calcite). Spectra are offset for clarity.  structurally associated cation alters the spectrum and produces additional variations in the emissivity spectra of a single class of minerals, as shown for carbonate in Figure 1 [40].  The large diversity of salt mineral compositions results in a large diversity of salt spectra.  The THEMIS instrument has a much lower spectral resolution than the laboratory spectrometer used to obtain the spectra shown in Figure 1, so Figure 2 provides examples of some salt mineral emissivity spectra at THEMIS resolution.  Even at the low spec- tral resolution of the THEMIS, the mineral bands are distinguishable.  Chloride minerals are an exception, in that they exhibit fairly flat infrared emissivity spectra.  However, their presence can be deduced because if chloride is contaminated with another geological material, the emissivity spectrum behaves quite differently and produces mineral features in "transmission" of the contaminants that are superposed on  0.40.40.40.4 0.60.60.60.6 0.80.80.80.8 1.01.01.01.0 2002002002004004004004006006006006008008008008001000100010001000120012001200120014001400140014001600160016001600 Em is siv it yE mis siv it yE mis siv it yE mis siv it yHalite Gypsum Magnesite Calcite 0.60.60.60.6 0.80.80.80.8 1.01.01.01.0 1.01.01.01.0  UPCOMING THEMIS INVESTIGATION OF SALTS ON MARS:  M.

The THEMIS spectra of Mars will be investigated thoroughly for a range of salt minerals (whether evaporite deposits, rock rinds, or soil components, etc.).  Using the calibrated THEMIS images and the derived 9-point spectra, comparisons of the Mars data to spectra of known terrestrial salt minerals will be conducted to identify their presence on Mars.  The THEMIS data, being so low in spectral resolution, may only provide information as to the broad classes of salts that are present on Mars. It is anticipated that data returned by THEMIS will indicate areas of mineralogical interest for salts that can be studied in more spectral detail by revisiting the pertinent MGS TES data that are of much higher spectral resolution (143 and 246 bands for TES versus 9 bands for THEMIS).
