Introduction:   Chemical analyses of rocks at the Mars Pathfinder landing site suggest there are quartznormative igneous rocks on Mars [1,2].  This result surprised many in the community because SNC-related meteorites are dominated by mafic to ultramafic mineral assemblages [e.g., 3] and because the morphologies of most volcanic structures on Mars appear to have been produced by mafic to ultramafic lavas [e.g., 4].  However, there is petrological and geochemical evidence from meteorites, often overlooked, that supports the idea of quartz-normative igneous rocks on Mars, particularly in the ancient cratered highlands which were drained by Ares Vallis to produce the deposits in Chryse Planitia at the Mars Pathfinder landing site.  In this paper, we review how quartz-normative igneous rocks are produced and why one might expect them on Mars. Producing Siliceous Rocks from Chondritic Reservoirs: Planetary bodies that accreted from the solar nebula have, to first order, chondritic compositions. The silicate portions of these materials are dominated by olivine and pyroxene (or their high pressure equivalents), two minerals characteristic of mafic to ultramafic rocks. Chondritic compositions, while containing a feldspathic component, are not siliceous.  Consequently, to produce siliceous igneous rocks, the original chondritic reservoirs must be fractionated to produced silica-enriched fluids. This fractionation can occur by partial melting, fractional crystallization, or a combination of these processes.  This has clearly occurred on Earth, which has a varied suite of andesitic, dacitic, and rhyolitic volcanic rocks (and a comparable suite of plutonic rocks).  However, processes leading to such highly evolved rocks are not commonly attributed to other planetary bodies.  Nonetheless, there is evidence that these processes can occur elsewhere in the solar system.  A siliceous igneous rock clast was found in the ordinary chondrite Bovedy [5].  This sample was composed of orthopyroxene, trydimite (SiO2), feldspar, sodic glass, pigeonite, and chromite.  It was produced from a siliceous magma with ~57.5 wt.% SiO2, which is approximately an andesitic composition by terrestrial standards. The chemical and isotopic composition of this clast suggests  it was produced by igneous differentiation of a chondritic reservoir in the vicinity of ordinary chondrite parent bodies.  This is especially significant in our discussion of Mars, because it implies that igneous differentiation can produce siliceous magmas very quickly.  Although the radiometric age of the clast was not determined, it was likely produced from a magma within 100 Ma of solar nebula formation because small planetesimals cool so quickly.  This implies that there is plenty of time for differentiation processes to produce siliceous lithologies on larger planetary bodies like Mars. Evidence for Siliceous Igneous Rocks on Mars: Not only is it theoretically possible for igneous differentiation to produce siliceous rocks on a large planet like Mars, there is petrological and geochemical evidence for siliceous lithologies among the SNC-related meteorites. J There are euhedral inclusions of silica in the cumulate orthopyroxene in Martian meteorite ALH84001 (Fig. 1) [6].  These inclusions indicate the magma that produced this rock was silica oversaturated, even though the meteorite's ultramafic composition appears more indicative of silica-undersaturated conditions. J Several of the shergottite-type Martian meteorites contain magmatic inclusions with silica-rich phases.  For example, LEW88516 contains magmatic inclusions with a 95 wt.% SiO2 glass and a 65 wt.% SiO2 glass (Fig. 2) [7].  These inclusions indicate that fractional crystallization can produce siliceous magmas from mafic shergottite-type magmas on Mars.  There are many examples of these types of inclusions [8-10]. J Rare earth element compositions of shergottites suggest they were produced from magmas that had assimilated a LREE-enriched component [11].  LREEenriched components are often associated with siliceous lithologies which, in this case, could have been in the crust of Mars. J As pointed out previously by Longhi [12], if there was sufficient H2O in the source region of Martian primordial melts, then melt extraction would have produced an andesitic crust.  While we still do not know how much H2O was in the Martian primordial mantle, it is clear that H2O was a component of younger magmas on Mars [e.g., 13,14]. Geologic Locations of Siliceous Igneous Rocks: The respective crystallization ages of ALH84001 and the shergottites suggest that siliceous igneous rocks could have been produced on Mars throughout its entire geologic history.  ALH84001 is ~4.5 Ga, which means it is a sample of some of the earliest crust on Mars.   In contrast, the shergottites were produced as recently as ~180 to ~330 Ma. Because ALH84001 is so old, we previously suggested [6] that siliceous igneous rocks may exist in the ancient cratered highlands of Mars.  In addition, because Ares Vallis drained the highlands and deposited material in Chryse Planitia, we suspected that these siliceous lithologies could be found at the Mars Pathfinder landing site.  Thus, the siliceous rocks at the SILICEOUS ROCKS ON MARS: D. A. Kring and J. D. Gleason landing site may be from the same geologic province as ALH84001, including outcrops of ancient crustal rocks that some [2] have argued may occur in the vicinity of the landing site. The silica-rich inclusion in LEW 88516 suggests that siliceous magmas could also be produced much later in Mars' history, ~180 to ~330 Ma.  This implies there could also be siliceous rocks in much younger terranes on Mars. Conclusions: The SNC-related Martian meteorites have petrologic and geochemical properties that suggest there may have been siliceous magmas on Mars.  The siliceous rocks at the Mars Pathfinder landing site, assuming they are igneous lithologies or are derived from siliceous igneous lithologies, could be from the same geologic province as Martian meteorite ALH84001 which has tentatively been linked to the ancient cratered highlands.  Interestingly, this is consistent with several structures in the highland regions of Mars that are interpreted to have been produced by siliceous volcanism [15-17].  However, the siliceous magmatic inclusions in the shergottite-type Martian meteorites suggests that siliceous magmas could also exist in much younger terranes. References:  [1] Rieder R. et al.
