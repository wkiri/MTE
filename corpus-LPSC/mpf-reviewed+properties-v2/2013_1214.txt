They are characterized by diagnostic textures such as facets, flutes, grooves, and mm-scale and smaller lineations aligned with the direction of high energy saltation [1]. Planetary environments with frequent strong winds and well-exposed and relatively unconsolidated sand contain ventifacts, the study of which provides an integrated record of the relative intensity and direction of winds above threshold [2]. The requirements for ventifact formation make them common features within Earth's deserts, beaches, and glacial margins, and on Mars [1-4]. On the Martian surface, they have been found at the Pathfinder, Spirit, and Opportunity landing regions. These ventifacts have been used to map the direction of high speed winds and infer the aeolian environment over time [3-6].  The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover provides a new mobile field platform in which to study ventifacts. With abundant migrating dunes [7] and a central mound which may have been eroded and exhumed by aeolian processes [8-9], the landing site in Gale Crater is a potential bountiful location to further understand ventifacts and abrasion on Mars. Four imaging investigations can be used to study ventifacts and rock textures. Data from three of them, Navcam, Mastcam, and MAHLI are currently being studied by the Curiosity science team and will be integrated with this study in the future. This report focuses on ventifact studies using the Remote Micro-Imager (RMI) on the ChemCam instrument [10]. RMI's primary purpose is to document the location of fired spots from the Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) component of ChemCam, with pre- and post-LIBS imaging. However, it is an excellent imager in its own right [11,12]. With a pixel scale of 20 µrad and an effective resolution of about twice this value (~80-280 µm for standard RMI distances of 2-7 m), it is the highest resolution remote imager on MSL. Z-stacks can be used to get depth information, with the possibility of deriving detailed microtopography and merges can be made with Mastcam color [12]. Here we summarize observations of ventifacts and abrasion textures seen by RMI through Sol 100 of MSL's mission. We discuss location and textural attributes, and conclude with some preliminary inferences on the aeolian abrasion environment in the area traversed thus far by Curiosity.  Methods  All radiometrically-corrected [11] RMI images were examined and categorized into those that showed definitive rock abrasion textures, possible examples, or none at all. Where available, spatiallyoffset pre- and post-LIBS RMI images were mosaicked together. A limited number of z-stacks and RMI images with overlapping Mastcam color were also studied.   Results  As of Sol 100, RMI had imaged 32 rock or rocksoil mixture targets. This does not include small pebbles within many soils. Of these targets, 9 have distinctive ventifact attributes, 12 have textures that could be from wind abrasion or have other origins, and the remaining 11 are inconsistent with a ventifact origin. The definitive ventifacts are:   Rock   Textures Coronation  facets, keels Mara   flutes Peacock Hills  flutes Thor Lake  flutes Preble   flutes Jake facets, keel, flutes, elongated pits, lineations, basal sill Rocknest 6 flutes, lineations Pearson   flutes, elongated pits Rocknest 3 flutes, elongated pits   The ventifacts are all within the "HUM" (hummocky) unit mapped based on geomorphology (Fig. 1). They are concentrated within the blast zone and the Rocknest area (beginning and last part of traverse, respectively), although this is probably selectively biased by the greater number of rocks examined in these areas compared to other parts of the traverse. All the ventifacts look like float rocks. The most distinctive ventifacts are Coronation, Mara, and Jake (Fig. 2, 3, and 4, respectively). All of the ventifacts have features that are analogous to abrasion textures found on Earth. Coronation in RMI displays distinct cm-scale facets, similar to small ventifacts on Earth for which multiple facets have been attributed to shifting due to natural or human disturbance [1,13]. In the case of Mars and Coronation as representative of small ventifacts, shifting could occur from aeolian wind or seismic shaking from impacts, Mara has cm-scale pits on its left side (as seen in RMI) that transition to grooves on the upper face. In contrast, the primary grain texture seems preserved on the right side. This indicates abrasion and strong sand-laden winds from the left, with no rock rotation. Jake has the most prominent abrasion textures seen so far, with a distinct keel at its crest, penetrating flutes, elongated pits, lineations, and a basal sill (Fig. 4)  Fig. 1: Rover traverse path through Sol 100, with labeled ChemCam sample locations. Prominent ventifacts have black text.  Fig. 2: Radiometrically processed [11] RMI image mosaic of Coronation rock. Note the facets separated by sharp keels. Discussion  The close similarity to analog ventifacts on Earth strongly suggests that the Martian examples are also wind-abraded features that formed over long time scales. The lack of prominent sand and drift deposits in the region of the 100 sol traverse, as seen both from the rover and in HiRISE images, as well as the presence of basal sills and perched rocks in other areas, indicates that the local terrain has undergone deflation. Therefore, sand probably passed through this area in the past, even if not abundant today. This suggests that the ventifacts are fossil features that are not currently undergoing active abrasion.  These preliminary observations show that Gale Crater, like other areas of Mars, has experienced aeolian abrasion similar in result to occurrences on Earth. RMI is an effective tool for studying ventifacts at high resolution, for which elemental abundance data on rock coatings and interiors can also be obtained. The Curiosity mission is just beginning and, with expected visits to bedrock outcrops, regions near migrating dunes, yardang-like materials, and exhumed terrains planned over the next few years, the record of aeolian abrasion should be further unraveled.

Note grooves on top surface and heavy pitting at left, in contrast to the relatively unabraded side at right in which primary grain texture is well preserved.   Fig. 4: Jake ventifact. At top is a Mastcam 100  image with superposed RMI mosaics shown in grayscale and the location of LIBS spots as red dots. The rightmost RMI mosaic is enlarged at lower left, with merged Mastcam color at lower right [12]. The RMI images show prominent gauge marks and lineations that are consistent with aeolian abrasion.
