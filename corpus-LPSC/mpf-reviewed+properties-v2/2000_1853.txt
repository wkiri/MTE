Introduction:  Measurement and interpretation of wind profiles on Mars is motivated by the importance of martian aeolian activity established by decades of telescopic observation, analysis of spacecraft images from orbit and from the surface, and experimental work. The Imager for Mars Pathfinder[1] (IMP) windsock experiment was a simple, low-mass component of the IMP investigation that allowed measurement of the wind profile on the martian surface, a capability not otherwise available on the lander payload, and not previously available on the Viking landers[2].  The IMP windsocks measured wind speed as a function of height close to the surface, where wind energy is transferred to potentially mobile materials.  This capability allowed direct measurement on the surface of Mars for the first time of aerodynamic roughness (z0), and wind friction speed (u*), the two key wind profile parameters for evaluating the potential of wind to move surface particles.  Aerodynamic roughness z0 is an intrinsic property of the surface and is invariant with wind speed.  Wind friction speed u* is a time-variable indication of drag on the surface due to wind, and is the most important indicator of the potential for wind to move fine particles across the surface.  Most saltation transport relationships predict particle flux as a function of u* 3. Measurements of wind speed at two or more heights are generally required for z0 and u* to be determined simultaneously and unambiguously.  Once z0 is determined, wind speed at only a single height (e.g., from the ASI/Met wind sensor) is sufficient for monitoring u*.  Operations on the Surface.  Wind profile information was obtained using IMP sequence S0173, a 100-second, 12-image sequence that was activated 1-4 times per sol starting on sol 3 whenever downlink allocations and resource needs of other IMP objectives permitted.  S0173 usually was activated near local noon, because qualitative data from the ASI/Met wind sensor suggested stronger daylight winds were more likely to occur around local noon and into the early afternoon.  Repetitive imaging of the windsocks during each sequence activation helped to average short-term wind fluctuations.  Data Analysis and Results.  A wind profile consists of average wind velocities obtained simultaneously at two or more heights, and deriving this information from image data involves several steps.  IMP orientation relative to local martian vertical is obtained from IMP pointing recorded during windsock imaging, and the direction of lander tilt measured by onboard accelerometers.  This information establishes the orientation of the windsock image plane.  Windsock deflection angle θ (from local vertical) and wind azimuth φ (clockwise from N) are determinable by geometrically transforming two image measurements: (1) clock angle of the windsock in the image plane; and (2) apparent foreshortening of the windsock, an angle into or out of the image plane.  Windsock deflection θ is converted to wind speed u by applying the relevant wind tunnel calibration data.  Seventy-three IMP S0173 wind profile activations were performed on 49 separate sols from sol 3 to sol 82.   Most of these data were eventually eliminated after inspection or partial reduction showed that derived windsock deflections from local vertical were too small (i.e., light or no wind) to be related reliably to even the lowest speed laboratory calibration data.  A large portion of additional data showed movement of the windsocks between successive images, but not consistently at sufficiently large deflections for calibrations to be applied; thus these data, too, were discarded.  Data for the strongest, best winds for wind profile analysis were obtained on sols 13, 30, 52, and 58.  After estimating zero-plane displacement, d, least-squared fits were applied to these data  to determine aerodynamic roughness z0 in a method analogous to Bagnold[3], Lettau[4], and many others (Figure 1).  Windsock deflections at the bottom windsock position were strong enough for inclusion only for the azimuth 004 wind data.  Winds from azimuth 271 on sol 30 indicate a zerowind intercept height significantly greater than other data.  This is consistent with the sol 30 wind profile azimuth being close to the obstruction zone of the main lander body (azimuths 290 to 322), as well as wind from this azimuth having to cross the neighboring (rover storage) petal with its additional unretracted air bag obstructions and rover ramp components before encountering the ASI/Met mast.  In essence, the sol 30 data in Fig. 1 represent the windsock array ÒdetectingÓ the location of the main lander body.  The other wind data show lower intercepts that average about 3 cm. The steep thermal gradient near the ground reported from ASI/Met temperature data was evaluated for its effect on the wind profile, but Richardson numbers had small magnitudes during the best wind profile periods so thermal effects did not influence measurement of z0 and u*. Discussion.  The particle diameter most easily moved by wind on Mars is predicted to be 100-160 µm, and the fluid threshold wind friction speed, u*t, to initiate motion of these particles is expected to be about 2 m/s[5,6].  Maximum wind friction speeds PATHFINDER IMP WINDSOCK RESULTS:  R. Sullivan et al. measured by the windsocks at the Pathfinder landing site are about half this value.  How much wind might be required to deflate a fineparticle mantle at the Pathfinder landing site, or to reactivate duneforms such as Jenkins and Mermaid seen by IMP or the barchan-like features seen by Sojourner? The answer must depend strongly on the size, cohesion, and availability of particles, but we can begin to address the overall question with knowledge of aerodynamic roughness.  Chepil and Woodruff[7], Lyles et al.[8] and many others have observed an increase in u*t with increasing non-erodible surface roughness and an expression for u*t with a modification of the bedform roughness term to include z0 has been proposed[9]. This relation is based on wind tunnel experiments with well-sorted particles and a maximum tested z0 of 3.4 mm, an order of magnitude less rough than the Pathfinder landing site, and needs further evaluation against controlled experiments at higher roughness, but for now we extrapolate using measured z0 to get a sense of the wind required to move potentially mobile materials through the landing site.  Wind profiles calculated using this relation with z0 = 3 cm indicate u*t = 3.1 m/s for 100 µm particles, and 4.4 m/s for 200 µm particles (profiles A and B in Fig. 1).  Initiation of saltation of the most easily moved particles would require wind speeds of about 28 m/s at the top windsock position (31 m/s at the Viking-equivalent height of 1.6 m), with speeds exceeding 45 m/s at heights above 10 m. These wind speeds are high enough to cause rock abrasion if durable saltating particles are available[10,11]. Ventifacts have been observed at the landing site[12], but the preservation of features consistent with ancient catastrophic flooding indicates long-term aeolian abrasion rates have been low[13,14].  It seems unlikely that strong, saltation-sustaining winds have been rare over the long exposure history of the site, and there is little evidence for preservation of features through burial and exhumation.  So durable particles capable of inflicting abrasion damage might have been in short supply for much of the history of the landing site.  Bridges et al.[12] proposed that a wide range of sand-sized debris could have been deposited subaqueously as part of one or more ancient flooding events, and later was exposed subaerially and became susceptible to winddriven saltation.  This period of effective abrasion was short-lived, however, as the supply of durable aeolian particles was depleted by attrition in energetic collisions with target rocks.  Accumulation of protective particle residues on target surfaces from the impacts of particle aggregates may also have been a factor, as has been proposed to reconcile the effectiveness of abrasion measured in environmental simulation experiments with the apparent long-term ineffectiveness of abrasion at the Viking Lander sites[11]. The duration of Pathfinder surface operations was much shorter than Viking Lander operations, and no wind-related changes to the Pathfinder site have been noticed in the IMP pictures so far (cf. [13,14,15]). This is consistent with IMP windsock u* measurements falling well below u*t for 100-160 µm particles, and indicates either: (1) during periods when the windsocks were not being imaged, winds continued to be light and below threshold-of-motion even for the most easily moved particles; or (2) if significantly stronger winds occurred during periods when the windsocks were not being imaged, u* never exceeded u*t for whatever size particles (if any) that might have been loose and available for movement.  Previous assumptions regarding z0 for Mars typically involved a range of values from 1 mm to 1 cm, which is less than the 3 cm value reported here for the Pathfinder site.  Nevertheless, this range of assumed values seems reasonable in context of the results reported here because the Pathfinder site is expected to be significantly rockier and rougher than most plains units on Mars [16,17].  Figure 1.  Wind profiles indicate aerodynamic roughness is 3 cm.  The sol 30 profile has a greater zero-wind intercept that reflects partial obstruction by lander components along azimuth 271.
