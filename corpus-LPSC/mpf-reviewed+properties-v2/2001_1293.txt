Introduction: The preliminary x-ray analysis of the Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) of the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) Mission is revised by a more accurate recalibration. A duplicate APXS was exposed to a simulated martian atmosphere and low temperatures and a consistent set of calibration curves for each element was obtained. Compared to the preliminary results the Fe concentration of all samples rose by about 25 %, while the Si concentration fell by about 10 %. A refined method for peak area evaluation permitted the determination of phosphorus in MPF soils and rocks in the x-ray spectra. The phosphorus data reveal the compatible behavior of P on Mars.  Evaluation of APXS x-ray spectra: During testing of the Pathfinder APXS at JPL a failure occurred in the electronic driver circuit for the motor, which actuates a shutter in front of the radioactive sources. As this failure remained - and remains - unexplained, the project decided to discard this circuit and fly the instrument with an open shutter. Consequently, the thin alumina/VYNX foil in front of the sources and its support grid were also removed, because without the shutter the foil would be exposed to a high radiation dose during the flight and probably break on landing. However, all calibrations were carried out with this foil - together with its support grid - in front of the alpha sources. This foil has been installed in order to prevent contamination of calibration samples with source material, emitted by a process known as 'recoil sputtering'. The support grid of this foil reduces the flux of alpha particles by about 15 %, whereas the attention of the flux of x rays from the source is almost negligible. This reduction of alpha and x-ray fluxes during calibration had been neglected in the preliminary analyses [1]. Originally, the x-ray spectra were fitted using Gaussian peak shapes, while now we used the exact peak shapes as obtained from standards. It permitted to precisely evaluate weak peaks that are interfered by large peaks. Careful new calibrations were performed with a MPF identical spare instrument under simulated  Table 1: Concentration of MPF samples in weight percentage, measured by APXS, based on recalibration, normalized to 100 %, and corrected.

Mars atmosphere and temperature conditions. Certified geostandards and other validated rocks and meteorites were used for the recalibration. As a result of all applied measures, the Si concentrations of the MPF samples fell by about 10 %, while the Fe concentrations rose by about 25 %. Considerable improvements were obtained in the determination of K and P. Results: Table 1 contains the data of the MPF soil and rock samples normalized to 100 %. The average error for each element is derived from the errors of peak areas and calibration curves. In spite of the considerable differences in Si, Fe and K compared to the preliminary analysis, the major observations of  [1] remain valid, i.e. the significant difference of soils and rocks in their chemical compositions. While the soils are compositionally similar to those at the Viking landing sites, the rocks with high Si and low Mg concentrations represent highly differentiated crustal material similar to what is found on Earth. These results are in contrast to the concept of a rather mafic martian surface that was inferred from Viking soil data and the composition of martian meteorites. As evident from the MPF IMP camera images, the surfaces of the rocks are covered to varying degrees with adhering dust, which was also confirmed by the APXS analysis. The mean soil shows a sulfur concentration of 2.72 weight %, while the S concentration of the MPF rocks range from 0.75 to 1.96 weight % and exceed by far the concentrations accommodated in magmas or igneous rocks. As shergottites (the most abundant type of martian meteorites) contain S between 0.13 to 0.32 %, we assume for the MPF rocks, which are more fractionated than the shergottites, a S concentration of 0.3 weight %. Hence, for the composition of the soilfree MPF rock extrapolation to 0.3 weight % S was applied for the regression of all measured elements versus S. As previously noticed [2], MPF rocks and soils have almost identical phosphorus concentrations in contrast to potassium, which is about a factor of two higher in the rocks than in the soils (Tables 1 and 2).  From SNC meteorites, it is known that P correlates with high Z rare earth elements (HREE) indicating its only moderately incompatible behavior on Mars in contrast to its behavior on Earth [3,4]. Comparing P with titanium, a refractory lithophile element of similar degree of compatibility as P, silicate fractionation processes can be characterized. Similar P/Ti ratios are found in shergottites and martian crustal rocks and soils (Table 2). Based on [5], we speculated that the solubility limit of apatite might be exceeded in silica rich martian magmas leading to MPF type rocks. A recent study by [6] on phosphate solubility in silicate melts makes this explanation unlikely.  The lower K/Th ratio of the soil compared to the SNCs may indicate mobility of phosphates in the martian surface. Phosphates contain most of the incompatible elements (U, Th, etc.) except K and are easily dissolved by slightly acidified brines [3].  Looking at Table 2, we also notice that the K/Cl ratio in MPF rocks is substantially lower than in shergottites. Hence, we suspect that the intrinsic Cl concentration of the MPF rocks are lower by about a factor of 3, but were raised due to uptake of Cl at the rock surfaces.  References: [1] Rieder R. et al.
