 ESTIMATING THE SILICA CONTENT OF MARTIAN LAVA FLOWS USING MOLA  B. J. Thomson 1 and J. W. Head III1, 1Brown University, Box 1846, Providence, RI 02906.  Bradley_Thomson@brown.edu Introduction Measurements made by the APXS (alpha-proton x-ray spectrometer) instrument during the Mars Pathfinder mission indicate that a number of rocks around the landing site have an anomalously high silica content [1].  These enigmatic rocks appear to have a composition similar to basaltic andesite, in contrast to the inferred basaltic bulk crustal composition of Mars [2].  On Earth, andesitic rocks are the second most common rock type after basalt and are commonly found on the continents near convergent margins [3].  They are believed to form primarily by fractional crystallization of basaltic magmas, although they can also result from such processes as magma mixing, crustal assimilation, and partial melting [4]. Recent work by Rutherford et al. [5] suggests that a basaltic andesite composition can be obtained by the addition of a few wt% H2O to a SNC inferred parent magma composition. The rheological properties of Martian lava flows have been estimated by a variety of techniques [e.g. 6-10].  Several studies have suggested the presence of more evolved (high silica) magmas in the Tharsis Montes and elsewhere [e.g. 6, 9, 11].  We investigated two lava flows around the southernmost Tharsis volcano, Arsia Mons (see Figure 1), using Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data to estimate the silica content based upon the apparent viscosities of the flows. Figure 1:  Regional view of Arsia Mons lava flow showing location of flows used in this study. Method The morphology of a lava flow is influenced by many parameters including the physical properties of the lava, temperature, extrusion rate, gravity, and local topography.  Treating a channelized lava flow as a laminar, isothermal Bingham plastic (a material that possesses a finite yield strength), there are three ways of estimating its yield strength remotely [7, 11]. Once its yield strength has been estimated, the apparent viscosity of a flow can be obtained by making some assumptions about the effusion rate.  The flow viscosity can then be correlated with SiO2 content.  The methods of estimating the yield strength of a flow are: Y = ρ g sinθ  H               (1) Y = ρ g (H2/Wf)               (2) Y = ρ g sin2θ  2wl (3) where Y is the yield strength, ρ is the bulk density, g is gravity, H is the flow thickness, Wf is the flow width, wl is the width of the levee of a channelized flow, and θ is the topographic gradient.  The yield strengths were calculated using density values of 2500 kg/m3 and 2900 kg/m3 (which represent a typical range of densities for basaltic flows [13]) and then averaged together. The flow viscosity (η) can be calculated by using the yield strengths from equations (1)-(3) and a reasonable estimation of the effusion rate, F [8]. r = wl / (Wf - wl)  (4) η = wl 3 Y  sin2θ  / 24 F            for r<1 (5) η = wl 2.75 Y1.25 sin1.5θ  / 24 F g0.25 ρ0.25    for r≥1 (6) Effusion rates can be estimated from the dimensionless Gratz number that is related to the cooling of a warm fluid moving through a cold pipe [8, 14] F = 300 κ wl L/H (7) where κ is the thermal diffusivity of the fluid and L is the total length of the flow.  In this analysis, κ is taken to be 7 × 10-7 m2/s for mafic lavas [8].  It should be noted that this method assumes that the levees are formed by lateral viscous flow, and thus it is not applicable to flows with levees formed by other means (i.e. overflow or accretion). Results The two lava flows that we analyzed (Figure 2) lie on the SW flank of Arsia Mons, about 250 km from the caldera.  A central channel is easily discernable on each flow.  The southernmost of the two flows  has been measured previously and was designated flow "A" by Moore et al. [7].  The morphologic parameters measured with MOLA are given in Table 1. For each flow, the profiles are listed in sequentially from west to east. Note that for the southern flow, the flow and the levee widths measured using MOLA are in good agreement with previously measured values.  However, the flow thickness and surface slope measured with MOLA are up to a factor of 2 greater than previous estimates.  As noted by Carr et al. [16], the thickness of a lava flow cannot easily be estimated from photographs.  This thickness discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the heights we have reported are measured as the perpendicular from the baseline of the flow to its highest point, a technique that is difficult at best with shadow measurements or photoclinometry. The surface slope values given in Table 1 indicate that the southern flow was emplaced upon a slope that gradually shallows with increasing distance from the caldera.  The slope measurement given in [7] may have been taken from the distal end of the flow where the surface slope decreases.  Some of SiO2 WT% OF MARTIAN LAVAS:  B. J. Thomson and J. W. Head III the difference in slope values may also be due to different baselines of measurement between MOLA and pre-MOLA [17] topography. Discussion The viscosities tabulated below should be considered upper limits since the inferred effusion rates are lower limits. The calculated viscosities using MOLA data range from 42.3×Pa.s to 6.28×105 Pa.s.  The mean viscosities of the northern and southern flows are 2.68×105 Pa.s and 9.04×103 Pa.s, respectively.  The southern flow has a viscosity similar to laboratory and field measurements of the viscosities of terrestrial basalts, which typically range from 102 to 104 Pa.s. The viscosity of the northern flow, though larger, is still much less than measured viscosities for dacite and or rhyolite (1010 to 1011 Pa.s) [18].  The values calculated for this flow based upon photoclinometry seem unusually low, and are likely due to the aforementioned underestimation of θ and H. Based on a small sample of field measurements from Mauna Loa and Paricutin, [12] presented a method of obtaining a rough estimate of the silica content of a flow based only on its inferred viscosity logη = 0.266p  - 8.06   (8) where p is the percentage silica content.  Applying this relationship to the viscosity values given in Table 2 yields the estimated silica contents also given in Table 2. The mean silica content of the northern lava flow as measured by MOLA is 50 wt% SiO2, with a standard deviation of 2 wt%.  This value is within one standard deviation of the cutoff value of 52 wt% SiO2 for a basaltic andesite composition [2]. The southern flow has a mean silica content of 45 wt% SiO2 (s.d. = 2 wt% SiO2), which lies in the basalt range.  Consistent with the previously noted discrepancy in viscosity, the inferred SiO2 wt% contents based on the data from [7] are ~10 wt% less than the value obtained using MOLA data.  Again, underestimation of H and θ are probably the cause.  These results indicate that some lava flows may posses more evolved compositions approaching those seen at the Pathfinder landing site. As the search for high-silica rocks continues, we believe that the tools used in this analysis hold promise for a better understanding of lava flow emplacement and evolution.
