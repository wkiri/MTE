Synopsis. Dust devils have long been suspected on Mars [1, 2]. First observed on Viking Orbiter images [3], numerous active dust devils were observed from Mars Pathfinder, both from lander images [4, 5, 6] and inferred from meteorology data [7], and from Mars Global Surveyor [8]. Dust devils are effective in raising very fine particles into the atmosphere under wind conditions which would otherwise be too benign for threshold; once lifted from the surface by the vortex motion, dust is easily carried aloft in suspension. Previous experiments suggested that part of the efficiency of dust devils in particle entrainment results from low atmospheric pressures within the vortex core, enabling a type of "lift" function [9]. To explore the threshold and flux of particles by dust devils, an apparatus has been fabricated for running experiments under both one atmposhere ("Earth") and low pressure ("Mars") conditions. Background. Dust devils observed at the Mars Pathfinder landing site and from Mars Global Surveyor (Fig. 1) suggest that they might be common on Mars, prompting study of how they might form. The studies include numerical modeling [10, 11] and terrestrial analogs [12]. Dust devils are efficient in raising particles into the atmosphere by winds  which  otherwise are  too gentle  for threshold. Figure 1. Top of an active Martian dust devil (bright spot in upper left) imaged by MOC (frame M01-4498) in the southern highlands at Ls=145.5; its shadow indicates a height of ~ 556 m (courtesy R. Kuzmin). Although the most visible part of a dust devil is the column of dust (i.e., particles <~ 20 microns in diameter) raised by the vortex, larger particles are also set into  motion and carried to heights of 100s of meters [13]. Dust devils are vortices which form beneath atmospheric convective plumes. They create a zone of low pressure within their cores, although a small zone of slightly high pressure can form in the central part of the core (Fig. 2) which results from a sinking air mass. Although there is an increased surface shear stress caused by the rotating air mass which contributes to particle threshold, previous considerations [9] suggested that it is the low pressure and the pressure gradient through the vortex that provides the primary 'lift' to mobilize particles. To complement these studies, we have fabricated an apparatus to simulate dust devils in the laboratory. Figure 2. Circulation in a dust devil showing upward vortex motion, general winds moving toward the right at altitude, and a sinking air mass in the middle of the vortex (black arrows) (From Cooke et al.[14] after Idso [15]). Laboratory apparatus.  The Mars Dust Devil Device (MDDD) consists of three components, the frame, the vortex generator, and the test table (Fig. 3). The entire apparatus can be dismantled for transport into the field for conducting experiments on natural surfaces and for use in a low-pressure  chamber at Ames Research Center for tests under Martian atmospheric conditions. The vortex generator includes a cylinder 45 cm in diameter, a "bell mouth" to alleviate boundary effects at the edge of the cylinder, a motor drive, and a fan blade system. The generator is mounted to the frame so that it can be lowered or raised above the test table, enabling the geometry of the simulated dust devil to be varied. The table is 3 by 3 m. It is mounted independent of the frame which holds the vortex generator so that potential motor vibrations are isolated from the test bed. The table can be raised or lowered, moved laterally to simulate motion of a dust devil across terrain features, and tilted to simulate a vortex that is not perpendicular to the surface. Figure 3. The Mars Dust Devil Device showing part of the frame, the vortex generator cylinder, and the test-table; a simulated dust-devil is visible as the white cloud rising from the test-table. MDDD is instrumented to measure the ambient temperature and relative humidity, and wind speeds and surface pressures on the test bed beneath the dust devil. Pressures are measured continuously from 14 stations (flush-mounted pressure transducers manufactured by Setra), which can be placed in a variety of configurations. All data are processed by Labview software. Calibrations are currently being made and results compared with field measurements of natural dust devils. Figure 4 is a profile through a vortex generated in MDDD, showing the lowpressure zone of the vortex; note also the slight rise in pressure at the center of the vortex, inferred to correspond to the central rise in pressure seen in some natural dust devils. Approximately 500 runs for pressure structure have been made as calibrations, with results that are consistent with field studies, giving confidence in the laboratory simulations. Figure 4.

Planned experiments.  Two general types of experiments will be conducted, threshold and terrain modeling. The threshold runs will be made to determine the conditions under which particles are lifted above the surface as a function of particle size and dust-devil parameters, including pressure gradient and surface shear stress, as related to rotational speed. These tests will be complemented with runs to assess the flux of dust and other particles. Test will be run at one atmosphere conditions ("Earth") and then under low atmospheric pressure ("Mars") in the NASA-Ames Research Center Mars Surface Wind Tunnel facility. The second type of experiments will include model runs using craters, scarps and other landforms to assess the topographic effects on dust devil geometry and particle-lifting properties.
