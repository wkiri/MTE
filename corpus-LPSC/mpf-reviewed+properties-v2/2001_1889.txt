(kuebler@levee.wustl.edu) Introduction: A major goal of the Mars Microbeam Raman Spectrometer (MMRS) [1] is to characterize rock and soil mineralogies. Will it be able to determine the mineralogy of the fine-grained soils? The study here is a preliminary test of the ability of Raman spectroscopy to identify minerals as very fine grains. The existence of a fine-grained, global soil on Mars was shown by the Viking and Pathfinder missions [2,3]. The soil is rich in sulfur, with 4-8% S as equivalent SO3 [4-6] and perhaps as much as 10-15% in some locations on the basis of spectroscopic observation [4,7]. Sulfur is presumably in the form of sulfate [2-7]. Like sulfate, carbonate is present as secondary phases in SNC meteorites [8,9] and is presumably present on Mars, but spectroscopic evidence is lacking [refs. in 2,4; below 5% (TES), 10]. Both carbonates and sulfates are strong Raman scatterers and readily identified and characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra of some common varieties are shown in Figure 1. The mean grain size of the wind-blown soil is estimated to be 1.6 µm [11-14]. We have analyzed calcite, epsomite, quartz, and olivine crushed from larger crystals and fine-grained epsomite (MgSO4·7H2O) grown in the laboratory to determine how well our Raman spectrometer can detect such fine-grained materials. We also tested a simplified fine-grained quartz and sulfate "duricrust." Samples and Methods: Samples were analyzed with a HoloLab 5000 (Kaiser Optical System, Inc.) Raman Spectrometer whose optical configuration is similar to that of the MMRS. We use the 532nm line of a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser for excitation. The bulk "duricrust" samples were analyzed using a 20× long working distance objective. Calcite and olivine samples were crushed from larger crystals in a mortar and epsomite crystals were crushed by pressing them against the surface of the laboratory bench. Calcite, olivine, and epsomite single grains (submicron to 20 µm) were placed on a glass microscope slide for examination. A 100× objective was used to analyze these individual crystals. Grain sizes were determined from calibrated 100× microscope images. Ten-second integration times were sufficient to acquire good spectra from the duricrust samples and the crushed epsomite, calcite and olivine grains larger than 4 µm. Longer accumulation times (up to 50s) were required for the smallest single grains, partly because a "background" of peaks from the underlying glass slide interfered in the spectra acquired from grains smaller than 4 µm. Two "duricrust" samples were made by evaporating aqueous solutions of MgSO4 onto a matrix of quartz grains (4-200 µm). The solutions, in petri dishes, were allowed to dry at room temperature over several weeks. Some 40 Raman spectra were acquired from the surface of each sample. Pieces of "duricrust" from each dish were spread onto a glass slide for epsomite grain-size determination and individual grain analysis. Results: No change in peak position (Raman shift) was observed for quartz, olivine, calcite, or epsomite to the limit of grain size examined (1 µm or slightly less) (but see [15,16]). No measurable peak broadening was observed for any grain down to 3 µm. Peak broadening may have been observed for grains smaller than 3 µm, but peak interference from the underlying glass plate precludes a conclusive result. Crushed calcite: We got strong Raman spectra from crystals smaller than 1.0 µm. Figure 2a is a spectrum from a 0.6 × 0.8 µm grain. No shift in peak position or appreciable broadening (≤2 cm-1) of the 156 cm-1, the 282 cm-1, or the 1087 cm-1 peak was observed with decreasing grain size. Crushed epsomite: We got strong spectra from crystals smaller than 3.5-4.0 µm. Figure 2b is a 50s spectrum from a 2.3 x 4.5 µm sized grain. We can detect grains as small as 1-2 µm, but the main sulfate peak is present as a shoulder on the broad ~1096 cm-1 peak from the glass of the slide. Although the peak is visible in the raw spectra, a baseline subtraction was needed to confirm the Raman shift (984 cm-1) of the epsomite peak because of interference from the nearby 990 cm-1 weak feature of the glass (Fig. 2c). Curve fitting was also used to resolve epsomite peak positions. No shift in peak position was observed with decrease in grain size. No appreciable broadening of the 984 cm-1 peak (~1 cm-1) was observed as grain size decreased from 20 µm to ~3.5 µm, but results for smaller grains are inconclusive because of the interference from the slide. Duricrust samples 1 and 2, analyzed as crystallized in the petri dishes: We got good peaks from both the sulfate and quartz in every spectrum (80 total) acquired from the dried "duricrust" samples. Figure 2d is a typical spectrum from the duricrust. Lines from epsomite consistently dominate the spectra in both samples because the epsomite coats the grains of quartz, and the intensity of the epsomite peak relative to the quartz peak is greater in sample 2 (higher proportion of epsomite) than in sample 1. Samples 1 and 2, spread across a microscope slide: Quartz is the dominant phase in the spectra from the smeared material of sample 1. The epsomite coatings were dislodged by the spreading across the slide. Epsomite is present in 6 of 10 spectra, but is weak and on average is from finer grains than the quartz. Strong quartz spectra are acquired from grains larger than 4µm, and weaker spectra from grains as small as 2.6 µm. No shift in peak position was detected for any of   Can we detect carbonate and sulfate minerals on the surface of Mars? K. Kuebler et al. the quartz or epsomite peaks from curve fitting results and no evidence of peak broadening was found in grains down to the smallest examined, ~3 µm. Smaller grains were analyzed from sample 2. Epsomite was present in six of the eight grains analyzed and quartz was present in two. Figure 2c is a spectrum from a 1.3 x 2.6 µm grain taken from sample 2. Again, no shift in peak position was detected from curve fitting of the glass and epsomite peaks and no evidence of peak broadening (≤2 cm-1) was observed down to a grain size of ~2 µm. Discussion: Raman spectra of small (1 to a few µm) crystals of calcite, epsomite, olivine, and quartz showed no change in peak position (Raman shift) and no peak broadening down to at least 3 µm. The Mars Microbeam Raman Spectrometer should be able to identify sulfate and carbonate minerals in the Martian dust if they occur. References: [1] Haskin et al.
