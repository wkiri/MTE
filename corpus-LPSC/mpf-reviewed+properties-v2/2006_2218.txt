(ccipp@irsps.unich.it) Introduction: Mars surface bears traces of many fluvial-like features, geomorphic identified as outflow channels, valley networks etc. Among these a particular one stands above others from the dimensional point of view. Outflow channels bear unique water erosion characteristics, that led Baker and Milton (1974) [1] to believe that are caused by a surface runoff of large amounts of water, in short geological time. Water origin, necessary for these processes was the topic of many works. Among these theories one generally accepted idea considers that water is originating from melting of permafrost layers positioned in the places of today chaos'. Here is an investigation that takes into account the exoergic salt-ice dissolution reaction, along with freezing point depression of formed salty solutions, as a complentary or a stand-alone process in chaosoutflow channel formation mechanism. This model is trying to best fit the observation of Iani Chaos - Ares Vallis - Chryse Planitia system. Water source: Currently there are three more or less widely accepted ideas concerning the formation of outflow channels and the origin of water necessary for outflow "carving": 1. Massive release of subsurface confined aquifer; first proposed by Carr [2]. Release of the aquifer water involves some catastrophic event (e.g. meteorite impact, faulting etc.) in such a manner that the groundwater should be released at surface through permafrost layer. 2. Dehydration of hydrates evaporites, having as caloric energy source volcanic activity of Tharsis [3]; evaporitic minerals present in source places for outflow channels, such as gypsum, epsomite, kieserite in the presence of a geothermal gradient would release the structural water at critical points specific for every mineral, hence all the water is structural water, implying huge amounts of evaporitic deposits being prior deposited. 3. Melting of permafrost ground ice. There are many morphologic evidences that the Martian soil bears large amounts of water trapped in ice form (permafrost). Ogawa et al. [4] pointed out that permafrost melting could be powered by the heat released from associated magmatic intrusions, that raise the thermal gradient around specific places, most of them being connected to Tharsis volcanic activity.   Salt occurrences: Early evidences about the presence of sulfates on Mars dates back to Viking landers in 1976 [5]. X-ray fluorescence data collected, led to recognition of Mg-S, and latter to the concept that MgSO4 class salts, could be the cementing agent in Martian soils at two widely separated landing places (Chryse Planitia and Utopia Planitia). The Viking 1 landing site (Chryse Planitia) is the place where Ares outflow channel is depositing its transporting materials. The following Martian landers Pathfinder [6] and MER A Spirit [7], and MER B Opportunity [8] also revealed high soluble salts contents in places possibly genetically connected. Recently OMEGA aboard Mars Express spacecraft has proven the existence of gypsum and other highly soluble salts (e.g kieserite and epsomite) in localized deposits in places around Valles Marineris, and Iani Chaos [9]. Freezing point depression of water solutions: The freezing point of pure water at 1 bar is 0°C (273K). This melting point can be easily depressed by adding impurities or soluble salts to the solvent. In the case of halite (NaCl) salt it is known that a 10% NaCl solution lowers the melting point of about -6°C (267K) and a 20% salt solution lowers it to -16°C (257K). A solution typically has a measurably lower melting point than the pure solvent, this usually being called freezing point depression. The freezing point depression ∆Tf is a colligative property of the solution, and for dilute solutions is found to be proportional to the molal concentration: ∆Tf =Kfcm                                                                               - Kf is the freezing-point-depression constant - cm molal concentration of the solution. Table 1 lists a number of common salt minerals and their corresponding freezing point depression temperature. All of these minerals could be easily inferred to exist after a normative computation of analyses on soils in Chryse Planitia from Viking 1 and Pathfinder data sets.

Iani Chaos - Ares Vallis - Chryse Planitia system. Iani Chaos is thought to be part of the originating water source for Ares Vallis (Fig2a). The bright-layered deposits in Iani Chaos were recently proven to bear the gypsum near infrared (NIR) spectral signature [9]. The layering of these deposits led to idea that they were precipitated from a large standing body of water, possibly due to water evaporation in a warmer climate. One could expect to have an evaporitic deposition in area covered today by Iani Chaos, which would  resemble a normal precipitation sequence, beginning with less soluble salts at the base. Normally, above less soluble salts as gypsum, a sequence of highly soluble salts such as Na and/or K chlorides (e.g. halite, sylvite), and hydrated Mg sulfates (e.g. kieserite, epsomite), ending with some very high soluble salts such as Mg, K sulfates and chlorides, is expected to be precipitated from Martian marine solution. There is no strong evidence for the existence of large highly soluble salts deposits in Iani Chaos; instead these have been indirectly proven to exist diseminated in Chryse Planitia soil by the instruments on board Viking 1 lander and Pathfinder rover. Permafrost salt melting: After precipitation, the evaporitic minerals were covered, in arid environment, by a highly weathered mineral layer, that is the Martian soil, consisting mainly of products of chemical alteration in water presence, of pristine mafic and ultramafic rocks, which depending on geological age and settings could have thickness starting from a few meters to thousands of meters of overburden. This is expected to have high porosity and could easily trap water in its porosity space, and following the climatic changes could freeze easily forming the permafrost. In the case of Iani Chaos the permafrost overburden can reach a thickness of about ~1100 m (the depth is measured from the overburden surface to gypsum bearing strata) from MOLA topography. It is difficult to estimate at this point the depth of the original gypsum deposition. After the overburden release, the isostatic equilibrium of the system was disturbed, forcing the remaining strata to reach a new equilibrium state to compensate the overburden loss. Thus the gypsumbearing outcrop has risen on a scale of hundreds of meters, presenting an estimated MOLA structural dip of about 25-30° (fig 2b). Fig. 1 Presumed stratigraphy stack of pre-chaos area. The salty solutions percolate upward melting progressively the permafrost. Considering this very likely scenario in the prechaos stratigraphic sequence, we may have had a metastable interface of highly soluble salts, underlying a permafrost overburden (fig1). This labile equilibrium was very easily disturbed, and eventually cancelled, as more and more saline solution percolated upward the permafrost, melting more ice, until a critical point was reached. This critical point was the bursting that produced the Ares Vallis outflow channel. Conclusions: Salt geochemistry could explain some critical issues regarding Mars processes and topography. Salt-ice reaction can be an efficient "thermal engine" that will melt the permafrost and prevent the refreezing in current climate conditions at Mars surface. Further investigation may establish the importance of this proposed process, with respect to the other processes proposed so far in literature.
