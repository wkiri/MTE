 USING MARS'S SULFUR CYCLE TO CONSTRAIN THE DURATION AND TIMING OF FLUVIAL PROCESSES.  D. L. Blaney, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Dr., MS 183-501, Pasadena, CA 91109, email:  Diana.L.Blaney@jpl.nasa.gov  The Problem:  Recent discoveries on of extensive small scale layering [e.g. 1], possible oceans and shorelines [e.g. 2,3,4] and surface mineralogy [e.g. 5, 6] present a contradictory picture of how the surface of Mars evolved.  On one hand, there is clear evidence for the important role water has had shaping the geomorphology of the Martian surface.  On the other hand, the geochemical signature of extended liquid water - rock interactions has not been detected (except for possibly the Hematite regions).  Reconciling these data is critical to understanding the biological potential of Mars and to develop an effective approach to search for evidence of life on Mars.  Unlike carbonates which have not been detected on Mars and may be destroyed on the optical surface [e.g. 7, 8], sulfur is know to exist in large abundances [9,10] at diverse locations. The sulfur content of Martian bright soils at the Viking I, II, and Pathfinder sites is higher than the sulfur content of basaltic rocks that provide the original starting material for Martian soils.  Thus the sulfur (and other salts) must be incorporated into the soils by chemical processes.  The processes that have lead to the incorporation of sulfur into the Martian soils is therefore the related to the dominant the chemical systems on Mars.  What do we know about Martian sulfates? Our knowledge of the Martian sulfur cycle comes primarily from four sources of information: in situ measurement of soil chemistry at the Viking and Pathfinder landing sites, ground-based and spacecraft infrared observations of sulfate absorption features, laboratory analysis of sulfates in Martian meteorites, and studies of the Martian thermal inertia and albedo.   Sulfur at the Viking and Pathfinder sites:  Elemental analysis using the Viking I and II X-Ray Fluoresce (XRF) instrument [9] and the Pathfinder Alpha Proton X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) with the original calibration [10] showed that the dust was elementally similar (if sulfur is excluded) at 3 widely separated locations.  Sulfur at the Viking sites was concentrated in clods.  No correlation of a major cation with sulfur was identified. Measurements of the rocks at the Pathfinder site indicated that the soils are not elementally similar to the local rocks due to differences in magnesium and iron. This implied that the Pathfinder soils are not derived primarily from local materials [e.g. 10,11,12,13]. Thermal Inertia and Albedo:  Thermal inertia and albedo data from the Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) was used to identify possible regions of a sulfate cemented soils [e.g.14, 15, 16].   Mellon et al. (2000) [17] have produced a thermal inertia map using MGS TES data.  Their analysis of the MGS TES thermal inertia and albedo data identified four surface units (A, B, C, and D).  They argue that Unit C is a soil similar to the high albedo soils in Unit A cemented by a sulfate duracrust.  Cementation acts to darken the soil and increase the thermal inertia.  A distribution of Unit C similar to those regions proposed previously as regions of duracrust based on IRTM data was found.  Both the Viking I and II landing site (where duracrust have actually been observed) are located on unit C strengthening this argument. Looking at data in the region of Pathfinder, they found that the thermal inertia was consistent with cemented soils, although the albedo was higher than defined for Unit C.   Infrared observations of sulfates:  Mars has been studied intensely in the infrared by ground-based observers and spacecraft instruments.  The rise out of the 4.2 µm - 4.4 µm CO2 band and that an absorption feature must be added at roughly 4.5 µm at the 2ν3 overtone of the SO4 -2 anion. An exact match to a terrestrial sulfate mineral was not made but it was suggested that the mineral has very weak structure and thus a high degree of symmetry [18].   More recent work with improved atmospheric modeling of the spectra showed that the variability seen in these spectra (at ~500 km spatial resolution) was not solely due to differences in dust opacity in the atmosphere or surface temperature effects but are related to variable sulfate concentrations on the Martian surface [19]. Mapping of sulfates on the Martian surface with Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) has proven difficult due to the overlap of sulfate features with those caused by silicates and by dust in the Martian atmosphere and on the surface [e.g.5].  Recent work suggested that  very weak features (~1-3% deep) at 8.8 µm might be due to cemented Mg sulfate [20].  This feature mapped in regions consistent with previously proposed regions of sulfate duracrust based on thermal inertia and cover large regions of the planet.    Where Did the Sulfur Come From?  Two types of processes have been proposed for the incorporation of sulfates into Martian soils: aqueous and atmospheric.  To date we are limited in our analysis—we've only got data on sulfate from the same type of location—i.e. areas where there are sulfate cemented soils.  Knowledge of sulfates in other types of locations is required to distinguish between these alternatives. Aqueous:  Sulfates are highly soluble in water.  On the earth, most sulfate deposits are the results  Martian Sulfur:  D. L. Blaney  of evaporate deposits [e.g. 21]. Martian meteorites contain calcium sulfates believed to originate from Martian ground water [e.g. 22] implying that martian groundwater is sulfate rich.  Thus a fluvial origin of Martian sulfates may be possible [e.g. 23,24,25].   Sulfate rich waters may be derived locally and be associated with specific fluvial events.    Prediction:  If related to local fluvial events, sulfur concentration should be associated with local geology and vary from location to location.  The specific chemistry and mineralogy should be variable with location. Salt concentration would be a result of the source water chemistry and the openness of the fluvial system.   Soils in locations with separate aquifers should have different concentrations and ratios.   Therefore, the global distribution of sulfur measured by Odysseys should show relationships between sources of water.  MER should find that there are differences in the sulfur concentration (and perhaps overall salt chemistry) vary at different locations.   Volcanic Aerosols:  Volcanic eruptions frequently contain sulfur dioxide, potassium, and chlorine in addition to water and carbon dioxide [e.g. 26].  Modeling of atmospheric chemistry of Martian eruptions suggests that the sulfur dioxide form a sulfuric acid aerosol that then settles out of the atmosphere [e.g. 27].  Recent work on sulfur isotopic signatures in Martian meteorites has been used to suggest that sulfur may have originated in the atmospheric before incorporation and mobilization into the subsurface [28].   The abundance of sulfur at three landing sites (Chryse, Utopia, Ares Valley), the lack of a correlation of cation with the elemental pattern, and a weak crystalline structure at these sites point toward the sulfates forming from volcanic aerosols [e.g. 18, 27, 29, 30, 31,32].  Predictions:   If true, sulfur abundance might be correlated with expected global circulation of SO2 aerosols.  Perhaps H20 and SO2 snowed out of volcano might give areas near volcanic regions a higher sulfur concentration.  Salts deposits may be localized to specific volcanoes.  Odyssey mapping of sulfur should also be present in locations with no evidence for fluvial processes or not in association with bright soils.  Sulfur would continue to display no correlation with cation.   Discussion:  Distinguishing between an aqueous and volcanic origin for sulfates on Mars would provide an enormous step forward in understanding the duration and timing of geologic fluvial processes.   Duration:  Given the abundance of sulfur in the martian surface and it's inherent solubility, if sulfates of clearly aqueous origin cannot be found it would imply that fluvial activity on Mars was very short lived.  Even if the water did not have sufficient time to react with the local host rock to form clays, dissolved sulfate should be in the source ground water.  This sulfate should form evaporite deposits as lakes dried up or the proposed northern hemisphere ocean retreated.  A lack of sulfate deposits would imply that the water froze so rapidly after release that the sulfate was either trapped in the solid or only had time to precipitate out at the bottom of the ice wedge.  Timing:  The solubility of sulfate in water could be used to determine the relative timing of different geologic events.  For instance, if a volcanic aerosol origin was determined for the sulfates at the Pathfinder Ares Valles site, then the volcanism associated with the current sulfates on the Martian surface would need to occur AFTER the flooding or the sulfate would have been dissolved.  If the sulfate is associated with specific aqueous events (for instance aquifer A has higher sulfur content than aquifer B) that feed a common source region, it may be possible by to determine the relative timing of the events by looking at chemical gradients in the catch basin.
