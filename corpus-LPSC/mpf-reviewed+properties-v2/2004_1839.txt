Introduction:  Here we outline a simple chemical proxy for the action of past water on the Martian surface that can be measured by MER APXS. Sorption of P by iron oxyhydroxides in aqueous solution is a well-known property of these materials, and we use this important process, and its chemical signature, as an indicator of water on the Martian surface.  Our basic approach is to 1) identify chemical indicators for the sorption of P by iron oxyhydroxides that are measurable by APXS, and 2) determine how materials such as specular hematite, palagonite, and basalt may be affected by the process of P sorption under putative Martian conditions. Results on specular hematite and palagonite (JSC Mars-1 simulant) are presented separately in [1]. P/Fe in the Solar System:  Fig. 1 shows P vs. Fe (wt.%) for a variety of solar system materials, such as the Moon, Mars, Vesta/Eucrites, as well as a variety of terrestrial materials.  Terrestrial materials, with the exception of extremely iron-rich materials (such as oxisols and BIF's), have lower bulk Fe contents than Martian meteorites or MPF.  The majority of terrestrial materials have P<0.06 and Fe<11 (wt.%); this part of Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 2.  It can be seen that East Pacific Rise (EPR) sediments lie at higher P/Fe than most other materials. Fig. 3a. shows the P/Fe (wt.%) of materials in Fig. 1.  With the exception of five analyses, all materials have P/Fe <0.05.  Two of the five are Martian.  On Fig. 3b. the P/Fe (wt.%) of EPR seds are shown.  The majority of these materials have P/Fe >0.05.  Thus, P/Fe may be a useful discriminant for materials that form in a manner similar to the EPR seds. East Pacific Rise sediments and poorly crystalline iron oxyhydroxide formation on Earth. EPR seds are iron oxyhydroxide-dominated and have been shown to be excellent sorbers of P [2] and have been postulated to be major terrestrial sinks for P; the process of PO4 removal from emanating vent fluids at mid-ocean ridges could be responsible for 100% removal of P from the water column [3].  The process for the formation of EPR seds is by the oxidation of Fe2+ in the vent solution to Fe3+ upon contact of the reducing vent fluid with the oxidizing ocean.  Fe3+ is insoluble and then precipitates out as poorly crystalline iron oxyhydroxide minerals.  This is a process that is expected to occur whenever reduced iron in solution becomes oxidized, and can be found to occur in lakes, rivers, water-lain sediments, and soils [4-6].  This process should occur at lower rates on Mars, due to the expected lack of a biosphere. P/Fe as an aquamarker for Sinus Meridiani: The coarse-grained, gray, crystalline hematite identified by TES [7] is likely formed by the reduced iron in solution becoming oxidized and precipitating poorly-crystalline iron oxyhydroxides.  The maturation of these particles to coarse-grained hematite can occur by various pathways [8].  In our companion study [1], we have studied the P sorption properites of coarse-grained hematite (specularite), and found that it is a poor sorber; P-rich fluids that may have been present after specularite formation would not lead to enhanced P/Fe of this phase.  But, the precursors of gray hematite on Mars likely had high P with respect to martian igneous rocks. Specularites that we studied had low contents of occluded P [1], suggesting that some P may have been lost, possibly by bacterial utilization of this important bioelement.  PO4 associated with EPR seds has been shown to be utilized by microbes [9].  On Mars, if the Sinus Meridiani region hematite deposits were not formed in an active biosphere, the high P expected in Martian fluids (Mars has 10x higher P than Earth [10], and fluids are expected to be high in P [11]) would have led to high P/Fe precursor iron oxides.  The P would either become occluded in Martian specularite (leading to higher P/Fe) or the PO4 would be precipitated locally due to low solubility of PO4 in fluids.  The exception might be low pH fluids, wherein phosphate mineral solubility increases in an Arrhenian fashion with decreasing pH.  Thus, we expect the Sinus Meridiani hematite to have either 1) high P/Fe due to occluded P, or 2) spatially associated phosphate mineralization if fluids were not too acidic. P/Fe as an aquamarker for Gusev Crater: Poorly crystalline iron oxyhydroxides are expected in any environment in which reducing ironbearing fluids become oxidized.  Lakes on Earth (or Mars) are no exception.  We predict that if the MER rovers find concentrations of poorly crystalline iron oxide/hydroxide minerals, that these deposits will have high P if they formed in an aqueous environment.
