Introduction: As part of a systematic search for surface changes in wide angle MGS MOC images, we have begun a global survey of the occurrence of Martian dust devils. Observations of the frequency, location, and seasonal variations in dust devil activity should provide valuable insights into Martian meteorology and surface geology.  Background: The planet-wide spread of dust by winds is one of the major geologic processes on Mars. However, current surface wind speeds may insufficient to transport fine dust particles into the atmosphere. First discovered by Viking Orbiter [1], dust devils have been a frequent topic of study for researchers interested in their role in initiating local and global dust storms and determining the dust content of the Martian atmosphere. Several studies have contributed to our understanding of dust devils on Mars: laboratory simulations [2,3], mathematical models [e.g. 4,5], studies of terrestrial dust devils [6,7] and remote sensing are among the tools being used to investigate the properties and dynamics of Martian dust devils. Observed first in Acidalia Planitia [1] and elsewhere [8] from Viking Orbiter and later by Mars Pathfinder [9] and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) [10,11], dust devils are identified in images as small bright clouds with long, tapered shadows. Almost 100 dust devils had been sighted by Thomas and Gierasch [1] in Acidalia Planitia in Viking Orbiter images (Ls = 122º to 124º). However, poor resolution of Viking images may have limited identification of smaller dust devils that may be more frequent [8]. In addition to their importance to the Martian atmosphere, dust devils can yield important clues to the character of the Martian surface. Recent studies [10] revealed surface changes caused by the passage of dust devils across the planet's surface, emphasizing the importance of these bright and dark streaks on albedo changes on Mars' surface. The presence of dust devils in some areas but not in others also provides a direct indication of whether or not the surface is coated by dust.    Dust Devil Sightings: We have begun a global survey of the occurrence of Martian dust devils as part of a systematic search for surface changes in Wide Angle Camera (WAC) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images [Geissler et al., this meeting]. WAC images provide much more frequent coverage than the higher resolution NAC images, and are thus better suited to gathering statistics on transient atmospheric phenomena. The resolution of the WAC images (240 m/pixel) permits detection of much smaller dust devils than could be seen in the Viking data. We are still in the initial stages of our survey and have so far examined only a narrow strip covering 5 degrees of latitude and 55 degrees of longitude. Several red-filter WAC images that we have studied have captured active dust devils. All of our sightings so far were on Sinai Planum at an elevation of approximately 4 km. All occurred during Southern Hemisphere mid-winter at Ls between 140 and 150 degrees. We can determine their heights from the lengths of  their shadows. Heights of those detected thus far vary from 0.4 to 2.6 km. The dust devil in Figure 1 is about 1.75 km in diameter and 2.6 km high. In contrast, the height of dust columns in terrestrial dust devils rarely exceeds 1 km [5]. Many Martian dust devils appear in clusters. Figure 2 shows a concentration of three dust devils spanning 10 km and a large dust plume just southeast of the cluster. Figure 3 shows six dust devils within an area only 70 km across. Discussion: If Martian dust devils are responsible for the generation of dust storms, they have a profound influence on climatic variations on Mars. Global dust storms alter atmospheric thermal structure and circulation dynamics on the planet [9]. Future study of MOC images will allow us to determine the frequency of their formation, the time at which they generally occur, and the regions in which they tend to form. This will be an important tool in determining to what degree dust devils are capable of injecting dust particles into the Martian atmosphere and the geological composition of areas on Mars. Detections of dust devils and observation of large areas over time will help us discover how the occurrence of dust devils affects surface changes on Mars.
