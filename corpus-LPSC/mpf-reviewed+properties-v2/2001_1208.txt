Introduction: A poorly crystalline, ferric ironbearing material is assumed to be widely present on the surface of Mars, comprising a significant fraction of the fine-grained dust [1,2]. This material appears to be most prevalent in the bright regions [2]. Palagonite, a poorly crystalline weathering product of basaltic tuffs [3] is spectrally similar (below ~1 µm) to Martian bright region spectra. We have examined the spectral reflectance properties of a number of palagonites which exhibit spectral similarities to Martin bright region and Pathfinder soil spectra both before and after heating to determine the spectrum-altering effects of heating. Experimental Procedure:. Two palagonite samples were included in this study. PAL101 was obtained from Dr. Richard Morris (his sample #HWMK600) [4]. PAL102 was obtained from Dr. Ted Roush (his sample #91-16) [5]. Compositions are provided in Table 1. Reflectance spectra of the samples were measured at the NASA RELAB spectrometer facility at Brown University as follows: 0.3-2.6 µm spectra were measured at i=30( and e=0(, with 5 nm spectral resolution relative to halon; 2.5-26 µm were measured at i=30( and e=30(, with 4 cm-1 spectral resolution relative to brushed gold. The spectra were merged in the 2.5-2.6 µm region [6]. The palagonite samples used for the spectral measurements were dry sieved, without crushing, from the bulk samples to obtain <45 µm fractions. Splits of the <45 µm fractions were heated  in air to 160( and 600( C for 2 hours. The samples were weighed before and immediately after heating. After heating the samples were stored in air in sealed containers and the reflectance spectra of the heated samples were measured approximately 4 weeks after the heating events. Splits of the <45 µm fractions (both heated and unheated) were also characterized by X-ray diffraction. Results: Reflectance spectra of the heated and unheated palagonites are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The unheated samples are similar to another palagonite sample cited as a Martian spectral analog, JSC-1 [7]. The unheated sample spectra exhibit common spectral features, a steep absorption edge shortward of ~0.7 µm with some weak superimposed absorption features, generally flat spectral slopes between ~0.8 and 2.5 µm with absorption features in the 1.4 and 1.9 µm regions due to H2O/OH [8]. Beyond ~2.5 µm the spectra exhibit an intense O-H stretching fundamental near 2.8 µm. Heating of the samples resulted in weight losses. For heating to 160( C, weight losses were 9.6 wt. % for PAL101 and 6.7 wt. % for PAL102. For the 600( C heating events, weight losses were 16.4 wt. % for PAL101 and 14.8 wt. % for PAL102. The latter values exceed the loss on ignition values from the original investigators. In the case of PAL101, the original analytical data  are for the 5-53 µm fraction [4] and the PAL102 analysis is for the <2 mm fraction [5]. Loss on ignition was the weight loss after heating to 950°C for both PAL101 and PAL102 [4]. In the case of PAL102, the large difference in loss on ignition between the <2 mm fraction and <45 µm fraction suggests that a significant proportion of the water (or other volatiles) resides in the finer grain size material. X-ray diffractograms of the unheated and heated <45 µm size fractions of PAL101 and PAL102 show a number of broad peaks and the only mineral that could be identified with certainty in all cases was plagioclase feldspar. The X-ray diffractograms of the heated samples showed generally narrower diffraction peaks than the unheated sample diffractograms, and no significant new peaks appeared after heating. Spectrally, heating resulted in a number of changes. The reflectance spectra of the unheated, 160( and 600(C PAL101 samples are shown in Figure 1. Heating to 160(C produced only a slight increase in reflectance but no other significant spectral changes. The 1.4, 1.9, and 2.8 µm H2O/OH features persist and their intensities are not significantly reduced. The 600(C heating event produced more dramatic spectral changes. Overall reflectance increases significantly and an absorption band near 0.9 µm becomes more prominent. Once again the 1.4, 1.9, and 2.8 µm bands are evident. The results for the PAL102 sample are similar to those for PAL101 (Figure 2). Heating to 160(C produces few spectral changes beyond a very slight increase in reflectance. Heating to 600(C results in an increase in overall reflectance and shallower H2O/OH absorption bands. The 2.8 µm band also appears broader. Discussion: Heating of the palagonite results in decreases in the depths of the H2O/OH bands. Comparing the 1.4, 1.9, and 2.8 µm bands and the unheated and 600(C spectra, band depths decrease from 2.9 to 1.6%, 9.6 to 7.6%, and 73.0 to 61.5%, respectively for PAL101. Similar decreases are found for the PAL102 spectra. These spectral changes are similar to those found by Bruckenthal [9] who heated palagonite and Pahala ash to temperatures as high as 750(C. Even at these temperatures the H2O/OH bands were not completely removed. Whether this results from incomplete removal of H2O/OH from the sample or resorption of  PALAGONITE REFLECTANCE SPECTRA: E.A.

Bell et al. [10] measured reflectance spectra of a naturally thermally altered palagonite. They found that increasing thermal metamorphism reduced water content and led to increases in overall reflectance and decreases in the depths of the H2O/OH absorption bands (similar to the results found here). They also concluded that the most thermally altered palagonite is a better spectral analogue to Mars than the less thermally altered samples. Their most thermally altered sample is spectrally most similar to the 600°C heated samples. Conclusions: Thermal alteration of palagonites under terrestrial conditions (up to 750(C) causes a number of spectral changes and results in spectra which are more similar to Martian bright region spectra and naturally thermally altered terrestrial palagonites. Heating fails to completely remove H2O/OH absorption bands. We are also exploring the influence of low pressure and low temperature heating and dessication on these palagonite samples using an environment chamber that will simulate Mars surface conditions [11].
