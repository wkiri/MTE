 VESICLES IN SURFACE ROCKS: DETECTION, ANALYSIS AND SIGNIFICANCE; L. S. Crumpler, New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, Albuquerque, NM 87104; lcrumpler@nmmnh.state.nm.us  Introduction. Studies of vesicles in terrestrial lavas [1-20] indicate that the variables governing vesicle formation, redistribution, and growth within lavas are restricted and quantifiable. This points to their potential use in recording conditions of individual lava flows and establishing environmental conditions during eruptions. Vesicles will be among the most common macroscopic characteristics of volcanic surface rocks during planetary surface exploration. The ability to detect and interpret the significance of vesicles is a useful goal. Vesicle distributions in martian lavas are predicted to be distinct relative to terrestrial lavas. Measurements of vesicle distributions in surface rocks is a potential means of determining previously unknown quantities of interest such as initial vesicularity and gas content, atmospheric pressure, and characteristics of lava emplacement. Before this level of analysis can be achieved, ongoing work suggests that the conditions that control initial vesicularity must be resolved. Origin and Distribution of Vesicles. Basic observation and theory was discussed in [30]. The following is a brief review. Bubbles form in a silicate melt when it is supersaturated with respect to the principal magmatic volatiles (largely H2O, CO2, CO) [1; 2 ;3] on ascent and decompression from the source, and, isobarically, by crystallization of anhydrous minerals during initial solidification and crystal growth [4]. Within lava flows vesicles continue to grow through a combination of gas diffusion from the liquid to bubble nuclei and by physical coalescence of two or more bubbles. The downward size and density distribution in the upper half of most vertical sections defines a characteristic vesicularity profile. Vesicularity is defined as the total vesicle volume per unit volume of dense matrix. Observed profiles values agree well with vesicularity estimates based on the ideal gas law, PV=nRT [16]. Because the volume of gas at a given depth is conserved during coalescence, vesicularity profiles are not a function of vesicle coalescence. There are at least four models for vesicle distribution and growth in lava flows [10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16]: (1) static (2) inherited, (3) dynamic, and (4) inflated  A combined model 2 and 4 is currently supported. While the overall vesicularity remains largely unchanged, significant growth of vesicles takes place by coalescence of bubbles. Coalescence occurs during residence of bubbles at depths where solidification is delayed longest and vesicularity profiles are accordingly locked in during solidification. Vesicles in Surface Rocks. The pits in martian rocks include likely primary (vesicles) and secondary (weathering) origins [21; 22; 23; 24; 25]. Extensive fields of pitted rocks at Viking Lander 2 and the presence of extensive lava flows within Elysium are consistent with the interpretation that the majority of pits at this site are vesicles. Fluting and modification of original pits by wind has clearly occurred in rocks at the Pathfinder site [26, 27] as well as possible �sockets� where rounded pebbles have been removed from a sedimentary conglomerate [28]. Mars Pathfinder data show that a high proportion of rocks have basaltic chemical affinities strengthening the arguments for vesicular lavas in the near field. Influence of Illumination and Look Geometry. Restricted illumination and look angles and low resolutions of return surface images are factors in vesicle detection, identification and measurement. In order to evaluate these effects, controlled experiments documenting the textures and shapes of terrestrial samples have been done using known illumination angles and distances in field and laboratory exercises. These experiments show that (1) in the absence of extreme resolution data, vesicles are distinguished from pits of other origins the same way they are on Earth, by association more than distinctive characteristics, and (2) the resolution experiments show that, as a general rule, the natural size-distribution of vesicles allows useful information to be extracted from vesicular rocks at resolutions as low as 7 pixels per inch. Observation (2) implies that even in the event that image resolution is too low to detect the majority of vesicles, the shape of the vesicle size-distribution curve may be more useful than actual detection of all vesicles. In terrestrial samples the slopes of vesicle size- distribution for near-surface and interior vesicular zones differs substantially (Figure 1). The difference may relate to bubble growth from a near-uniform size initial population in most lavas, resulting in two growth  populations. An initial exponentially distributed population derives from conditions at the time of eruption and a secondary population arises from a separate growth law, coalescence, during flow emplacement and cooling. The two-population distribution only develops in flow interiors. Single-population distributions record near-initial vesicularities. Measurements of vesicles in single martian rocks may be useful in determining the relative depth of the sample within the original flow from which it has been excavated. For example, a single rock in Pathfinder rover image data (Soufflé) exhibits the characteristic curved distribution function typical of the lower part of an upper vesicular zone Discussion. Vesicle dimensions within a lava flow are a function of initial lava flow volatile retention, pressure at the crust-melt interface, and rate of solidification (time available Figure 1. Observed vesicle volume distribution as a function of depth within a lava flow.  VESICLES: Crumpler for bubble coalescence) [16]. The vesicularity at a given level within a lava flow is controlled by the gas law. Because the pressure that satisfies the ideal gas law has both atmospheric and hydrostatic terms, differences in vesicularity are expected to be relatively sensitive to differences in atmospheric pressure in the upper lava section [15; 20 ]. The atmospheric pressure of Mars is two orders of magnitude less than that on Earth, and terrestrial lava volatile abundances (~0.05 wt.%) in martian lavas would yield significantly higher vesicularities than that observed. Volume abundances approaching equilibrium degassing are likely, or several ppm. This implies that the initial (surface) vesicularity of martian samples cannot differ greatly from terrestrial rocks. Interior vesicularities at depths greater than a meter approach terrestrial values only if surface vesicularities far exceed the fragmentation limit [29] of 75-100% volume fraction of volatiles. For similar initial vesicularities, the vesicularity versus depth curve for martian lavas is predicted to  result in a much thinner vesicular zone and more vesicle-free interior. Martian basaltic lava flows are predicted to be largely vesiclefree compared with terrestrial lava flows, but of similar vesicularity in the upper one to two meters. For example, the upper range of lava surface vesicularity observed on earth is ~60% (consistent with fragmentation at or above this volatile content). Similar surface vesicularities on Mars under current conditions require only 6 ppm CO2. Vesicularities in flow interiors bearing similar surface (initial) vesicularity would be correspondingly lower than terrestrial flows reflecting dominance of the hydrostatic term. Even with an atmospheric pressure of 100 mb, vesicularity profiles will differ greatly from terrestrial values (Figure 2). Because the predicted vesicularity curve is sensitive to small changes in pressure,  higher atmospheric pressures will result in a different vesicle distribution in surface rocks. This is a potential means of documenting the broad characteristics of martian atmospheric pressure during the early history when many plains lavas were emplaced. Current work is (1) assessing the controls initial vesicularity in lavas, including rheological effects, and (2) reexamining sampled martian fields for evidence of undetected high vesicularities, documenting observed vesicularity variations in single blocks, and reviewing vesicle distribution theory to determine how robust pressure-dependent variations are on Earth.
