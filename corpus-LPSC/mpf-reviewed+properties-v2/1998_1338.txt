Introduction Aeolian dunes, composed of the sediment size fraction that is capable of saltation and traction, are useful as tools of scientific inquiry.  On Mars, dunes provide relatively dust-free surfaces that have potential for providing information on the composition of lithic and crystalline material.  For the past 25 years, it has been assumed that all aeolian dunes on Mars are dark (have a low albedo) relative to their surroundings.  Indeed, all of the largest martian dune fields have low albedos (� 0.15).  This picture recently began to change.  In terms of albedo relative to the terrain surrounding a dune field, there are three classes of dunes on Mars: (1) lower albedo, (2) albedo indistinct from the surroundings, and     (3) higher albedo.  The latter, dunes with a higher albedo than their surroundings, were not noticed until 1997. This paper discusses Viking observations of bright dunes found in the region west of Schiaparelli Basin, Mars (Fig. 1).  This work was stimulated by the search for Mars Surveyor '01 and '03 landing sites, and by new observations from Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Pathfinder, and Sojourner. Background and Historical Perspective (A) Dark and Indistinct-Albedo Dunes, Mariner 9 and Viking, 1972-1997.  The first Mars dunes were seen in Mariner 9 images [1].  Nearly all dunes described from Mariner 9 and Viking orbiter images have albedos that are low relative to their surroundings [e.g., 1-4].  From Viking orbiter images, some of the smaller dunes and dune-like bedforms that occur in troughs, channels, and among lava flows, appear to have albedos that are not dark, but are instead indistinguishable from their surroundings [e.g., 5, 6]. (B) Bright Dunes, Viking, 1997.  The first dunes that are bright relative to their surroundings were recognized by K. S. Edgett in Viking Orbiter 1 images from orbit 747 in August 1997 (Fig. 2).  The images were obtained in July 1978.  These bright dunes were shown in a talk about aeolian features in Sinus Meridiani presented to the Geol. Soc. America meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah, on 21 October 1997 (the abstract [7], written June 1997, does not mention the dunes). (C) Bright Dunes, Mars Global Surveyor, 1997.  More bright dunes were recognized by M. C. Malin (and team) when they released (on 10 November 1997) an image obtained 18 October 1997 by the Mars Global Surveyor camera (MOC) on orbit 23 (frame 6).  The MOC image shows a bright dune field on the floor of a channel on the southeast rim of Schiaparelli Basin [8]. (D) Bright Dune-like Drifts, Sojourner, 1997.  The poss ibility of bright dunes on Mars was bolstered by an observation that was made by Sojourner rover on 19 September 1997, when images were obtained that show bright drifts (resembling miniature dunes) located behind some rocks (the "Rock Garden") south of the Mars Pathfinder lander [9, 10]. The brightness of these drifts was suggested to indicate that they are not composed of dark, mafic sediment [10]. (E) Bright Dune-like Drifts, Mars Pathfinder, 1997.  Finally, the Mars Pathfinder imaging team claimed in December 1997 that two of the three � 15 cm-high drifts visible to the multispectral imager (IMP) appeared to be relatively bright [11].  It was suggested that these drifts, "Roadrunner" and "Jenkins," might be composed of "light"-colored grains (i.e., possibly felsic rather than basaltic material) [11]. Bright Dunes Southwest of Schiaparelli Basin (A) Setting of Dunes in Viking Orbiter 747A Images.  The first dunes that are brighter than their surroundings were observed by Viking Orbiter 1 on orbit 747 in 1978.  Images 747A #31-58 are all about 15 m/pixel and are focused on a set of valleys that apparently drained northwest toward a broad, relatively smooth, bright plain located west of Schiaparelli Basin (Fig. 1).  The smooth plain was proposed by Rice [12] to be a possible lacus trine deposit. (B) The Dunes in 747A Images.  Bright dunes are resolved on the floors of channels imaged on orbit 747A (e.g., Fig. 2).  The dunes are transverse and appear to be traveling up the valleys (i.e., north to south), consistent with present wind conditions.  Some low-albedo material is present, and provides a stark contrast with the bright dunes.  The pres ence of both low-albedo material and bright dunes suggests that the dunes may be active.  Dunes occur not only on channel floors, but also in depressions around an impact crater on the otherwise smooth-surfaced deposit north of the channels.  Where the channels contact the smooth deposit, the channel surface is topographically lower than the smooth deposit, suggesting that deflation has occurred.  It is possible that deflation of the smooth deposit is the source of the bright, saltatable grains that comprise the dunes. (C) Constraints on Albedo from Viking IRTM.  The dunes in the 747A images appear to be as bright or brighter than the smooth-surfaced deposit to their north (Figs. 1, 2).  The Viking infrared thermal mapper (IRTM)-derived albedo (from [13]) of the surface of the smooth deposit is about 0.21. Most dunes elsewhere on Mars have been reported to have much lower albedos, on order of � 0.15.  The albedo of the dunes in the 747A images might be higher than 0.21. Additional, Possible Bright Dunes Near Schiaparelli (A)  Viking Orbiter 411B Images.  A set of Viking Orbiter 2 images from orbit 411 cross diagonally from southwest to northeast across the smooth-surfaced bright unit west of Schiaparelli (Fig. 1).  These images have a ground resolution of about 26 m/pixel, but drop-outs in the data give an effective resolution closer to 75 m/pixel.  Regardless, one of the more intriguing images from this set is 411B91, which shows a channel that drained westward into an 80 km-diameter crater (Fig. 1).  The image (Fig. 3) shows a surface of sharp bright and dark contrasts.  The channel walls are dark except for a few bright, apparently layered outcrops.  The channel floors are bright.  No dune shapes are present. (B)  Interpretation of 411B Images.  Prior to recent observations of bright dunes, the standard interpretation of "BRIGHT" DUNES ON MARS:  K. S. Edgett and T. J. Parker 411B91 would be that the dark surfaces are areas of active aeolian sand transport, and the bright surfaces are areas of modern-day bright dust deposition.  However, the occurrence of bright dunes on channel floors seen elsewhere near Schiaparelli Basin (described above and from MGS images [8]), it is reasonable to speculate that the bright channel floor material in 411B91 (Fig. 3) is also attributable to aeolian dunes. Activity and Composition of Bright Dunes The bright dunes described here occur in Sinus Meridiani, a low-albedo region that has been presumed to have sufficient aeolian activity that bright dust does not accumulate there [7].  To find bright dunes among these dark surfaces suggests that the bright dunes, also, might be active and composed of bright sand rather than being coated by dust. The relatively high albedo of the dunes suggests that they are composed of something other than the mafic sands commonly assumed for most martian dune fields.  In the cases presented here, the bright dunes are associated with channel floors and a possible lake deposit.  The bright dunes might therefore be composed of minerals that were relatively resis tant to chemical and mechanical weathering during the Noachian Epoch, when liquid water was probably flowing in the channels.  Such minerals might include quartz and, perhaps, feldspars.  Alternatively, the dunes could contain minerals that precipitated from the proposed lacustrine environment, such as evaporites or carbonates. References:  [1] Sagan, C. et al.
