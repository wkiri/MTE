Introduction.  The recent success of the Mars Pathfinder mission and payload definitions for upcoming missions to the surface of Mars have lead us to an investigation into the properties of weathering rinds on rocks and the extent to which they obscure and/or are not representative of unweathered material beneath.  The magnitude of the influence of a rind is a complex function of its thickness, instrumental sampling volume, and the magnitude of contrast in instrument-sensitive properties between the rind and unweathered material.  A thick rind formed by isochemical weathering would not be consequential for an elemental analyzer but could completely block analysis of unweathered material by a mineralogical analyzer.  We consider here diffuse reflectance (visible and near-IR) and backscatter Mössbauer data for weathered and unweathered surfaces of a basaltic rock.  We also report theoretical calculations for the sampling depth of the 14.4 keV Mössbauer gamma ray for a basaltic composition. Sample and Methods.  The rock was a hand specimen of basalt (WD232) from Meridan, CN (Ward's Scientific). One side was a brown-colored surface, presumably formed during weathering prior to collection.  The rock was broken to obtain a fresh, unweathered surface.  Using a binocular microscope, the weathering rind (brown coloration) was estimated to be 200±20 µm thick.  A powder was obtained from interior chips with no visible weathered surfaces.  Diffuse reflecivity spectra (350-2100 nm) were obtained with a Cary-14 spectrophotometer.  Backscatter Mössbauer spectra were collected with a brassboard backscatter Mössbauer spectrometer (BaMS) developed at JSC with PIDDP funding.  For robotic deployment on a planetary surface, backscatter geometry (Mössbauer source and detector(s) on same side of sample) is used because no sample preparation is required for particulate samples and rock surfaces require backscatter geometry.  For comparison, transmission Mössbauer spectra were obtained on the rock powder with a conventional laboratory Mössbauer spectrometer (Ranger Scientific).  Mass absorption coefficients compiled by [1] for an energy of 15.0 keV were used to estimate the sampling depth of the Mössbauer 14.4 keV radiation at densities of 2.4, 3.5, and 5.3 g/cm3. Results and Discussion.  The reflectivity spectrum for the rock powder (Fig. 1) shows a spectral signature typical for Fe2+ in Ca-rich pyroxene [e.g., 2].  One of the two pyroxene bands is present at 950 nm and the other occurs beyond 2100 nm so that only a decreasing reflectivity beyond 1600 nm is observed in our data.  Spectral evidence for pyroxene is weak in the spectrum of the unweathered rock surface because the 950 nm minimum is not well defined.  Spectral evidence for pyroxene in the spectrum of the weathered rock surface is even less convincing.  The shallow minimum near 900 nm (goethite?) and the absorption edge from 400 to 780 nm are characteristics of Fe3+ [e.g., 3], not Fe2+.  The best evidence for pyroxene Fe2+ in the spectrum of the weathered surface is the decreasing reflectivity longward of 1600 nm. If the reflectivity data were restricted to the region between 400 and 1000 nm (as is the IMP multispectral data for Mars Pathfinder [4]), the spectra data for the weathered surface would be dominated by Fe3+ in the 200-µm thick weathering rind and the presence of pyroxene can not be reasonably inferred.  Similarly, it would not be possible to uniquely infer the presence of Fe2+ in pyroxene if only data from 400 to 1000 nm were available from the unweathered rock surface. Mössbauer spectra are shown in Fig. 2.  The transmission spectrum of the rock powder shows two overlapping pyroxene doublets (M1+M2 sites) and the two sextets for magnetite (A+B sites).  The backscatter spectrum of the unweathered rock surface shows clear evidence for pyroxene similar to the spectrum for the powder.  The lines from magnetite are also present, but not clearly because the counting statistics in the backscatter spectrum are not as good.  The backscatter Mössbauer spectrum of the weathered rock surface, unlike the reflectivity spectrum, shows clear evidence for pyroxene, and also a doublet from ferric iron.  The absence of a magnetic splitting (sextet) implies either a paramagnetic ferric speciation or a nanophase ferric oxide similar to that found in palagonitic tephra [e.g., 5]. The theoretical calculations of the absorption of the Mössbauer radiation by rinds having different thicknesses (Fig. 3) indicate that the 200 um thick rind on our basaltic rock will absorb 80-90% of the incident Mössbauer radiation. This amount of absorption is an upper limit because it assumes no penetration into the substrate (which is required to return a spectrum representative of the substrate) and it assumes 100% efficiency for backscattering the Mössbauer gamma rays.  Thus, it seems unlikely that the strong contribution of pyroxene in the backscatter spectrum of the weathered surface is entirely derived from pyroxene beneath the weathering rind.  More likely, the material in the rind is stained by ferric bearing material (possibly nanophase ferric oxides) and the pyroxene there is mostly unoxidized and present in greater abundance (with respect to number of iron atoms) than ferric-bearing phases.  However, the stain is sufficiently optically thick to virtually completely mask the presence of pyroxene.  These results suggest that the surfaces of rocks at the Mars Pathfinder landing site that are bright and  optically ferric [4] might be pyroxene rich and that this pyroxene will be detectable by the backscatter Mössbauer spectrometer that is part of the Athena payload for the Mars surveyor 2001 mission [6].
