Guelph (Guelph, ON N1G2M7 Canada).  Introduction: The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity, landed on Bradbury Rise within Gale crater on Mars, in August of 2012, and has since explored an ~12 km traverse en route to the 5 km high Aeolis Mons (Mount Sharp), exposed in the centre of the crater (Fig. 1). The rover's instrument payload has been used to investigate the rocks and soils encountered, with more detailed analyses performed at five locations: Yellowknife Bay, Darwin, Cooperstown, the Kimberley and Pahrump Hills; selected for their distinctive characteristics, observed from High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) orbiter images (Fig. 1).  The Canadian-built Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) has acquired 252 rock and 15 soil/regolith analyses up to sol 1200, recording a diversity of rock compositions. The chemical characteristics of the different rocks and soils analyzed along the rover traverse have allowed the APXS team to build a compositional classification scheme [1].                   Figure 1: APXS localization APXS Compositional Classes: Rocks and soils are classified based on trends observed for all elements analyzed by APXS and the scheme takes into consideration the geological and stratigraphic context of the analyzed targets.  The APXS classes are listed in Table 1, in the order in which they were first encountered and shown on a total alkalis versus silica plot in Figure 2.  Figure 2: APXS compositional classes plotted on a Total Alkalis versus Silica diagram. Discussion: This scheme, used in concert with the map of the rover traverse since landing, has identified regional trends in composition along the rover traverse, and has allowed the MSL science team to look for similarities and differences in composition associated with elevation and terrain type, as well as seek correlations with orbital spectral data.  The MSL APXS is a tried and tested planetary, geochemical exploration tool, and has proven invaluable at identifying compositional trends along the traverse within Gale crater, many of which are distinct from those discovered by MER or Pathfinder. It is the only instrument on the Curiosity rover capable of accurately measuring P, S, Cl, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cr, Br, Ge, Cu, Se, As, Pb, Ga, Rb, Sr and Y, and whose results can be directly compared with those of previous landed mission  results. Many of these elements have characteristic trends that aide in the identification of the different compositional classes and are important when looking for evid-  Table 1: Details of APXS compositional classification scheme.

Since landing, Curiosity has encountered a wide diversity of rock compositions with APXS, allowing for the development of this compositional classification scheme. The different compositions imply variations in the source rocks for the predominantly sedimentary lithologies observed, as well as providing indications of possible alteration and diagenetic events that may have taken place, either at source, or post-deposition. Selected Conclusions: To date, the APXS instrument has revealed that the majority of sedimentary lithologies encountered by Curiosity are basaltic in composition and are therefore likely to have basaltic protoliths (Fig. 2), a conclusion supported by XRD CheMin results [3].   Curiosity has however encountered a number of relatively alkaline and potassic rocks; specifically the high K, Mg and Fe Bathurst-class rocks and high Na, K, Si and Al Jake M-class rocks (Table 1), distinct from those analyzed on MER or Pathfinder and from SNC meteorites [4][5][6]. These lithologies are so far confined to the area in and around Cooperstown and the Kimberley (Fig. 1). This suggests a distinct and diverse crustal composition within and in the vicinity of Gale crater, having important implications for the igneous history of this region, which likely included potassic, alkaline and basaltic igneous activity [4][6].  The highest Ni contents so far measured by APXS on insitu rocks on Mars, are from raised nodular features within the Confidence Hills bedrock at Pahrump Hills. The elevated Ni is associated with elevated Mg and S and interpreted to represent post-depositional precipitation of Mg-Ni sulfates [7].  The trend in increasing Si content observed within bedrock encountered since arriving at the base of Mount Sharp  (Confidence Hills, Buckskin and Greenhorn classes; Fig.1, 2, Table 1) suggests leaching of Si by acid sulfate alteration [8] or Si addition during cementation and diagenesis [9].   This work will aim to provide further details of the APXS classes; the regional and stratigraphic trends and implications for sedimentary provenance, diagenesis and alteration; and Gale crustal composition.
