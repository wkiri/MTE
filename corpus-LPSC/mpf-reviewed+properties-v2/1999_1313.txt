Introduction. Mars Pathfinder landed at the depositional plains of the common mouth of Ares Vallis and Tiu Vallis [5]. Crater counts show that the valleyforming flows occured in several episodes within the period from about 3.5 to 1.5 b.y. ago [see e.g. 8,13]. The valleys originate within the Xanthe Terra and run northward for about 1500 km, then opening into the Chryse Planitia basin. They cut through the Noachian cratered plateau and Hesperian ridged plains which materials were expected to be sampled at the landing site [6]. The APX spectrometer of the Sojourner rover has analyzed eight rocks: Barnacle Bill, Yogi, Wedge, Shark, Half Dome (two analyses), Moe, Stimpy and Chimp [5]. Preliminary results of analyses of first five of them, after correction on their contamination with the airborn dust, were interpreted as evidence that they all have andesitic composition [14]. Our work analyzes morphology of eight mentioned rocks aiming to consider 1) if they are weathered; 2) if yes, what was the weathering rate; and 3) what was the distance of their transportation from the place of their origin as distinct petrologies to the place where they are now. It is based on the study of two sets of images: 1) super resolution stereo pairs produced from Super Panorama [11] and 2) images taken by the rover front cameras. 2. Observations. We concentrate our study on analysis of shape of the rocks and their surface texture. Shape of the rocks under study varies from highly irregular (Barnacle Bill) through transitional varieties to prismatic with planar facets (Wedge). Despite this variability, two characteristics of the rocks' shape are found to be typical: 1) Most of the rocks (Wedge, Shark, Half Dome, Stimpy, Chimp) have at least one planar facet (Fig.1).                    Fig.1, prismatic rock Wedge, 40x60cm. 2) Most of the rocks (Yogi, Shark, Half Dome, Moe, Stimpy, Chimp) have some part(s) looking rounded while other part(s) of the same rock look angular.                      Fig.2, Stimpy, hemisphere with three planar           facets, 30x50 cm. Surface texture of the rocks is determined by presence of numerous pits of a few mm to 1-3 cm in diameter. In some cases pits occupy only 20-30% of the surface area (Half Dome, Moe). Other rocks have surfaces saturated with pits and separating them knobs, so pits occupy at least 50-60% of the rock surface (Wedge, Chimp).                              Fig.3, pitted surface of Wedge, 10x20 cm. Pits vary in shape from segments of sphere or ellipsoid to irregular shape caverns. Rather similar pits were observed on the rocks of Viking 1 and 2 sites [3,10]. 3. Discussion. The observed characteristics of the rocks' shape and their surface texture can be interpreted in the following way: Weathering of the rocks. Pits on the Pathfinder and Viking rocks resemble both gas bubbles in the vesicular lavas and pits formed by weathering. This is why they were considered in the literature either as the MARS PATHFINDER ROCKS  A. T. Basilevsky et al. firsts [10], or as the seconds [9]. If to rely only on their morphology, the distinction among these options is practically impossible [1,12], especially taking in mind that the resolution of the available images of Martian rock is not better than about 1mm/px [5]. However joint consideration of the surface texture and the rock shape provides more reliable interpretation. As it was mentioned above, majority of the rocks has planar facets. The latter resulted evidently from the rock material fragmentation under the control of rock jointing [12] or tectonic fracturing [V.L. Feldman, personal communication]. If the pits were the gas bubbles, the rocks should be highly vesicular lavas which fragmentation should lead not to formation of planar facets but to irregular shape fragments. This conclusion is supported by our observations on natural fragmentation of the vesicular basalts of the Pisga volcano, California. If vesicles occupy not more than 20-30% of the rock volume the basalt is fragmented into fragments with rather planar facets. If vesicles occupy more space (up to 50-60%) basalt is fragmented into fragments of very irregular shape [2]. Because close up images of at least some of these rocks (Wedge, Chimp ) show high density of the pits and these given rocks have planar facets (Fig.1,3) these rock are evidently not composed of highly vesicular lavas, and pits on them are not the gas bubbles but resulted from weathering, e.g that described by [9]. Taking in mind that chemical composition of these rocks is beleived to be the same as of those which do not show planar facets (Barnacle Bill, Yogi) or have less density of pits (Half Dome, Moe) it seems probable that most pits on Pathfinder and Viking rocks, are resulted from some sort of weathering although some presence of gas bubbles can not be excluded. Distance of the rocks' transportation. Analysis of roundness/angularity of rock fragments, which are part of alluvial sediments, is a traditional approach to estimation of distances of their in-current transportation. Well-rounded rocks are considered to be transported from larger distances than the angular ones. In case of the analysis of the Pathfinder rock morphologies angularity of some rocks was interpreted as evidence of short distance of their transportation that, in turn, was considered as evidence that their source were volcanics of the Hesperian ridged plains [4]. Found by us different degrees of roundness/angularity observed at different parts of the same rocks (typical for six of eight studied rocks), at the first glance, are confusing. However more detailed consideration of this phenomenon showed that it is known in sedimentary petrology of Earth (so-called "broken pebbles"). Broken pebbles form when gradual increase of the particle roundness due to gradual in-current abrasion is interrupted by the impact breakage of the particle [7]. In case of the Pathfinder rocks, the observed difference in the roundness of different parts of the same rock can be explained by competition of incurrent rounding and also in-current episodic fragmentation. This means that the observed morphology of the rocks may and probably do indicate not to the distance to the rock primary source but to the place of its latest and previous episodes of the in-current fragmentation. So the source of the andesitic rocks found at the Pathfinder site may equally be either local (e.g., within the Hesperian ridged plains) or distant (e.g., within the Noachian cratered highlands). The weathering rate. If planar facets of the rocks resulted from the in-current fragmentation and their pitting resulted from weathering, the observed morphology of the rocks may be used for estimation of the weathering rate. As it was mentioned above, the latest valley-forming flows bringing the rocks from the upstream occurences could be about 1.5 b.y. ago [see e.g. 8,13].  So we assume 1.5 b.y. as the estimate of the duration of the weathering. To keep the rocks' edges sharp the weathered layer should be rather thin otherwise the edges would be rounded because they are more vulnerable to weathering than the surface of facets at some distance from the edge. The degree of rounding of the edge may be expressed through its radius of curvature. The by-eye estimate of the radius of curvature of the edges of planar facets showed that it is typically not more than 1-2 cm. This evidently means that the layer of the material removed by the weathering of the rocks is not thicker than a few centimeters. So the weathering rate of the APXS analyzed rocks and probably other rocks of the Pathfinder site as well was about 10-2 mm per a million years.
