 EXTREME ROCK DISTRIBUTIONS ON MARS.  M. P. Golombek, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech, Pasadena, CA 91109, mgolombek@jpl.nasa.gov. Introduction:  Prior to the landing of Mars Pathfinder, the size-frequency distribution of rocks from the two Viking landing sites and Earth analog surfaces was used to derive a size-frequency model for nomimal rock distributions on Mars [1]. This work, coupled with extensive testing of the Pathfinder airbag landing system [2], allowed an estimate of what total rock abundances derived from thermal differencing techniques [3] could be considered safe for landing. Predictions based on this model proved largely correct at predicting the size-frequency distribution of rocks at the Mars Pathfinder site and the fraction of potentially hazardous rocks. In this abstract, extreme rock distributions observed in Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images are compared with those observed at the three landing sites and model distributions as an additional constraint on potentially hazardous surfaces on Mars. Mars Rock Distributions:  The Viking landing sites and the Mars Pathfinder landing site show rock size-frequency distributions that largely follow an exponential when expressed in cumulative fractional area covered by rocks of a given diameter or larger versus diameter plots. The distributions can be fit by equations of the form: Fk(D) = k exp [-q(k) D], where Fk(D) is the cumulative fractional area covered by rocks of diameter D or larger, k is the total area covered by all rocks, and an exponential q(k), which governs how abruptly the area covered by rocks decreases with increasing diameter [1]. Similar rock distributions were also measured at a wide variety of rocky locations on the Earth. These similar distributions and the Viking distributions specifically, were used to develop a model size-frequency distribution for Mars in which k is equal to the total rock abundance [3] and the exponential, which from the Viking sites was approximated by q(k) = 1.79 + 0.152/k. These distributions form a family of non-crossing curves (Figure 1) that flatten out at small rock diameter at a total rock abundance of 5-40% [3]. The distribution of rocks measured at the Mars Pathfinder landing site [4] follows the model distribution for total rock abundance of 16% (Figure 1). The large size fraction in the measurement of the annulus 3-6 m from the lander is slightly skewed due to the presence of one large rock, Yogi, in a small counting area. For large rocks (before the resolution drop off at <1 m diameter) in the far field [5], the area covered is consistent with the model results for 16% rock abundance. Extreme Rock Distributions:  As a further test of these model rock distributions and the distribution of very large rocks on Mars in general, a survey of 25,000 released high-resolution MOC images revealed roughly 25 (~0.1% of the total) with fields of hundreds to thousands of boulders. These large and dense boulder fields were typically at the base of scarps or around fresh craters. Two 400 m and 500 m diameter fresh impact craters, 3 relatively fresh grabens, and the caldera scarps of Olympus Mons were counted. Boulders were fairly easy to identify as pairs of light and dark pixels (bright and shaded sides) on the images. The diameter was simply the number of pixels across, scaled for the image resolution, and emission angle. In practice, boulders down to one pixel diameter could be measured as a light and dark pixel pair. Although there was some uncertainty in the identification, it was generally repeatable, with two different observers yielding similar results [6]. Measured boulder diameter is probably within ±1 pixel. The smallest diameter boulder measured was about 1.6 m and the largest was just over 20 m. Of the six images with boulder fields counted, the maximum subareas are shown in Figure 1, which include the crater rims, the graben floors, and the Olympus Mons caldera scarps. In general, the average and minimum rock distributions in the boulder fields are a factor of 2-5 and 10 smaller, respectively, than the maxima, so that those shown here can be considered representative of the maximum boulder distributions on Mars. All of the fields have boulders 10 m in diameter or larger, with 0.1-3% area covered by boulders >5 m in diameter, 0.01-3% area covered by boulders >10 m in diameter, and <0.01% area covered by boulders ≥20 m diameter. Even though these distributions are up to an order of magnitude greater than the model rock distributions, the shape of the distributions are generally parallel to the model distributions showing the sharp decrease in area with increasing diameter. The flattening of the distributions at small diameter is probably a resolution effect, but even so, it is not clear what happens to these extreme distributions at smaller diameter. It is possible that the number of small rocks continues parallel to the model distributions, which would represent surfaces covered by 100% rocks. Although such large distributions are not observed in thermal differencing measurements at larger spatial scales observed from orbit (down to 3 km pixels [3]), they could exist on smaller spatial scales. Alternatively, the distribu EXTREME ROCK DISTRIBUTIONS ON MARS:  M. P. Golombek tions could flatten out at larger diameters or even be composed of multiple branches or segments [e.g., 7]. For reference, the maximum distribution of large rocks seen from a lander, on the rim of a crater in the far field of Viking 1, is elevated above that found in the near field [1], but the trend is parallel to the 30-40% model distributions at these diameters (Figure 1). Not shown are the plots of cumulative number of rocks per square meter versus diameter for the three landing sites and the boulder fields. These distributions can also be fit with exponential functions with noticeable curvature to the distributions at large and small diameters (on a log-log plot), but with more linear distributions at intermediate diameters. For the 3 landing sites, less than 0.01/m2 rocks ≥1 m diameter are present. For the boulder fields, 0.00004-0.0004/m2 rocks ≥5 meters diameter are present, and 10-6-10-3/m2 rocks ≥10 meters diameter. Implications for Nominal Rock Hazards:  These extreme rock distributions must be compared with those observed at the 3 landing sites to be placed in perspective. All three landing sites fall within the rockiest 15% of the planet [3]. In thermal measurements and surface rock counts [1, 3, 4], the three landing sites have total rock abundances of 15-20%, yet have <1% of their surfaces covered by rocks >1 m diameter. Furthermore, the highest resolution MOC images of the landing sites show at most one or two rocks in the entire imaged areas [8], which cover tens of square kilometers. This suggests 10-6-10-7/m2 rocks greater than a few meters diameter, which is consistent with extrapolations to these diameters from the measured populations at the landing sites and areas covered by these large rocks of thousandths of a percent. For reference, the Mars Pathfinder airbag system was successfully tested against surfaces with ≥10% area covered by rocks 1 m in diameter [2]. The airbag stroke was around 1 m and they withstood repeated impacts against multiple 0.5 m high rocks during testing. As a result, rocks greater than 1 m diameter were considered potentially hazardous, for typical height to diameter ratios of 0.5. The landing site constraint for Pathfinder and the preliminary constraint for the Mars Exploration Rover mission is ≤1% of the area be covered by rocks >0.5 m high. Note that the reconstruction of the Pathfinder landing indicates the lander bounced more than 15 times traversing about 1 km [9]. Airbag testing against a tilted platform showed the total impact area to be about 13 m2. If the lander bounced 1520 times, a total area of 195-260 m2 was sampled. For cumulative number 0.01/m2 rocks ≥1 m diameter measured at Pathfinder, 2-3 rocks of this size were likely encountered without damage during landing. Summary:  Comparison of MOC images with rare fields of hundreds to thousands of boulders 2-20 m in diameter with the three landing sites, where such boulders are virtually absent, suggests that most of Mars where boulders cannot be seen is relatively free of large rocks and thus safe for Pathfinder airbag landing. 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 0.01 0.1 1 10 Model 5% Model 10% Model 20% Model 30% Model 40% MPF MPF FF VL2 VL1 VL1 FF CR 201741CR 300265CR 202352GF 202582GF 306759GF 402248OM Cu mu la tiv e F ra ct io na l A re aDiameter (m) Figure 1.
