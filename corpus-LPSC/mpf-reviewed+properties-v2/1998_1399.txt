 MELTED SEDIMENT FROM MARS IN NAKHLA.  J. C. Bridges and M. M. Grady, Department of Mineralogy, Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW7 5BD, UK. Introduction Nakhla is an olivine-bearing clinopyroxenite, formed by melt differentiation within a thick (probably > 100 m) basaltic lava flow or shallow intrusion on Mars [1]. The presence of carbonate in Nakhla was first inferred from the results of stepped combustion analyses and attributed to hydrothermal alteration of the parent rock on Mars [2]. Traces of Ca-carbonate, halite and gypsum/anhydrite were subsequently found in a petrographic study [3].  Siderite (FeCO3) was first recognized within Nakhla by Chatzitheodoridis and Turner [4]. Carbonate minerals in martian meteorites have been a focus of recent research because they contain information about crustal and atmospheric reservoirs on Mars.  For instance, siderite in Nakhla has δ13C ≈ + 50 ‰ [5] - a value which is enriched in 13C compared to bulk Nakhla (δ13C = - 12 ‰[4]). On this basis, it was suggested that the carbonates formed by precipitation from a fluid in contact with the 13C-rich martian atmosphere.  High δ18O values (+ 32- + 35 ‰) in siderite grains have also been interpreted as a hydrothermal signature [6]. Here we report the results of a new mineralogical and trace element study of this assemblage. Techniques Polished sections of Nakhla (Sample BM 1913, 26) were prepared with oil to prevent loss of soluble salts and then analysed using a Cameca SX50 microprobe at 12 kV, 10 nA and 3 µm spot size.  Calibrations were checked by analysing a siderite standard (BM 1968, 648).  Trace element analyses of siderite were made with a Cameca IMS3f, using an O- primary beam with net energy 15 kV and a 20 µm spot size.  Calibrations were checked with the siderite standard (previously analysed by ICP AES) and a glass standard (NBS 610). Results One polished section of Nakhla contains 1-2 vol. % of halite and associated phases, although in some sections none was found, suggesting that this mineral is unevenly distributed within Nakhla.  Halite is almost entirely present within the interstitial areas, together with feldspar and a silica polymorph, as grains that are up to 400 µm diameter.  Halite forms poikilitic textures (Fig. 1a) which show that it crystallised from a melt around euhedral grains of plagioclase and silica.  Replacement of pre-existing minerals by low-temperature brines would, in contrast, produce a network of veins similar to those of the clay that cuts the olivine grains in this meteorite.  There is no evidence for reaction between silicate phases and the halite, and no hydrous phases are present in the interstitial areas.  Anhydrite, chlorapatite and siderite grains are also present within the interstitial areas, sometimes enclosed within halite showing that they too crystallised from interstitial melt (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1A, B.  A. Halite (h) has crystallised from a melt around euhedral grains of plagioclase (pl) and a silica polymorph (sa).  Halite also encloses chlorapatite (ca).  The halite, plagioclase and silica are present within the interstitial areas of Nakhla, inbetween cumulus grains of augite (a).  B.  Halite (400 µm across) encloses grains of siderite (sd) and anhydrite (an) and is in turn enclosed between augite grains.  The straight crystal faces and regular crystal terminations are consistent with the halite and its enclosed assemblage having crystallised from an interstitial melt. Carbonate has a range of compositions (mol %) calcite (CaCO3) 0.1-5.7, magnesite (MgCO3) 4.8-36.9, siderite (FeCO3) 23.2-87.0, rhodochrosite (MnCO3) 1.0-39.9 that shows the presence of a miscibility gap between high- and low-Mn carbonates (Fig. 2).  A lack of experimental data for the MnCO3-MgCO3-FeCO3 system [7] precludes firm temperature constraints for the solvus but it must be present at the temperatures under which melt is present. Siderite grains in Nakhla have smooth C1 normalised patterns from La to Ho (LREE > HREE) and there is no discernable Eu anomaly.  In contrast, siderite standard BM MELTED SEDIMENT FROM MARS:  J. C. Bridges and M. M. Grady 1968, 648, which is of hydrothermal origin, has LREE < HREE.  Anhydrite has a flat pattern of REE abundances with a positive Eu anomaly.  A more detailed report on the trace element analyses will be given at a later date. MnCO3 MgCO3 FeCO3 800-1200oC Fig. 2.  MnCO3-MgCO3-FeCO3 (mol %) plot of Nakhla carbonate composition.  There is a division between high- and low-Mn carbonate compositions, which are separated by a solvus.  One (dashed) tie line is drawn between two such compositional areas within one mineral grain.  Based on the observation that siderite crystallised at the same time as halite, the miscibility gap must have been present at temperatures above the melting point of halite (800oC).  N = 25. Discussion  The nature of the martian land surface onto and under which volcanic activity occurred, has been the subject of increased interest as results from the recent Pathfinder mission have been reported.  In particular, the Pathfinder results have shown the presence of flood plain deposits in the Ares Vallis region.  Chemical and spectral analyses have indicated that the area is underlain by a sulphate-rich, cemented hardground [8,9] consistent with the action of groundwater flow at some time in the past.  Viking Lander data also suggest that CO3 is present in martian soil [10].  It is possible, therefore, that salt and carbonate deposits may have precipitated from Cl-, SO4-, CO3-rich groundwater and could be a common deposit on or near the martian surface [11].  The closest terrestrial analogues would be those saltpan evaporite deposits which are formed through evaporative concentration of groundwater [12].  The assemblage haliteanhydrite-carbonate is typical of evaporites on Earth thus the corresponding association in Nakhla may originally have been derived from an evaporite-like, sedimentary source.  However, the textural relationships of this assemblage in Nakhla suggest it crystallised from a melt.  It may, therefore, have formed through the melting and incorporation of evaporitelike material into magma from which Nakhla originated. Halite melts at 800oC and the presence of carbonate and sulphate impurities will act to lower this liquidus temperature [13]. The Nakhla parent basalt temperature must have reached > 1200oC so the presence of this magma adjacent to salt-rich deposits would have caused localised melting.  Some carbonate, chloride and sulphate may have been lost by degassing through the lava but much was probably trapped as an immiscible fraction within the silicate melt. Alkali-rich carbonate liquids are known to be stable at low (1 bar) pressures [14] but there is no experimental data on Fe-rich carbonate/melt systems.  High contents of halogens and alkalis, such as that in the salt melt composition envisaged here are known to stabilise liquid Ca-carbonate at low pressures [15] and might stabilise Fe-rich carbonate melt as well. Igneous siderite is rare but has been reported from some terrestrial carbonatites [16]. A similar process of sediment melting has occurred around dolerite intrusions that cut evaporite and carbonate beds of Cambrian age in Irkutsk [17].  This is shown by coarse grains of anhydrite and halite at the contact of a dolerite dyke which have resulted from melting of the surrounding sediments. Our model can also explain the atmospheric 13C signature and 18O-enrichment of siderite within Nakhla.  These isotopic compositions are relics of the sedimentary precursors that were incoporated into the salt melt.  The minerals derived from the salt melt did not undergo isotopic exchange with the silicate minerals. Conclusions  Poikilitic textures show that halite grains, which are up to 400 microns in length and present in the interstitial areas of Nakhla, are igneous and not hydrothermal as previously suggested.  Similarly, siderite, anhydrite and chlorapatite crystallised from a salt-rich fraction of residual melt.  We suggest that the salt melt component was derived from melting at > 800oC of adjacent evaporite-like rocks in hardgrounds on or near the surface of Mars.  The REE abundances of the siderite are different from those of siderite with a terrestrial, hydrothermal origin.  Incorporation of sediment can help explain the high δ13C values and other martian atmospheric isotopic signatures reported from this meteorite.
