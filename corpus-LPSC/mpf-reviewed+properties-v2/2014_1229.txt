Introduction:  Acidic weathering of basalt has received significant attention as a dominant style of weathering on Mars because of the abundance of sulfates present on the surface [1, 2]. A previous study by Tosca et al. [3] focused primarily on the solution chemistry and secondary mineralogy of these acid alterations with Pathfinder basalt and glass. Although the process of acidic weathering of basalt is well understood, it has been difficult to assess this process globally.  Remote spectral measurements used for compositional analysis are complicated by non-linear spectral mixing, particularly for altered surfaces where there are a variety of grain sizes, textures and coating geometries [4]. These coatings can induce non-linear mixing because they cause scattering, which can decrease the spectral contrast of the features. Scattering occurs when the surface is rough or the radius of the grain is smaller than the wavelength of the energy source. In addition to surface scattering, there can also be changes in spectral shape due to increased transmission through grains with a smaller particle size. Thus, the infrared (IR) spectral character of an acid-weathered basalt or glass is not easily predicted using linear mixing models.       In this study, geochemical experiments are linked with IR spectral measurements to understand basalt weathering and regolith development on Mars. This will allow for the direct comparison of laboratory spectral data to TES, Mini-TES, and CRISM/OMEGA data, which will expand the assessment of the extent of acidic Martian alteration to include more locations than just landing sites. It was postulated that Mars underwent global acidification, resulting in the sulfates that exist on the current surface [5].       This experiment aims to answer two important questions regarding the environmental history of Mars. 1) What was the dominant style of weathering and 2) how did weathering conditions vary spatially and temporally? Understanding the alteration processes that occur on Mars will help unravel the history of the Martian climate and past geologic events.      Procedures Overview: The procedural outline of this experiment was to (1) synthesize basaltic glass and rock of Irvine composition [6]; (2) react samples (63µm - 400µm grains) with acidic fluids (0-4 pH) and a constant water-to-rock ratio of 1, under ambient temperature and pressure; (3) evaporate the fluids from the basalt after a 14 day reaction period [3]; and (4) perform mineralogical and spectral analyses on the unaltered and altered material.  A variety of analytical methods including electron microprobe, SEM, XRD, Raman, VNIR and TIR spectroscopy were used to examine the unaltered and altered samples. TIR emission spectra were acquired between approximately 350-2000cm-1.VNIR (3502500nm) bidirectional reflectance spectra were acquired with incidence and emergence angles of 30° and 0°, respectively.      Starting Material:  Because the alteration assemblage is dependent on the starting composition [3], it is preferable to start with a known Martian basalt composition. In-situ chemical data gathered from the Mars Exploration Rovers provides a variety of Martian basalt compositions to choose from. Gusev Crater contains several basalts that are considered to be the least altered Martian rocks [6]. "Irvine" (Table 1), a rock found on the crest of Husband Hill in Gusev Crater, was chosen as the first starting composition because it is a relatively unaltered, aphanitic, rock with a basaltic composition.

The components were homogenized by grinding in an automatic agate mortar/pestle in 35 minute intervals for a total of approximately 3 hours. The mixture was then added to a large volume graphite capsule and melted at 1400°C (176 bars, overpressurized to 212 bars). After 3 hours at 1400°C the assemblage is quenched, resulting in a glass. A stepwise cooling method is programmed for the crystalline sample. The glass was analyzed by microprobe and compared to target composition.
