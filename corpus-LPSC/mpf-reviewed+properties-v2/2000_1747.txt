 CRITERIA FOR REMOTE SENSING DETECTION OF SULFATE CEMENTED SOILS ON MARS. Christopher. D. Cooper and John F. Mustard, Department of Geological Sciences, Box 1846, Brown University, Providence RI, 02912  (Christopher_Cooper@brown.edu). Spectral measurements of loose and cemented mixtures of palagonitic soil and sulfates were made to determine whether cemented soils could be identified on Mars.  Cemented MgSO4 mixtures exhibit an enhanced 9 µm sulfate fundamental compared to gypsum mixtures due to more diffuse and pervasive cementing. Introduction:  The Viking and Pathfinder landers measured abundant sulfur in the Martian surface materials [1,2,3].  Higher concentrations in cohesive materials have been interpreted as cementation by sulfate salts, likely with magnesium as the cation [1,4].  Furthermore some regions of Mars have a dark red color, intermediate albedo, and intermediate thermal inertia that have been interpreted as indicating regional extents of this type of cemented, crusty soil [5,6,7].  So far, spectroscopic remote sensing has only found a few weak sulfate features in near-infrared observations of Mars [8].  Particulate mixtures of magnesium sulfate and palagonitic soil exhibit different spectral properties from cemented mixtures of the same compositions [9,10].  Spectra of these mixtures are dominated by the palagonite, while cemented mixtures have a much stronger sulfate contribution, especially around the 9 µm fundamental.  These differences appear to be due to the cementation process and not just changes in the packing or porosity of the samples [10]. To further investigate these observations, we have created gypsum cemented analogs to compare with the previous magnesium sulfate mixtures.  In addition to previous reflectance measurements, off-axis spectra were taken to eliminate the specular component.  Thin sections of cemented materials were also prepared for elemental analysis in a microprobe. Samples:  Loose powder and cemented mixtures of palagonitic soil and magnesium sulfate from our previous studies [9,10] were used, as well as newly prepared mixtures of palagonitic soil and gypsum.  Some palagonitic soils, which are amorphous or weakly crystalline materials from the weathering of basaltic glass, are good spectral analogs for the Martian soil [11,12]. The palagonitic soil used to make the sulfate mixtures studied here was the JSC Mars-1 analog material, a well-characterized altered tephra from Mauna Kea [13]. Five mixtures of palagonite with magnesium sulfate and two mixtures with gypsum were made with sulfate compositions (Table I) bracketing the Viking and Pathfinder measurements of SO3 in the Martian soil [2,3].  Pure endmembers (palagonitic soil and sulfates) were prepared in the same way as the mixtures.  Samples were cemented by adding a small amount of water to form a paste.  The paste was packed into a container and dried in an oven. Spectral Observations: The mixtures and endmembers were measured in the RELAB bidirectional spectrometer and in the environmental accessory chamber of the RELAB Nicolet FTIR spectrometer.  The environmental chamber provided off-axis biconical reflectance measurements in the mid-infrared that do not suffer from specular reflections.  These spectra were spliced with the RELAB measurements to fix the absolute reflectance scale. MgSO4-cemented palagonites have a very strong sulfate fundamental at 9 µm that is not apparent in the spectra of loose powder mixtures (Fig. 1).  This peak grows steadily as the amount of magnesium sulfate is increased.  In contrast, the same feature in the gypsumcemented materials is much weaker (Fig. 2).  Although pure gypsum and pure magnesium sulfate have sulfate fundamentals of similar strength, cemented mixtures of gypsum have very weak features compared to equivalent cemented mixtures of MgSO4.  This contrast in spectral behavior of the two types of sulfate-cemented mixtures could be diagnostic in identifying sulfate compositions in soils from mid-infrared spectra, provided that the underlying cause of the difference is understood and is applicable to natural samples. Microscopic Observations:  To investigate the cause of the difference in the mid-infrared behavior of the two types of sulfate-cemented samples, thin sections were prepared for microprobing and elemental mapping.  Cemented samples were impregnated with epoxy and ground and polished using ethanol.  Backscattered electron images and elemental maps for sulfur, calcium, and magnesium were made to investigate the microscopic structure of the samples and the relationships between sulfate and silicate minerals.

D. Cooper and J. F. Mustard The magnesium sulfate-cemented sample only had a few discreet sulfate grains.  Most of the sulfur and magnesium was instead diffusely scattered in the matrix around silicate grains.  In contrast, the sulfur and calcium in the gypsum sample were located almost exclusively in larger grains and not in the matrix. These relationships are due to the different solubilities of the two sulfates.  MgSO4 dissolves completely and reprecipitates in a very fine-grained matrix surrounding the silicate grains from the palagonitic soil.  This forms a very strong matrix and causes the samples to become very hard and cohesive.  Gypsum, with a much lower solubility, does not form a uniform or complete matrix.  Instead it remains in discreet grains, which results in a very weakly cemented material. Implications:  These microscopic differences in the structure of the cemented soils cause the variations in the strength of the mid-infrared spectral features. Spectral properties of cemented materials:  When mixtures of sulfates and silicates are cemented by wetting and drying, the material becomes more compacted and less porous.  However, the key difference for spectral properties is the completeness and continuity of the matrix of cement that is formed.  In well-cemented samples (e.g. magnesium sulfate) the behavior is more like a solid of the composition of the matrix with a large degree of impurities.  The matrix forms a larger, more coherent scattering and emitting surface that dominates the mid-infrared spectral properties.  In contrast, weakly cemented materials with a very discontinuous matrix behave as packed particulates.  There is no coherent surface for scattering and emission. Implications for observations of Mars:  The very different mid-infrared behaviors of the two types of cemented sulfate mixtures should allow for the identification of the physical state of sulfate present in soils on Mars.  Exposures of MgSO4-cemented duricrust on the 10% level on the surface of Mars should be detectable [10].  Furthermore, given an independent measure of the composition of the sulfate [i.e. 1,4], the strength of any observed sulfate fundamentals could shed light into the degree to which the sulfate has dissolved and reprecipitated in the Martian regolith.
