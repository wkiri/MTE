 FRACTIONATION AMONG LARGE-ION LITHOPHILE ELEMENTS DURING THE DIFFERENTIATION OF MARS:  IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE MARTIAN PRIMITIVE MANTLE.  Scott M. McLennan, Department of Geosciences, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, 11794-2100, USA (Scott.McLennan@sunysb.edu). Introduction: The ratios between moderately volatile large ion lithophile (LIL) elements, such as K and Rb, and refractory LIL elements, such as Th, U, and the LREE are very important constraints on models for the origin and chemical composition of the primitive mantles of planets [e.g., Ref. 1].  Ratios among these highly incompatible elements are generally thought to change little during magmatic differentiation and thus the ratios measured in surface igneous rocks across a broad compositional range typically are rather uniform and thus are thought to be representative of planetary values.  In this paper, it is suggested that in fact there may be a substantial and systematic fractionation of K/Th, K/U, and K/La ratios among SNC meteorites and between SNC meteorites and independent estimates of the surface composition of Mars.  This fractionation leads to an over-estimate of the moderately volatile - refractory element ratios for the Martian primitive mantle based predominantly on the SNC meteorites.  Accordingly, the Martian primitive mantle may be more depleted in moderately volatile elements than some compositional models have proposed. Models for Mars Primitive Mantle Composition: A number of models have been proposed for the composition of the Martian primitive mantle [e.g., 2-4]. The most influential is based largely on the composition of SNC meteorites, especially those from the shergottite family [3, 5-8], and indicates a volatile-rich primitive mantle with K/U of just over 19,000 (K/La=635; K/Th=5,445).  This compares with the Earth's primitive mantle which is generally thought to have a K/U ratio of about 10,000, K/La of about 325 and K/Th of about 2800 [1].  The number of SNC meteorites, and especially of basaltic shergottites, has increased dramatically over the past several years and accordingly it is worthwhile to re-evaluate the relationships among moderately volatile and refractory elements within SNC meteorites. Influence of Recent Weathering on SNC Compositions:  It is now recognized that a number of the SNC meteorites have witnessed terrestrial weathering effects that may have significantly changed their trace element compositions, notably for U, K and possibly LREE [9-12].  Such effects, if common, could make it very difficult to evaluate any of the LIL distributions in SNC meteorites because many LIL elements in addition to K and U (e.g., Rb, Cs, Ba) are susceptible to redistribution during such processes.  One of the effects can be seen in Fig. 1 which plots Th vs. U abundances for the Martian meteorites.  Most of the SNC meteorites plot along the CI Th/U ratio of about 3.5. However, several plot at Th/U<1.0 likely reflecting addition of U during terrestrial weathering.  Accordingly, this diagram provides a useful 'filter' for distinguishing samples that may have been affected by these secondary processes.  Potassium is similarly affected but to a lesser degree and so the K/U ratio of DaG476, DaG489 and SaU005 are all significantly lower than the other SNC meteorites. 0.01 0.1 1T h ( pp m) 0.01 0.1 1 U (ppm) Basaltic Shergottites Other SNC Meteorites Th /U =3 .5 (C I) Phobos-2 GRS DaG476 SaU005 DaG489 Fig. 1  Plot of Th versus U for SNC meteorites [9-16] and the range of orbital gamma-ray spectroscopy (GRS) data from the Phobos-2 mission [17].  Most samples plot close to the CI Th/U ratio of 3.5 but several (DaG476, DaG489, SaU005) have much lower Th/U ratios indicative of U-addition during terrestrial weathering processes. Moderately Volatile - Refractory Element Relationships on Mars:  Figure 2 summarizes the K-Th relationships for the various Martian compositions, excluding the three basaltic shergottites that show evidence for terrestrial weathering effects (DaG476, DaG489, SaU005).  The K-U relationships (not shown) show similar trends but there are fewer available analyses.  The meteorite data exhibit a clear negative correlation between K/Th ratio and K (and Th) abundances suggesting fractionation among these LIL elements probably during igneous differentiation processes.  Further supporting this suggestion is the fact that the available surface gamma-ray spectroscopy (GRS) data from Phobos-2 [17] also plot on the same trend at even lower K/Th and K/U ratios.  Less well defined negative trends also exist on plots K/La vs. K  LARGE ION LITHOPHILE ELEMENTS IN THE MARTIAN PRIMITIVE MANTLE:  S. M. McLennan and possibly La/Th vs. La.  The former is reverse that expected for a control from simple differences in incompatibility since K is generally though to be more incompatible than La and thus with increasing K, the K/La ratio might be expected to increase. 02000 4000 6000 8000 10000 K / T h 100 1000 10000 K (ppm) Basaltic Shergottites Other SNC Meteorites Phobos-2 GRS Mars W&D '88 Earth T&M '85 ++ Fig. 2.

Mars primitive mantle composition from Wänke and Dreibus [3] and Earth primitive mantle from Taylor and McLennan [18].  Note that the shergottites show a clear trend of decreasing K/Th ratio with increasing K content and that the GRS data are consistent with this trend.  These data suggest that the Martian crust has a significantly lower K/Th ratio than the depleted mantle that is reflected in most of the SNC samples, and thus are consistent with the primitive mantle having some intermediate value. Discussion:  It is perhaps not surprising that significant fractionation among the highly incompatible elements takes place on Mars.  For example, on Earth it is well documented that K/Rb ratios can be significantly higher in igneous and metamorphic rocks that are highly depleted in LIL elements, such as ocean tholeiites, low-K calc-alkaline basalts, and some granulites [e.g., 19, 20].  Many of the SNC meteorites have come from highly depleted mantle sources and so LIL element relationships perhaps better reflect the composition of a depleted Martian mantle reservoir that differs significantly from the primitive mantle. Both the GRS data and the Pathfinder and Viking soil data suggest that the enriched reservoir within the crust has relatively high concentrations of incompatible elements (e.g., average crustal K of about 5,000 ppm) [21].  The crust may also have significantly lower K/Th, K/U and K/La ratios than the depleted mantle of Mars (Fig. 2).  Thus, if the enriched crustal reservoir is characterized by lower K/Th, K/U and K/La ratios then the overall effect on primitive mantle compositions will depend on the mass balance of LIL elements between crust and depleted mantle. Geophysical data suggest that the Martian crust is on the order of 3-4% of the mass of the planet [22-24] and geochemical mass balance arguments [21, 25] suggest that as much as 50% of the planetary complement of LIL elements may reside in the enriched crustal reservoir.  On the other hand, even if the enriched crustal reservoir of Mars contains as much as 50% of the planet's inventory of the most incompatible elements, it is still a volatile-rich planet compared to the Earth.  However, the level of volatile-enrichment may be significantly less than previously suggested.  In contrast to the primitive mantle of the Earth, which has a K/U ratio of about 10,000, the Martian primitive mantle likely has a K/U ratio of about 14,000-15,000 rather than the previously suggested value of about 19,000, which was based on SNC meteorites alone.
