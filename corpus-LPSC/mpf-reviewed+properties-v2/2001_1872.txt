Introduction: Low albedo intracrater materials and adjacent wind streaks in Western Arabia Terra are examined using atmospherically corrected surface spectra from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES).  Questions addressed in this study include 1) What are the compositions of these surfaces? and 2) Can compositions and distributions be used to constrain origin hypotheses for these materials and tie them to bedrock lithologies?  Background: The physical properties of, and genetic link between, low albedo intracrater materials and wind streaks in Western Arabia Terra (Figure 1) have been the subject of considerable study and debate for nearly 3 decades [e.g., 1-6].  Models for the formation of dark intracrater "splotches" involve the entrapment of sand sized particles that can be transported into, but not out of, craters by wind [e.g., 2, 4, 5] .  Supporting evidence for an eolian origin of these materials comes from Mariner 9, Viking, and MGS Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) high resolution observations of dune fields in many dark intracrater features [e.g., 1-6].  Several hypotheses exist for the origin of adjacent low albedo wind streaks.  Some models interpret them to be a result of saltation and traction, consisting of sandy material deflated from adjacent dark intracrater deposits [2, 7] or the result of material being stripped from the surface to reveal a darker substrate [e.g., 8].  Conversely, [9] proposed that dark wind streaks formed by the deposition of fine dark silt from plumes of suspended material. This view is now supported by MOC observations that suggest the dark materials are mantle deposits of fine grained sediment deflated from adjacent crater floors, not sand sized particles [10]. TES Dataset:  Individual TES spectra of Western Arabia Terra were deconvolved using the global martian surface and atmospheric spectral endmembers from [11] to derive compositions for low albedo intracrater materials and adjacent wind streaks.  Atmo spherically corrected TES spectra [12-13] were constrained by low atmospheric dust and water-ice opacities, warm surface temperatures, and low emission angles.  The three surface units identified and mapped are basalt, andesite, and dust. Results:  Deconvolved TES spectra of low albedo intracrater materials in Western Arabia Terra reveal basaltic and andesitic surface compositions within individual features.  Basaltic compositions form a central core in dark features on crater floors while andesitic compositions form a surrounding arc on the dark downwind sides of crater walls.  Mixing of these compositions appears to occur near the floor-wall interface within impact craters.  Similar compositions are observed in the adjacent low albedo wind streaks as basalt materials appear to mix with and eventually grade toward andesite materials with increasing distance south from crater rims. There does not appear to be a discernable compositional difference across (east-west) dark wind streak material and the often observed bright red deposits along their margins. Figure 2 shows a composite MOC image of Radau Crater which is outlined with a white box in the Viking image of Figure 1.  Radau Crater (17 oN, 5 oW) is ~ 125 km across and is representative of many large impact craters in Western Arabia Terra that have both an intracrater low albedo feature on part of the southern crater floor and an adjacent dark wind streak that extends southward from the dark material.  Figure 3 is a TES compositional map of Radau Crater clearly showing the core of basalt (green) and surrounding arc of andesite (red) with mixing (yellow) in the intracrater low albedo feature and the s imilar gradational basalt to andesite trend in the adjacent dark wind streak.  Blue represents fine-grained bright dust cover.  Discussion:  Observations of barchan dunes in  floors of dark intracrater features strongly support the hypothesis that these materials are eolian in origin, sand sized, and marginally mobile.  This surface correlates with basaltic compositions identified in cores of low albedo intracrater features.  High resolution MOC images have shown that dunes are not observed in low albedo material covering the southern walls and rims of the same craters.  This material correlates with andesitic surface compositions that form an arc around intracrater basaltic materials.  Sorting of particle sizes within dark intracrater features could be controlling the observed spatial distribution of basaltic and andesitic surface compositions.  The coarsest basalt material near the center of the crater (north end of intracrater splotches) grades to finer andesitic material further transported downwind (southward) and partially up crater walls.  Preliminary thermal inertia data of low albedo intracrater features , which can be used to estimate the effective particle size of unconsolidated material, also may be interpreted as indicating a fining of  DARK INTRACRATER MATERIALS AND WIND STREAKS:   M.

It is thus difficult to tie these basalt and andesite surface compositions back to bedrock lithologies because of their mobile nature within craters and if their origins are from outside craters.  Another hypothesis to explain compositional variations within intracrater features is that andesite is being eroded down from layers within crater walls, instead of being transported up, with basalt material still owing its origin to sand material blown in by wind and entrapped by crater depressions.  MOC and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data have been used to show that some crater walls are covered by what appears to be loose, granular material that is at the angle of repose near crater rims [10].  Furthermore, outcrops and streaks in crater walls have been observed to run down-slope, suggesting that andesite material may be eroding and sliding down the slope surface.  The possible existence of in-place andesite layers in crater walls is consis tent with the Mars Pathfinder conclusion that the material in this region is andesitic in composition [14].   Adjacent low albedo wind streaks show a similar compositional trend to dark intracrater features with basalt grading to andesite in the direction of wind flow and thus could imply a similar trend of decreasing particle sizes. Finer grained particles (e.g. silt) in wind streaks would agree with the lack of observed dunes (formed by sand sized particles) in MOC high resolution images and would support  models that propose dark wind streaks form by the deposition of fine dark silt from plumes of suspended material. However, preliminary thermal inertia data indicates that particle sizes in wind streaks are roughly similar to the sand sized particles in intracrater deposits.  This observation could support models that propose wind streaks are erosional surfaces in the lee of southern crater rims or that they are protected remnants of an older surface.  Albedo differences observed in wind streaks, perhaps due to variable dust cover, need to be further studied and correlated with surface compositions.  References: [1] Sagan C. et al.
