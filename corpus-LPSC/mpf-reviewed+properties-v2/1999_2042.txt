SULFATES ON MARS: SPECTROSCOPIC EVALUATION OF ANALOG MIXTURES.  Christopher D. Cooper and John F. Mustard, Department of Geological Science, Box 1846, Brown University, Providence RI, 02912.  (Christopher_Cooper@brown.edu). Introduction:  Abundant sulfur was detected in the Martian surface material by the Viking Landers, with higher concentrations occurring in crusts and clods [1,2].  Cementation by sulfate salts has been proposed to explain the higher sulfate abundance in the more cohesive materials, with magnesium as the likely cation [1,3].  In addition, there are a number of regions on Mars with a dark red color, intermediate albedo, and intermediate thermal inertia [4,5,6] that appear to have a unique mineral composition [7] and are thought to consist of regionally extensive cemented material analogous to the smaller clods found at the landing sites.  The high sulfur concentration and its apparent mobility have important implications for understanding surface compositions and pedogenic processes on Mars. A weak 4.5 µm band attributed to sulfate has been observed in some telescopic spectra [8].  However, it did not appear to have the same pattern of absorptions seen in pure MgSO4, gypsum, or anhydrite.  A fundamental question thus arises: what are the detection limits of sulfates on Mars?  Furthermore, how does the physical form (e.g. powders vs. crusts) affect detection? To address these questions we prepared a series of mixtures of palagonite and magnesium sulfate with proportions to match the high sulfur concentrations detected on Mars.  Laboratory reflectance spectra were obtained of the powder mixtures and of simulated duricrusts made from these mixtures.  Distinctive differences between cemented and powder mixtures in the mid-infrared will allow identification of regions of crusted soil on Mars. Samples:  Some palagonites (amorphous or weakly crystalline weathering products of basaltic glass) are good spectral analogs for the Martian soil [9,10].  The JSC Mars-1 palagonite is a well characterized material [11] that is a useful medium for these experiments.  The objective to simulate processes in the Martian soil requires fine-grained materials and thus the JSC Mars-1 was dry sieved to produce a 1520 µm fraction.  This size fraction was mixed in six different proportions with reagent grade anhydrous magnesium sulfate to create analogs to the Martian soil.  The six mixtures have added MgSO4 concentrations of 2.58, 5.06, 7.41, 9.98, 12.39, and 17.92% by weight.  The chemical compositions of the palagonite mixtures were calculated from the composition of JSC Mars-1 [11] and are compared with Viking and Pathfinder measurements in Table II.  Biconical reflectance from 0.9 to 26 µm was measured in a Nicolet FTIR spectrometer and tied to visible to near-infrared spectra measured by the RELAB bidirectional spectrometer [13]. Table I.

Drift = A-5, Crust = A-8. After measuring the dry powder mixtures, water was added to each powder to form a paste which was then dried in a sample dish to create a brick of cohesive, cemented material.  In the samples with greater amounts of MgSO4, some of the sulfate crystallized on top of the brick, forming a thin crust.  However, the bulk bricks underneath their crusts were cohesive by themselves.  Water was also added to the pure palagonite and MgSO4 endmembers and they were dried in the same manner.  The sulfate formed a hard, solid mass while the palagonite was only packed together. Near and mid-infrared spectra were obtained from each brick except for the 2.58% MgSO4 sample.  In addition, the bricks were also measured after the thin upper crust of concentrated sulfate was removed. Results:  Spectra of the pure palagonite and MgSO4 are shown in Fig. 1.  Between 4 and 5 µm and between 7 and 12 µm are sulfate absorptions that are detectable in the powder mixtures.  Band strengths increase with increasing sulfate content and reach 5% in the 4.5 µm region (Fig. 2) for the 18% MgSO4 mixture (11.9% SO3).  Farther in the infrared, band strengths are stronger, with the 9.8 µm band surpassing 15% for the 18% MgSO4 mixture.  The sulfate in these powder mixtures should therefore be detectable on the surface of Mars at the concentrations measured by the Viking Landers. SULFATES ON MARS: SPECTROSCOPIC EVALUATION OF ANALOGS:  C. D. Cooper and J. F. Mustard A number of key differences from the powders are visible when spectra of the cemented bricks are measured.  At wavelengths longer than 8 µm the reflectance is much higher in the cemented samples (Fig. 2).  Between 9 and 12 µm the reflectance grows dramatically, and the wavelength of the Christiansen feature shifts from 8.8 to 8 µm (Fig. 3). Even the brick without any sulfate shows this behavior.  This is likely due to an increased packing and decreased porosity in the samples, e.g. [14].  Peaks corresponding to sulfate features at 8.6 and 15 µm are apparent in the 5% MgSO4 cemented sample. Implications:  Sulfates in the Martian surface material in the quantities detected by the Viking Landers should be detectable with infrared remote sensing. Furthermore, the difference between loose powder and cemented soils is very pronounced and should also be detectable.  Nonetheless, occurrences of cemented or duricrusted soils would need to be regionally extensive to fill the FOV of TES and not have the features diluted by the presence of abundant dunes or mantling dust such as has been observed by MOC [15].
