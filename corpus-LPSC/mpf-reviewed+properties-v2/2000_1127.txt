Chemie, Postfach 3060, D-55020 Mainz, Germany, dreibus@mpch-mainz.mpg.de . Introduction: The APXS (Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer) of the MPF (Mars Pathfinder) mission returned a wealth of information not only of the geochemistry of this particular landing site but also about the global geochemistry of Mars. A refined method of searching for small peaks in the APXS x-ray spectra permitted the determination of phosphorus in soils and rocks at the Mars Pathfinder landing site. Surprisingly, only small differences of the P concentration between soils and rocks were found. The P concentration of about 0.4 % is high and similar to that found in basaltic shergottites. Analyses of the APXS spectra: The X-ray mode of the APXS is sensitive to mayor elements and to many geochemically highly important minor and trace elements including chlorine, chromium, manganese and phosphorus. Due to the limited energy resolution of the used X-ray detector the spectral region around the P peak was evaluated with a special peak fit method (Fig. 1). After a careful calibration of the instrument by using known geostandards in artificial Martian atmosphere (Fig. 2) the P concentrations of soils and rocks were determined. The uncertainty of the P analyses is ca. 10 % as long as the content is well above the detection limit (Fig. 3). However, for spectra with increased background, such as rock A3, and soils A4 and A5, the errors increase up to 40 %. Martian surface chemistry: Data obtained by the MPF APXS yielded a huge compositional difference between soils and rocks at the MPF landing site, while the soils at the landing sites of Viking 1 and 2 and MPF are chemically identical [1]. The Pathfinder rocks are highly fractionated, rich in SiO2 and K2O, but poor in MgO; they corresponds to terrestrial andesite respectively to icelandites [2]. It became evident that crushing the local rocks cannot make the soil, even if weathering and addition of evaporates like sulfates and chlorides are taken into account. The Mainz group proposed that mechanical addition of mafic material very different to the felsic nature of the Pathfinder rocks is an unavoidable necessity [3]. The twocomponent mixing diagram (Fig.1 in [3]) shows that the two end members contribute about equally to the soil mixture, and hence, have to cover the Martian surface as large geological units.

MGS (Mars Global Surveyor) orbiter confirmed the model put forward by the Mainz group [4]. The TES team reported that Mars can be divided in basaltic units covering most of the southern highlands and andesitic units restricted mainly to the northern hemisphere. The soils at Viking and Pathfinder landing sites are in their chemical composition very similar and have high sulfur and chlorine concentrations when compared to the rocks. The good correlation of Mg with S indicates that S is present in the soil as MgSO4 of about 10 %. Carbonates are absent or low in soils and rocks (Fig. 4) with an upper limit of 5 % MgCO3 [3]. In fact, carbonates should not be expected in Martian soil because of the dominance of SO3 as it was emphasized by Wänke and Dreibus [5] and recently explained in more detail by Clark [6]. The observed good correlation of S versus Mg, Si, Cl, K, and Ti for the Pathfinder samples reflects the fact that sulfur poor rocks are partly covered with sulfur rich soils. The absence of a correlation of P versus sulfur in all Pathfinder samples (Fig. 3) indicates no enrichment of P in the rocks compared to soil as it was found for the other analyzed incompatible element potassium. Identical concentrations of P in soils and rocks would be more in accordance with a sedimentary origin of these rocks rather than an igneous origin. However, the solubility of apatite in a melt depends on its SiO2 content [7]. Hence it might be that the solubility limit of apatite confines the P concentration in the SiO2 rich Pathfinder rocks. The similar chemical composition of soils at Chryse, Utopia, and Ares Vallis is a strong indication of good mixing of surface material on a global scale and can be taken as the average composition of the near-surface crust on Mars. The estimated composition of the Martian crust is basaltic and volatile rich. The P value of 0.5 % is very high when compared to terrestrial crustal concentrations of about 0.1 %, but, is consistent with the predicted high P concentration in the Martian mantle as was derived from the data of SNC meteorites [8]. The only exception in the similarity of chemical composition for Viking and Pathfinder soils is potassium for which the investigators of Viking reported an upper limit of 0.12 % K while Pathfinder found four times higher values matching more the gamma-ray data of 0.3 % K from [9]. The K/U ratio of 6000 reported by Surkov et al. [9] is low compared to a value of about 18000 in Martian meteorites. In the Martian environment it is likely that U and Th reside mainly in apatite that dissolves easily in slightly acidified brines [10]. It seems therefore conceivable that U and Th were extracted by aqueous fluids percolating through the surface layers of Mars and after their evaporation became enriched in the soil thus leading to a lower K/U ratio. It is hoped that the GRS (Gamma-Ray Spectrometer) of the 2001 orbiter would substantiate this hypothesis. References: [1] Rieder R et al. (1997) Science 178, 1771. [2] McSween Jr. H. Y.
