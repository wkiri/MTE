 MARTIAN WAVE STRUCTURES AND THEIR RELATION TO MARS' SHAPE, HIGHLANDLOWLAND CHEMICAL DICHOTOMY AND UNDULATING ATMOSPHERE CAUSING SERIOUS PROBLEMS TO LANDING SPACECRAFTS.  G. G.

This three-word sentence (not yet adequately estimated by the majority of planetologists!) is based on cosmic observations of the last 40 years. Numerous images of planets, satellites and asteroids allow to conclude that orbiting frequencies have a direct relation to the tectonic granulation of celestial bodies [ 1 ]. Due to elliptical keplerian orbits causing standing inertia-gravity waves in celestial bodies spheres they (spheres) acquire wave-woven granular structures. The higher orbiting frequency - the smaller tectonic granulation[1]. This law was tested  in sequences of planets, in sequences of Galilean satellites, and in cases of Titan, Proteus, the Moon, Phobos. Satellites present a special case because they have two orbits (two frequencies) in the Solar system. Thus, their granulation is determined by this two main frequencies and by the modulated frequencies (division or multiplication of the higher frequency by the lower one) [ 2 ]. The scale giving a relation between frequency and granula size is Earth occurring in the "golden-middle" of the Solar system. The  Earth's granula is  R/4 (R- a planet radius) corresponding to the frequency 1/1 year. A "necklace" of such 8 intermittent (+ or -) granulas is well studied at the equatorial zone where the most pronounced  are Congolese (+), Indian (-), Indinesian (+) superstructures.[3 ]. Mars having orbiting frequency twice as lower as Earth must develop larger superstructures ( R/2) and this is exactly that is observed at Mars. If 8 terrestrial granulas  (4 standing waves in the great circle) more or less evenly deform the planetary body, 4 martian granulas (2 standing waves, wave 2) make  its body  squeeze in one direction  and extend in the perpendicular one. This makes the martian body elliptical (it concerns also both its satellites) that is clearly observed in shape of its areoid. As the atmosphere is a subject  to the same wave warping one observes  two symmetric bulges separated by two hollows in all atmospheric layers  (for an example, [4 ]).      An amplitude of the wave warping according to the wavelength is lower at Earth and higher at Mars. This has very significant consequences  for the martian lithosphere and atmosphere. In the weak martian atmosphere comparatively dense wide bulges (+) abruptly alternate with almost empty  (without supporting air) wide hollows (-). If a parachuting probe gets into "+" it descends well, but if it touches "-" it falls abruptly and crushes.  That is why ~ a half of the martian spacecrafts ( 12 out of 22) are failed [ 5].      The lithospheric petrological (chemical) dichotomy of Earth is demonstrated as opposition of dense tholeiites (oceanic floors) and less dense andesites (an average continental crust). This density difference (about 0, 25 g/cm3 ) is  needed to level  angular momenta of uplifted continental blocks and subsided oceanic ones occurring in one rotating planetary body (otherwise it will tend to disintegrate). At Mars with higher relief range (the wave amplitude) this leveling  requires the higher density difference. "Oceanic" floors are filled with dense Fe-tholeiites (denser than the Earth's tholeiites), opposing them high continents must be constructed with lithologies  less dense than  andesites (andesite-like rocks are discovered by "Pathfinder" in the contact highland-lowland). The gravity map of Mars [ 6 ] shows a  little difference between lowlands and highlands. This means that the highlands are really composed of light, not dense rocks. We supposed [7 ] that the highland lithologies are akin granites, syenites, albitites (Si and Fe distributions at Mars' surface do not contradict to this supposition). But these rocks at Earth are often rich in chlorium. We suggested Cl as a test to the notion of light continents of Mars [ 8 ]. Now it seems that this test is positive. Now, when the light martian highlands are backed by gravity, albedo and chemistry, one may state that Mars is a highly fractionated body (before "Pathfinder" the majority of planetologists believed that it is mainly basaltic).      So, the wave planetology has an important predictive force. Starting from Earth as a scale, one arrives to structures of planets (not only Mars), satellites [9 ], asteroids (convexo-concave shape - wave 1, diamond-shape - wave 2 [10 ]) and Sun - a star. According to an orbiting frequency of the solar photosphere the Sun's supergranulation is  R/60 (that is why its supergranula size is 30-40 thousand km across[11]). This is in line with asteroids - R/1, Mars - R/2, Earth - R/4, Venus - R/6, Mercury - R/16. Thus, the  laws of the wave planetology extend from asteroids to aster embracing several fields of astronomy.
