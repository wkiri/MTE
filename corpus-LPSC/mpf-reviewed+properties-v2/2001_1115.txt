Introduction:  Rocks on Mars are objects of prime scientific interest to a landed spacecraft, but also represent an obvious hazard to landing and an impediment to rover travel. Although MOC images are of high enough resolution to distinguish the largest rocks (an extremely small population several meters diameter or larger), traditionally the abundance and distribution of rocks on Mars have been inferred from thermal inertia and radar measurements [1], our meager ground truth sampling of landing sites [1, 2], and terrestrial rock populations [3]. In this abstract, we explore the effective thermal inertia of rocks and rock populations, interpret the results in terms of abundances and populations of potentially hazardous rocks, and conclude with interpretations of rock hazards on the Martian surface and in extremely high thermal inertia areas. Effective Thermal Inertia of Rocks: Spectral differencing of thermal measurements of Mars have been used to derive the rock component of a two component surface for an assumed effective thermal inertia of rocks [4]. These estimates typically assume an effective thermal inertia of about 1250 (SI units or J m-2 s-0.5 K-1) for rocks of diameter 0.1-0.15 m [5]. In a review of thermal inertia data versus particle size, Jakosky [6], found that rocks greater than 0.2 m in diameter should have an effective thermal inertia approaching 2500, whereas particles of 0.001 to 0.03 m size should have effective thermal inertias of about 400. To derive the effective inertia of a rock population we applied a simple empirical model of effective inertia versus rock diameter that is consistent with these estimates. This model, assumes that rocks with diameters greater than 0.26 m have inertias of 2100, rocks with diameters 0.01-0.03 m have inertias of 400 and rocks in between have inertias that vary as the 0.75 power of their diameter [2]. The effective inertia for the entire rock population is calculated by summing the products of the thermal inertias and areas for each rock and dividing by the total area covered by all the rocks. This calculation is thus most sensitive to the shape of the cumulative fractional area versus diameter distribution of rocks and not the total area covered (which is normalized out). For the cumulative fractional area of rock versus diameter distributions reported in Golombek and Rapp [3], this parameter is the exponential factor, q(k) in the equation: Fk(D) = k exp [-q(k) D], where Fk(D) is the cumulative fractional area covered by rocks of diameter D or larger, k is the total area covered by all rocks, and q(k), which governs how abruptly the area covered by rocks drops off at large diameter. Effective Thermal Inertia of Rock Populations: Applying this equation to rock distributions on Mars and Earth analog sites shows that the total effective rock inertia typically covers a narrow range of 1700-2100. For measured rock distributions at the three landing sites, the total effective thermal inertia of the rock populations are 1700 for Pathfinder and 1900 for the Viking sites (without outcrops Viking 1 yields 1700). Most Earth analog sites reported in Golombek and Rapp [3] show a similar total effective thermal inertia of 1700-2100 for the measured rock distributions. The cumulative fractional effective rock inertia versus diameter plots generally mimic the cumulative fractional area versus diameter plots and are consistent with simple exponential functions in which the pre-exponential factor is the effective inertia of the entire rock population, and the exponential factor controls the decrease with increasing diameter. Rock size-frequency distributions with gradual drop off in cumulative area with large diameter (such as the Ephrata Fan distributions), similarly show relatively flat cumulative fractional effective inertia versus diameter plots in which the cumulative fractional inertia of rocks greater than 0.26 m in diameter is 90% of the total. The other extreme is found in rock distributions with abrupt decrease in cumulative fractional area with increasing diameter such as Mars Hill in Death Valley or the Goldstone basalt surfaces in the Mojave Desert [3], in which less than half the cumulative fractional effective inertia is produced by rocks of diameter greater than 0.26 m. If q(k) is less than about 4, the total effective inertia of the rock population will be ≥1700. For example, the 5% model rock distribution in Golombek & Rapp [3] has a total effective rock inertia of about 1250 for a q(k) of almost 5. Potentially Hazardous Rocks:  The effective inertia of rocks versus diameter equation shows that only rocks with effective inertias of 2100-2500 can be considered potentially hazardous as they correspond to rocks with diameters 0.26 m in diameter or greater. Rocks potentially hazardous to the Mars Exploration Rover landers are those greater than 0.5 m high [2] or those with diameters of 1 m or greater [3]. Note that the sizefrequency distributions of rocks measured at the three landing sites have <1% area covered by rocks greater than 1 m diameter [2, 3], even though these sites are among the rockiest on the planet [4]. For a rock population with a total effective inertia of 1700-2500, as opposed to the 1250 assumed in [4], less area would be covered by rocks [5] for a given bulk inertia. Conversely, any surface materials whose effective thermal  EFFECTIVE ROCK INERTIA AND LANDING HAZARDS:  M. P. Golombek et al. inertia is less than 2500, should not be considered potentially hazardous. Rock Abundance for Different Effective Rock Inertias:  To address the change in inferred rock abundance (total area covered by a population of rocks) for different effective rock thermal inertias, a simple thermal model of the bulk inertia of the surface was solved for different rock inertia, rock abundance, and fine component inertia. Rock component thermal inertias of 1300, 1700, 2100, and 2500 were evaluated with a suite of fine component thermal inertias from 77 to 542. For each combination of rock and fine component thermal inertias, we calculated the surface temperature at 5AM local Mars time for the two materials (rock and fines) using a standard thermal model [7] and determined the corresponding black-body spectral emission at these temperatures. For a range of rock abundances (0-50%), we then mixed the corresponding spectral emissions and calculated the resulting 20 µm temperature (using an IRTM equivalent response function). Finally we derived the bulk thermal inertia from the 20 µm temperature using the algorithm of Mellon et al. [7]. (Throughout these calculations we assumed a surface albedo of 0.25, a infrared dust opacity of 0.1, and an atmospheric pressure of 6 mb). This yields a plot of bulk thermal inertia versus rock abundance for different effective rock inertias along lines of constant fine component thermal inertia (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows that for changes in effective rock inertia from 1300 to 2500 for any given fine component thermal inertia, the total change in rock abundance for any given bulk inertia is about 20%, which is the uncertainty typically reported for these estimates [1, 4]. The difference in rock abundance for rocks with effective inertias of 1300 versus 2500, should roughly correspond to the difference in relative area covered by rocks with diameters of 0.15 m versus 0.26 m, respectively. As a check for consistency, the difference in area covered by rocks of diameter 0.15 m and 0.26 m for the three landing sites is similarly between 10% and 20% of the total rock abundance. Thermal Inertia and Landing Hazards on Mars: Figure 1 also encompasses most of the trade space possible for surfaces on Mars for different combinations of bulk and fine component thermal inertias for different rock abundances and effective rock inertias. For reference, all three of the landing sites fall in a zone of 260440 bulk inertia, 15-20% rock abundance, and resulting fine component thermal inertia of roughly 200 to 340 (with Pathfinder the highest and Viking 2 the lowest). All of these surfaces are considered safe for the Pathfinder landing system [2, 3]. Given our present state of knowledge, we can infer that most areas with <20% rock abundance (among the rockiest 90% of the planet [4]) and fine component thermal inertia greater than 1300 to 1700 should be acceptable for the Pathfinder landing system [3]. Figure 1 and the discussion herein also allow us to evaluate the potential hazards of extremely high thermal inertia areas on Mars. Mellon et al. [7] report surfaces with Thermal Emission Spectrometer derived bulk thermal inertias that exceed 800 SI units. Landing sites being considered for the Mars Exploration Rovers in Valles Marineris have bulk inertias this high. These surfaces must have high fine component thermal inertias of 650800, given that rock abundance does not exceed ~3035%. Surfaces with fine component thermal inertias this high have generally been interpreted as being duricrust or some other cemented or cohesive surface [1, 7]. Given our previous discussion that argues only materials with effective inertias greater than about 2500 SI units be considered hazardous, none of these surfaces should be considered especially hazardous a priori, without other information. 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Bu lk I ne rt ia ( SI u nit s) Rock Abundance Figure 1.

Solid lines are for an effective rock inertia of 1300; dashed lines are for effective rock inertias of 2500. Intermediate values of effective rock inertia (e.g., 1700, and 2100 SI units) fall in between these two for each group of fine component thermal inertia values. Fine component thermal inertia values of 77, 114, 168, 249, 367, and 542 are shown and can be distinguished by where these curves intersect the ordinate or the line of zero rock abundance.
