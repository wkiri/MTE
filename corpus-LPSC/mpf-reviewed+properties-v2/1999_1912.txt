Background: To construct the history of the Sagan Memorial Station (SMS) site requires gaining an understanding of the mineralogy of the local rocks and soils. The Imager for Mars Pathfinder camera included filters designed to reveal the spectral features of the landing site at wavelengths from ~440 to 1000 nm [1]. Preliminary analyses of the composition of local rocks and soils [e.g. 2,3], has provided information to test hypotheses of site geologic history. SMS lies in Chryse Planitia, at the debouchment of Ares and Tiu/Simud Valles. Based upon the SE-NW alignment of streamlined islands near the channel mouth, Ares Vallis has been considered a source of flood deposition at the site [4]. The SE-NW imbrication of rocks in the Rock Garden is also consistent with an Ares Vallis flood source. However, many of the island tails at the western edge of the Ares Vallis mouth are truncated in the direction of the Tiu/Simud Valles flow [5], suggesting that this younger catastrophic flood also contributed deposits to the SMS site [6]. In this work we use multispectral analysis of rock and soil mineralogy to test the hypothesis that the SMS site contains debris from separate flood events originating from both Ares and Tiu/Simud Valles. Method:  We have analyzed images surrounding Mini-Matterhorn (MM) as a sample region. Because these images represent a highly diverse scene, they are suited to demonstrate the wide geologic variation of the site. Images in each filter were calibrated [7] and a correction was made for illumination by the sky. Images were then registered to each other and stacked to create two hypercubes yielding information in the left (8 filters) and right (7 filters) camera eyes. The initial calibration relative to the targets [7, 8] has been improved for this study. Absolute reflectance uncertainty has been reduced to <10% by accounting for differences between target and scene illumination, and band-to-band uncertainties have been reduced to <3% by accounting for variations in target photometric properties at different viewing geometries. Discrepancies between the two eyes due to differences in the geometry of each eye with respect to the target have been reduced as well. Because of unresolved correction factors between spectra from left and right eye only the right eye is treated here. In order to highlight potential geologic variations, both individual filters and ratios were examined. For example, the ratio of the 752/967 nm filters distinguishes variations around the 1000 nm Fe2+ (mafic) absorption band feature, while the 752/443 nm ratio highlights differences in slope attributable to the variations in local maxima of ferric oxide and oxyhydroxide minerals [1]. In addition, point spectra were taken to identify the detailed spectral signature of geologic features as well as any anomalous features. Finally, firstorder classification of spectra was made based upon variations revealed by these results. General Setting and Mineralogy:  The MM scene covers ~4 m2 of the imaged landing site. It contains one large rock (MM) and several small rocks which display an angular, pitted texture. Several small cobbles and numerous pebbles are also scattered apparently randomly throughout the scene. Dust covers a large portion of the rock and cobble faces. The local soil around the lander is disturbed by movement of the airbags. At 671 nm rocks and cobbles appear darker than the surrounding soil. Rocks range from ~ 4 to 16% reflectance and average ~7-12% reflectance, while the soil averages ~18%. At 752/967 nm the inverse is true — rocks commonly appear brighter than soil. We interpret this difference to be attributable to an Fe2+ (mafic) absorption band that manifests itself more strongly in the rocks than in unconsolidated soil. To a first order, unburied cobbles and pebbles have a very similar ratio signal to the larger rocks. Any differences in mineralogy are not detectable using this method. Spectral Samples & Classification:  In order to determine the spectral features common to key geologic features, several single pixel (point) spectral samples were taken from rocks, cobbles and soil regions. These are shown in Figure 1. Spectra were also taken of several anomalous regions noted in ratio images. The registration process is accurate in this scene to ~1/4 pixel; thus spectral information taken from each pixel is an accurate representation of the reflectance for that pixel. Error bars on these spectra are around 1-2% band-to-band reflectance. Two groups of spectra are seen in Figure 1. The first is characterized by a low reflectance and relatively flat  slope from 443 to 752 nm. There is a small decrease in reflectance at longer wavelengths, possibly suggesting a 1000 nm mafic absorption band. This signature is associated with the angular, pitted rocks in the scene and is similar to that previously identified as typical of relatively unweathered, angular rocks ("Dark Rocks"  or DR [9]). We therefore interpret this spectral type to be analagous to DR [9],  representing the most dust-free, well-illuminated rock faces. There were no clear subdivisions of rock mineralogy noted in these spectra. However, spectral variations of <2-3% reflectance were seen from rock to rock; these may resolve into separate mineralogies as analysis progresses. The second group has a higher overall reflectance and steeper 443-752 nm slope. No downturn at 1000 nm is visible, but the curvature flattens around 443 nm. This SPECTRA OF MINI-MATTERHORN:  R. A. Yingst et al. spectral shape is interpreted to typify local soil and mantling products on the rocks. Indeed, although spectra of mantling dust are lower in overall reflectance, their shape is easily discernible when compared to rock spectra. Thus, although dust is pervasive at the SMS, there is a first-order separation of rocks from dust. Spectra from three cobbles, referred to here as Abu, Gerbil and Peesh, are different from those of other rocks in the scene. Abu and Peesh have spectra characterized by a steep slope from 443-752 nm, a lower reflectance than soil and a downturn around 1000 nm typical of rock spectra. This signature is similar to that of "Bright Rocks" (BR) — rocks with a greater dust coating or weathering [9]. We interpret these results to represent local BR, which retain their downturn at longer wavelengths but are more strongly affected at shorter wavelengths by greater mantles of dust. Areas of Abu and Gerbil have spectra similar in reflectance and shape to typical rock spectra except at shorter wavelengths, where a distinct upturn is noted at 443 nm. An error in calibration is an unlikely explanation for these anomalous spectra since the signature is not systematic. In addition, the upturn is not mirrored in any soil or dust spectra observed, so dust is not a major factor. It is possible that these spectra represent a unique variation in rock mineralogy. Specifically, the flattening of the spectra at 530 nm, especially in Abu, may be indicative of the 530 nm shoulder of the absorption band associated with iron oxides. Thus, although Abu and Gerbil are generally similar to Bright and Dark Rocks respectively, portions of the rocks have a composition whose current best interpretation is a hematite-like iron oxide. Discussion:  Two general rock types are revealed by analysis of the MM scene, similar in spectral signature to the Dark and Bright Rocks analyzed at other locations [9]. This implies that these two rock groupings have either a different mineralogy or a different geologic history. Since both channel networks derive from similar geologic units [10], and all rocks sampled by the APXS can plausibly be traced back to a similar sulfur-free rock composition [3], it is likely that differences in rock reflectivity are due to variations in deposition or erosion history. Assuming that rock weathering occurs primarily through fluvial activity, the two rock groups could then represent two catastrophic outflow events, where Ares Vallis is represented by rocks with the more weathered spectra of BR and the younger Tiu/Simud event is represented by the unweathered DR spectra. Alternately, the two groups could represent a period of outflow activity (BR, where variations in spectral signature indicate possible separate flood events) and subsequent emplacement of unweathered, angular crater ejecta (DR). The presence of several cobbles in this scene showing unique spectral signals, currently best interpreted as representing a hematite-like iron oxide, implies that some rocks at the SMS site have a different petrologic or evolutional history. We are continuing examination of the rocks and soils of this and other scenes through the methods enumerated here in order to more clearly determine the fine-scale mineralogy of the SMS region.
