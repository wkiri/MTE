 EROSION RATES AT THE MARS PATHFINDER LANDING SITE AND CLIMATE CHANGE ON MARS.  M. P. Golombek (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech, Pasadena, CA 91109). Introduction: The observation that the Mars Pathfinder landing site looks very similar to when it was deposited by catastrophic floods some 3.5-1.8 Ga [1, 2] allows quantitative constraints to be placed on the rate of change at the landing site since that time. When combined with interpretations of data recently returned by the Mars Pathfinder and Global Surveyor missions and perspectives drawn from 20 years of analysis and interpretation of the Viking data, these observations and inferences suggest an early warmer and wetter environment with vastly different erosion rates and a major climatic change on Mars. Landing Site: Remote sensing data generally at a scale greater than ~1 km and an Earth analog correctly predicted a rocky plain safe for landing and roving with a variety of rocks deposited by catastrophic floods [1]. The surface is composed of subangular to subrounded pebbles, cobbles, and boulders and generally resembles from the ground, depositional surfaces produced by terrestrial catastrophic floods, such as the Ephrata Fan in the Channeled Scabland of Washington State [1]. From the lander, the Twin Peaks look like streamlined islands, consistent with interpretations of Viking Orbiter images of the region, and the lander appears to be on the flank of a broad, gentle ridge, interpreted to be a debris tail trending northeast from Twin Peaks. Rocks in the Rock Garden may be imbricated or inclined blocks generally tilted in the direction of flow [2]. Troughs visible throughout the scene may be primary features produced by the flood or they may result from the late-stage drainage of water after deposition, which preferentially carried away the fines, leaving a blocky armored surface behind (analogous to channels and surfaces present on the Ephrata Fan) [1]. This general similarity to analogous surfaces on Earth as suggested in orbiter remote sensing data argue that the site has undergone minor alteration [3] since it formed in Late Hesperian/Early Amazonian time [4] (estimated to be 3.5-1.8 Ga, [5]). Aeolian Features and Environment: The abundance of erosional features such as an exhumed former soil horizon, sculpted wind tails, duneforms and other ripplelike lag deposits, and ventifacts all suggest the site has undergone net deflation or loss of material [2, 6]. A 5-7 cm thick redder band along the base of several rocks appears to be a former soil horizon that has been deflated or exhumed. The sculpted shape of numerous wind tails behind rocks and pebbles also suggests they are predominantly erosional as opposed to the bulbous shape expected of wind tails formed by deposition [6]. Ripplelike features at the site and at least some of the dunes, such as Mermaid Dune, appear to be composed of poorly sorted material beneath an armoring veneer of dark gray granules in rover trenches, and are thus interpreted to be lag deposits [7] indicative of net erosion or deflation of the landing site. The presence of ventifacts, or fluted and grooved rocks also argues for erosion by saltating crystalline sand-size particles entrained in the wind [8]. All of these features suggest that the landing area has been dominantly scoured by the winds and thus is a zone of net deflation or erosion and removal of surface fines. In contrast, aeolian depositional features at the Pathfinder site are limited to a few duneforms, including a barcan-shaped feature imaged by the rover that strongly argues for formation by saltating sandsize grains [6]. The immaturity of the ventifacts and their different wind orientation from other aeolian features has led to the suggestion that the duneforms may have formed early when the supply of sand-size particles was greater [8]. The small number of these duneforms, which are up to 15 cm high, suggests that they may be the result of redistribution of predominantly locally derived sand-size material. Deflation Rates: The depth of deflation at the site can be used to calculate the deflation rates since the surface formed some 3.5-1.8 Ga, which provides an estimate of the efficiency of erosional processes on Mars in Amazonian time. The 5-7 cm thick deflated soil horizon and the <15 cm thick wind tails suggest extremely low (0.01-0.08 nm/yr) deflation rates. The observation of small crater rim heights being similar to those expected for fresh Martian craters places similar, albeit less precise constraints on erosion rates at the Pathfinder landing site. Big and Little craters in view of the lander have rim heights of 40 m and 5.2 m, respectively, which are similar to the expected heights (56 m and 6 m) for fresh Martian craters with diameters of 1.5 km and 0.15 km [9]. The differences between the measured and expected heights of these craters are not statistically distinct, given the measured dispersion of fresh crater rim heights [9], so there may have been no erosion of their rims. If the craters are not significantly younger than the surface, this limits erosion at the Pathfinder site to <1 nm/yr, which is the same result determined from crater rim heights at the Viking 1 landing site [10]. Higher erosion rates are permissible if the craters are much younger than the surface, but are not argued for by the freshness of the craters. These observations and calculations severely limit the erosion or deflation of materials at the Pathfinder and Viking 1 landing sites EROSION RATES ON MARS:  M. P. Golombek to <1 nm/yr and more likely <0.1 nm/yr or mm/Ma or m/Ga in the past 3.5-1.8 Ga at the Pathfinder site and suggests that a cold and dry environment, similar to today's, has prevailed since that time. Early Warmer/Wetter Environment: In contrast to the desiccating environment of today, a variety of observations by Pathfinder support an earlier climate that was warmer and wetter. Rounded pebbles and cobbles [7], evidence for abundant sand-size particles [6], and possible conglomerates [7] observed at the Pathfinder landing site suggest an early fluvial environment that was warmer and wetter than today with liquid water in equilibrium with the environment. Airborne dust particles collected by the Pathfinder magnetic targets further support this hypothesis [11]. The particles are composite silicates with a highly magnetic mineral interpreted to be maghemite that may have freeze dried as a stain or cement from liquid water that previously leached iron from crustal materials in an active hydrologic cycle. The presence of sand-size particles at the landing site, where none appear in lower-resolution Viking images, may suggest an abundance of sand-size particles on Mars, which appears consistent with recent Mars Orbiter Camera high-resolution images returned by Mars Global Surveyor [12]. Sand on Earth typically forms via fluvial processes that mechanically break down rocks into smaller fragments, which may be another indicator of a warmer and wetter past. The suggestion that the early Martian environment was warmer and wetter is not new [e.g., 13]. Valley networks (at least one of which, Nanedi Vallis, has a central fluvial channel formed by running water in high resolution MOC images) and associated dry lake beds [13], possible strand lines, beaches and terraces inferring a northern ocean [14], and rimless, degraded craters in ancient heavily cratered terrain [15, 16] have all been described in Viking Orbiter images and used to argue for a warmer and wetter past in which liquid water was stable with the environment. Erosion rates calculated from changes in Noachian age crater number and shape are 3-5 orders of magnitude higher (0.1-10 µm/yr) [15, 17] than those calculated for more recent times (comparable to alpine and periglacial environments on Earth). Martian Surface Layer: Our knowledge of the Martian surface layer developed from remote sensing observations, image analysis and observations at the three landing sites agrees with the very slow erosion rates described above and suggest that since the Hesperian a surface layer of order meters to up to several tens of meters thick has been redistributed around Mars [18]. This layer likely consists of sand and dust size particles that are entrained and moved by the wind [19]. Dust can be deposited and removed at much greater rates over short time periods. For example, deposition of dust on Pathfinder's solar panels during the 3 month mission has been estimated at roughly 20 µm/yr [20], which cannot represent long term averages as such rates would result in meters thick accumulations of dust within a comparatively short span of a million years. Other areas may be net sinks for this material such as areas like Amazonis Planitia, whose thermal inertia, radar and imaging properties suggest an area with meters thick accumulations of dust [18] or the north polar erg, a large region of sand dunes surrounding the polar cap [19]. Other areas such as the Pathfinder landing site appear to have been swept clean or even deflated. These short term rates of deposition and removal and longer term redistribution rates in Late Hesperian and Amazonian time are of order m/Ma, comparable in magnitude to erosion rates in the Noachian. Climate Change: Constraints on when the suggested climate change occurred are not tightly bound due to the uncertainties in the proposed crater density time scales [e.g., 5]. All three landers are on units of Early Amazonian to Middle Hesperian age and thus document the present day dry, desiccating environment since 3.1-3.7 Ga. Valley Networks appear to be dominantly Noachian in age [13], which places them at >3.5-3.8 Ga. The impact degradation of many valley networks further suggests that they may have formed at the tail end of heavy bombardment around 3.9 Ga [21]. References:  [1] Golombek M. P. et al.
