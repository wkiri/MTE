 THE 4.5 µm  SULFATE ABSORPTION FEATURE ON MARS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO FORMATION ENVIRONENT.  D. L. Blaney,  Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, MS183-501, Pasadena, CA 91009, Diana.L.Blaney@jpl.nasa.gov   Introduction:  Sulfur was detected at roughly 4-9 wt% SO3 in the Martian soil at both Viking landing sites and the Pathfinder landing site [e.g. 1,2].  The oxidation state of the surface and the concentration of sulfur in clods at the Viking Landing sites were interpreted as a sulfate duracrust. Blaney and McCord (1995) [3] showed  that rise out of the 4.2 µm - 4.4 µm CO2 band on Mars cannot be matched solely by atmospheric gas constituents.  An absorption feature must be added at roughly 4.5 µm in order to decrease the reflectance and produce the 4.5 µm inflection present in the data.  The location of this feature at the 2ν3 overtone of the SO4 -2 anion indicated that the absorption is probably caused by sulfates on the Martian surface and/or in atmospheric dust. An exact match to a terrestrial sulfate mineral was not made but it was suggested that the mineral has very weak structure and thus a high degree of symmetry.     Figure 1.  Spectra from Blaney and McCord 1995 with atmospheric models showing 4.5 µm feature.     Improved Modeling of Spectra: Additional modeling of the Blaney and McCord spectra [4] (Figure 1) shows that significant variation exists between the spectra at 4.5 µm. All of the spectra however, show indications of a sulfate absorption.  Table 1 shows the model parameters used to match the spectra in figure 1.   Table 1.

However, except at 4.5 the models do a good job matching the shape of the spectra.  These models show that the variability seen in these spectra (at ~500 km spatial resolution) is not solely due to differences in dust opacity in the atmosphere or surface temperature effects.  They are consistent with the idea that sulfates are common on Mars but have variable concentrations.  Figure 2.  Sulfate mineral spectra are compared to the telescopic spectra of the Valles Marineris Region between 4.5 and 5.2 µm normalized  to 1.0 at 5.0 µm.  The atmospheric model for the Vales spectra is shown as a dotted line.  Spectra are offset from each other by 0.4.   SULFATES ON MARS:  D. L. BLANEY  Comparison with Sulfate Mineralogy:  The improved atmospheric modeling permits a more direct comparison of the Mars spectra to terrestrial sulfate minerals.  Figures 2 and 3 compare three sulfates: gypsum, anhydrite, and reagent grade MgSO4 with the spectra from theValles Marineris region.   As can be seen in Figure 2, while a feature is clearly present at 4.5 µm, there are not the expected features of comparable strength at longer wavelengths.  Additionally (Figure 3), the details of the band center and shape at 4.5 µm are not consistent with these sulfate minerals.  Figure 3.  Blowup of the 4.5 µm region showing Mars spectra with the continuum removed and the details of sulfate mineral structure.  The continuum removed spectra show variation in band depth with location.  Spectra are normalized and offset for ease of viewing.     The multiband structure seen in the sulfate spectra is produced by the metal cation complexing with the SO4 -2  and lowering the symmetry of the sulfate.  The lower symmetry causes degeneracy in the n3 and n4 modes, and the appearance of the n1 and n2 modes that are not infrared active under the tetrahedral symmetry that the  SO4 -2 anion. Thus this absorption band is very sensitive to both changes in cation (compare MgSO4 and anhydrite) and hydration state (compare gypsum and anhydrite). Hydrous Magnesium Sulfates--A New Possibility:  Recent work by Cooper and Mustard [5], looking at duracrust formation, found that evaporating a solution of MgSO4 can produce a sulfate duracrust that does not have any fine structure in it's 4.5 µm absorption feature.   A quantitative comparison between the laboratory spectra and the telescopic data has not yet been undertaken.  However, the identification of a sulfate phase with the right general spectral characteristics produced in a processes analogous to what may be happening on Mars offers an exciting new avenue of exploration.    Sulfate Minerals and Formation Environment:  The sulfates associated with duracrust formation are probably not a strong indicator of sites of astrobiological interest.  However, these sulfates are probably very soluble in water since they are easily cemented into a duracrust.  Therefore, regions of recent ground water activity may actually have the sulfates leached out of them.  Additionally, the fine structure of the 4.5 µm sulfate anion is very sensitive to mineralogy.  Given the abundance of sulfate in the near surface, the precipitation of sulfate minerals in ground water systems is very likely.  Sulfate mineralogy in hydrothermal systems and dried lakebeds would probably produce more highly crystalline minerals (such as gypsum or anhydrite) than seen in the duracrust based on comparison with terrestrial systems.  Mapping sulfates in this wavelength region thus offers high potential in locating aqueous sites on Mars.  References:  [1] Clark et al., J. Geophys.
