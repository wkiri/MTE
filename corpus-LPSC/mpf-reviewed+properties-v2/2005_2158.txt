Introduction: Dust devils are columnar convective vortices made visible by the presence of dust or other particulates. They occur most often in environments characterized by low ambient wind speeds and strong unstable lapse rates [1]. There is increasing evidence that vertical vortices in the terrestrial convective boundary layer may occur frequently without the presence of visible tracers and  therefore be much more common than previously thought [2]. The ubiquity of dust devil tracks in certain regions on Mars suggest that they are a regular feature of the Martian boundary layer [3]. The implications of dust devils on vertical transports of heat, momentum, and particulates may be significant.  In addition, they could pose some threat to landers and rovers, or spacecraft upon descent and landing.   This study presents results from an idealized Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the Martian Boundary Layer (MBL). Comparisons are made with prior Martian dust devil modeling study results, in which different numerical models were used [4,5] and with observations. Methodology: A simple three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic, super-compressible, numerical model, called KANSAS (KANak's System for Atmospheric Simulation), is used to simulate the Martian boundary layer [2,6]. The first-order Smagorinsky turbulence closure is used to represent SGS turbulent diffusion. The equations are cast on a Cartesian Arakawa Cgrid and prognostic variables are integrated using a second-order, quadratic-conserving spatial discretization scheme, and the centered-in-time leapfrog temporal scheme with Asselin filter. Lateral boundary conditions are periodic, and, the vertical boundary conditions are rigid. A Rayleigh damping layer is used at the top rigid boundary. At the lower boundary, surface stresses and surface heat flux are parameterized using a bulk aerodynamic formula. No parameterization for radiative effects is included.  Also, the representation of dust is not included in the model.  To simulate low wind conditions, no imposed background winds, wind shears, or other sources of ambient angular momentum were included in this LES. The LES employed 150 x 150 x 60 grid points. The horizontal grid spacing was x = y = 40 m. The vertical grid spacing was stretched from 40 m near the surface to 295 m at the top of the domain. The simulation domain was 6 x 6 x 10 km.  The initial potential temperature profile was specified as constant up to 3500 km and increased at 0.003 K m -1 above that. A surface pressure of 699 Pa and a surface potential temperature of 242 K were assumed. The prescribed initial disturbance condition was characterized by random perturbations in the potential temperature and vertical velocity fields. A constant heat flux of 1.65 K m s -1 was designated at the lower boundary, which corresponds to a sensible heat flux of about 21 W m -2 .  Results: Figure 1 is an XY cross-section of the vertical velocity, w, at z = 21 m (one half grid spacing above the surface). The simulated MBL is characterized by a coherent cellular convective pattern that is qualitatively similar to that of terrestrial simulations [2,6] and similar to that presented by [4,5]. The pattern has narrow regions of strong updrafts and broad regions of weaker downdrafts at this height. At the vertices of the cellular pattern are local maxima in vertical velocity and these are often favored locations for vertical vortices. However, [4,6] showed that vortices embedded within the convective updraft zones can also be identified.  The associated horizontal velocity vectors, vh  at every other grid point are shown in Fig. 2.  The structure of the pattern indicates that MBL winds could be from almost any direction depending upon location within the cellular pattern. There are wind gusts (11.3 m s -1 ) and local wind shears that could have implications for descent and landing of spacecraft.  There is an cyclonic vortex, denoted by the black box in Figs. 1 and 2, located at (x,y) = (1060 m, 2140 m) near the intersection of the convective updraft branches. The region is expanded and shown in Fig. 3 with shaded contours of , and  vh  at every grid point. The maximum value of  is 0.18 s -1 . The cyclonic vortex is straddled by regions of anticyclonic vorticity. There is a second smaller cyclonic vortex to the left of the main vortex that was not clearly evident from Fig. 2. The central pressure drop associated with the main vortex is 1.2 Pa, and the potential temperature increase is 7.6 K. The vortex is embedded within rising motion, but has a central downdraft as in [1]. Prior modeling studies [4,5] exhibited horizontal wind speeds of 9-10 m s -1 , pressure deficits of 1-2 Pa, temperature increases of 2 K, and vertical vorticity values of 0.06-0.3 s -1 associated with dust devil-like  circulations. Mars Pathfinder [7] recorded a pressure drop of 2.8 Pa, and a temperature change of 0.2 K believed to be associated with dust devil passage.    Figure 1. XY cross-section of w contours at z = 21 m and t=2000 s.  Max. value is 2.3 m s -1 , min. value is 2.6 m s -1 , and the contour interval is 0.35 m s -1 .  Figure 2.  vh  at z = 21 m and t = 2000 s.    Figure 3. XY cross-section of  contours (color shading) and  vh  (in white) at z =21 m and t =2000 s. Max. value of  is 0.18 s -1 , min. value is -0.07 s -1 and the contour interval is 0.018 s -1 .    Figure 4. YZ cross-section of  contours at x = 1060 m and t = 2000 s. Max value is 0.18 s -1 , min value is 0.1 s -1 and the contour interval is 0.02 s -1 .   Figure 4 shows a YZ cross-section through the center of the main cyclonic vortex.  Again, the anticyclonic flanks of the vortex are evident. The vorticity column extends to z = 500-600 m.  This height is less than the observed heights, 2-8 km, of Martian dust devils [8] but is consistent with the results of [4]. The width of the vorticity center is about 400 m and this is very close to observed values [8]. But dust devil tracks on Mars indicate that the width is highly variable.  In addition, the width of the vorticity column may not be equivalent to the actual width of a dust devil column. Summary: 1.) Coherent cellular structure is exhibited; 2.) Dust devil-like vortices compare favorably with results from prior modeling studies and dust devil observations; and 3.) Comparison of these results using a different numerical model than those used in [4,5] shows that the existence of Martian dust devil-like vertical vortices does not depend on background winds, radiative effects, diurnal heating variations, or on the details surface layer parameterizations.
