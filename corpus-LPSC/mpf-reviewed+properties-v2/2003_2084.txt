 TEN-METER SCALE TOPOGRAPHY AND ROUGHNESS OF MARS EXPLORATION ROVERS LANDING SITES AND MARTIAN POLAR REGIONS. Anton B. Ivanov, MS168-414, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech, Pasadena, CA, 91109, USA, anton.ivanov@jpl.nasa.gov. Introduction The Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) has been operating on board of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft since 1998. It consists of three cameras - Red and Blue Wide Angle cameras (FOV=140 deg.) and Narrow Angle camera (FOV=0.44 deg.). The Wide Angle camera allows surface resolution down to 230 m/pixel and the Narrow Angle camera - down to 1.5 m/pixel. This work is a continuation of the project, which we have reported previously [2]. Since then we have refined and improved our stereo correlation algorithm and have processed many more stereo pairs. We will discuss results of our stereo pair analysis located in the Mars Exploration rovers (MER) landing sites and address feasibility of recovering topography from stereo pairs (especially in the polar regions), taken during MGS ''Relay-16'' mode. Method The basis for stereo image processing described in this work are the image correlation tools developed as a part of the VICAR (Video Image Communication And Retrieval) software suite at the Multimission Image Processing Laboratory (MIPL) at JPL. VICAR has been developed since 1966 to digitally process multi-dimensional imaging data. We employed VICAR tools used for geometric rectification (GEOMV) and automatic tiepoint matching (program TRACKER3) with a properly calibrated camera model (SPICE I-kernel, [3]) for MOC Wide and Narrow angle cameras instrument. The basis for robust recovery of tiepoints from two images is the Gruen correlation algorithm [1], which has been implemented in VICAR [5]. TRACKER3 routine provides the most useful interface for the feature tracking and automatic tiepoint identification for stereo processing. This program takes two images as input and automatically finds all tiepoints in the images with accuracy down to about 0.2 of a pixel. The tiepoints can be used for either referencing target image to the reference image, or for detecting change between time separated image sequence. Recovery of topography information from stereo pairs followed standard processing scheme : 1. Perform radiometric calibration of the images (using ISIS tools for MOC processing) 2. Perform rectification of the images (project into the same reference frame) using the best known camera model. Pointing knowledge is very important at this step. 3. Use TRACKER3 routine for to automatically obtain tiepoints from both images. 4. Use XOVER subroutine for all tiepoints to obtain location of intersecting rays projected from the camera. Data analysis We have presented topography calculated using MOC Red Wide Angle camera in [2], where we have proved validity of the proposed algorithm and in this work we concentrate on the Narrow angle camera imaging. In the MGS Extended mission phase MOC has targeted numerous sites for off-nadir imaging by its narrow-angle camera. First set of data considered here consists of images taken during specific targeted observations (''ROTO maneuvers'' ) for MER landing site observations. The second group of images comes from the south polar region of Mars, taken while MGS spacecraft was in the ''Relay-16'' mode. MER landing sites Over the course of Mapping and Extended phases of the MGS mission MOC camera has been targeted to take stereo images of selected landing sites. Landing site targets included Viking Landers, Mars Polar Lander, Pathfinder and future candidate sites for Mars Exploration Rovers (MER). The best stereo pairs were obtained during the Extended mission, when MGS spacecraft was pointed off-nadir to obtain high quality stereo pairs. Here we present an example stereo pair (E02-00665 / E03-01453) results. This stereo pair is of very high quality and illustrates common problems that we have encountered. We have collected more than 1 million tiepoints on two images. Fig. 1 shows the actual image E02-01453 and shaded relief map, constructed from the retrieved topography. All topographic features can be clearly identified in shaded relief map. However, there are some small scale undulations in the image, which are believed to be due to very small scale oscillations of the spacecraft. The cause of these oscillations is unknown, but one of the possible explanations is the wobble of the solar panels. We are currently developing algorithms to remove this noise. This will enable us to analyze roughness of landing sites at 10m horizontal scale and compare with 300m horizontal scale MOLA topography. These results are consistent with analysis of the same stereo pair performed by Kirk et. al [4]. South polar region During the extended mission phase the MGS spacecraft has endured so called ''Relay-16'' mode in order to save fuel and prolong operations in Martian orbit. The spacecraft is pointed 16◦ off the nadir orientation. Consequently, all MOC images taken during this period of time have approximately 18◦ emission angle. Although, this angle is smaller than the optimal separation angle for stereo, we decided to study feasibility of reconstructing topography from this set of images. The results of stereo processing are shown in Fig.2. This quality of stereo pair is very high and noise is minimal. Note that the same effects due to wobbling of the spacecraft are very well pronounced. Summary We have employed new stereo image processing capabilities developed for the VICAR image processing system. Ten-meter scale topography, that is derived from Narrow An TEN-METER SCALE TOPOGRAPHY OF MER LANDING SITES AND SOUTH POLAR REGION. gle stereo pairs, is consistent with the MOLA topography. Detailed analysis of the Narrow Angle images revealed previously unknown oscillations of the spacecraft. Narrow Angle processing results are consistent with the results obtained by Kirk et al.[4]. We are currently working on algorithms to remove spacecraft noise and analyze surface roughness. Work is currently underway to analyze more stereo pairs as more data is being released and also introduce THEMIS visual subsystem images into our processing. Data resulting from the stereo pair analysis will be of high value for investigations of small scale topographic structures on Mars and future landing sites selection process.

Figure 2: Original MOC Narrow angle image M10/01422, reconstructed shaded relief map and comparison with the MOLA data. This DEM is located on the south polar residual ice cap. Thick line and blue dots are same as Fig. 1 for stereo pair (M10/01422 - E09/01101). This DEM is of very high quality and only lacks data in the areas with no contrast, where the image matcher was not able to �nd good correlation. Note pronounced "waves" introduced by the wobbling of the spacecraft. References [1] GRUEN, A., AND BALTSAVIAS, E. Adaptive least squares correlation with geometrical constraints.
