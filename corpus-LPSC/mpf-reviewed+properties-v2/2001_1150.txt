Papike, Institute of Meteoritics, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131. Introduction: Oxygen fugacity estimates for the basaltic martian meteorites have been presented previously [1, 2]. As noted in [1], oxygen fugacity correlates with geochemical parameters, including Sr and Nd isotopic composition, La/Yb (or La/Sm [3]) ratios, and oxygen isotopic composition. Here we focus on the implications of these correlations for the oxidation state of the martian mantle, controls on oxygen fugacity, and implications for the petrogenesis of martian basalts. Oxygen fugacity of Dar al Gani 476: Calculation of oxygen fugacity for Dar al Gani 476 (DaG) from pairs of Fe-Ti oxides is problematic, as noted by [2]. Oxide compositions deviate significantly from the ideal Fe-Ti endmembers for which oxygen barometers were developed (e.g. QUIlF [4], Ghiorso-Sack [5]).  Ilmenite-spinel pairs are rare, and the ilmenite phase is usually small and intergrown with the spinel phase. The presence of olivine, low-Ca pyroxene and Crrich spinel in DaG 476 enables calculation of oxygen fugacity using the model of [6]. Five spatially associated groups were analyzed by electron microprobe. Temperatures were calculated using the olivinechromite thermometer of [7], and magnetite activities for spinel were calculated using the MELTS supplemental calculator [7,8]. This resulted in an average (n=5) oxygen fugacity of 2.3 log units below the QFM buffer [9] with a standard deviation of 0.4 log units. Estimates from orthopyroxene and chromite in the cores of olivine phenocrysts are within error of estimates from groundmass assemblages. Oxygen fugacity and geochemical parameters: Oxygen fugacity decreases with εNd values (Fig. 1), and increases with initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios (Fig. 2), La/Yb ratios (Fig. 3) and δ18O (not shown). Studies of Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic systematics have suggested that mixing between mantle (having low initial 87Sr/86Sr and high εNd) and crustal (or �crust-like�; having high initial Sr and low εNd) reservoirs may explain the extreme variability in radiogenic isotopic composition of the martian meteorites [10, 11]. The correlations presented here demonstrate that the crust-like reservoir is more oxidized, more LREE-enriched and has heavier δ18O than the mantle-like reservoir (which we assume to be the upper mantle). Implications for martian mantle oxidation state: The observation that the most reduced martian basalt (QUE 94201) is also the most mantle-like in terms of Sr and Nd, indicates that the martian upper mantle is probably reduced. As QUE 94201 may contain some crust-like component, it represents a maximum oxygen fugacity for the upper mantle (QFM - 3). Implications for controls on the oxygen fugacity of martian basalts: The oxygen fugacity of terrestrial basalts is controlled primarily by inheritance from the source region [12] and to a certain extent by fractional crystallization [13]. In the case of the martian basalts, correlations with Sr and Nd indicate that the primary control on oxygen fugacity is through a source mixing process like assimilation.  Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic systematics of the shergottites have been interpreted to reflect interaction between martian mantle and crustal reservoirs through AFC [11]. The exact relationships between the martian basalts are unknown. Los Angeles, Shergotty, Zagami and EETA 79001 have ages around 180 Ma, suggesting that they are derived from the same location on Mars [14]. Among the 180-Ma basalts, the weak correlation between Mg� of melt and oxygen fugacity suggests that these may be related to each other in a magmatic differentiation suite, i.e. through AFC processes. QUE 94201 has an age of 330 Ma [15], and DaG is 474 Ma old [16]. These have the largest 142Nd anomalies [15, 17], indicating that they are likely to be representative of martian mantle isotopic compositions. Therefore, although QUE 94201 cannot serve as the parent for the 180-Ma basalts, it appears to have the appropriate isotopic composition for the mantle component in the 180-Ma basalts (figure 2). Assimilation models: Despite the complexities in the relationships between the martian basalts, the general trends observed in terms of oxygen fugacity, geochemistry and petrology are indicative of interaction with an oxidant in the martian crust, likely through assimilation. Possible oxidants. The consistently basaltic compositions of the martian basalts precludes assimilation of significant amounts of more evolved (e.g. andesitic or granitic) material. However, assimilation of Mars Pathfinder Sulfur-free rock [18], essentially a basaltic andesite, may explain the observed correlations if the rock is sufficiently oxidized. Assimilation of 10% of this rock with ferric iron content adjusted for an oxygen fugacity of QFM + 7 will oxidize QUE 94201 without significant changes in bulk composition. Likewise, assimilation of altered basaltic material, such as Lafayette iddingsite, which formed around the HM  Oxygen fugacity and martian basalt petrogenesis:  C.D.K. Herd, L.E. Borg and J.J. Papike buffer [19] (= QFM + 6) will produce the observed 2 log unit difference between QUE 94201 and Shergotty, as well as the ~ 1� increase in δ18O. However, although these models are attractive, they fail to adequately explain how incompatible-element enrichments can occur while maintaining a basaltic bulk composition. Recent work has focussed on the possibility of hydrous parental magmas for some of the martian meteorites [20, 21]. This raises the possibility that the parental magmas have interacted with amphibole-bearing rocks. Amphibole can have a range of compositions, including those approximating basalts, it readily takes up incompatible elements, and can fractionate Rb from Sr. It shows no preference for ferric or ferrous iron, and thus preserves the Fe3+/ΣFe of the melt [22]. The melting point of amphibole is less than that of dry basalt, and more oxidized amphibole melts at a lower temperature [23]. Therefore, assimilation of oxidized amphibole by reduced, dry, mantle-derived basalts may explain the observed correlations between oxygen fugacity and geochemical parameters. Conclusions: There are correlations between oxygen fugacity of the martian basalts and certain geochemical parameters such as Sr, Nd and O isotopic composition and La/Yb. These are indicative of assimilation of oxidized material by reduced, mantlederived basalts. Although the available data on these meteorites does not allow for firm constraints to be placed on the exact nature of the oxidizing material (or its exact location), the general trends support the model of a reduced, depleted mantle and an oxidized, enriched crust, as well as a model in which water may play an important role.
