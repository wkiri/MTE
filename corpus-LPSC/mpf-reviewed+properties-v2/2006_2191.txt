Direct identifications of sulfate minerals have been made by Mössbauer experiments [4] and by OMEGA [5-7]. Abundant water-equivalent-hydrogen (WEH) has been detected over two large equatorial regions (including the landing sites of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers) using the neutron spectrometer component of the gamma-ray spectrometer suite on the Mars Odyssey orbiter. This WEH is assumed to reside mainly in hydrated minerals [8]. The WEH is abundant around Gusev crater (~7.5 wt% over a 600 km footprint) and is much higher than the water content (~ 3 wt%) estimated for the most sulfate-rich (~22 wt% sulfates) subsurface regolith within The Boroughs trench [9] assuming kieserite (MgSO4.H2O) to be the stable phase and hydration state of Mg-sulfate. Kieserite has been identified by OMEGA at many locations on Mars [3]. The relative humidity (RH) at the regolith surface in equatorial regions on Mars can vary from ~ 0% during the day to ~ 100% in early morning as a result of large temperature excursions (≥100K) during the diurnal cycle. Under such conditions, more than one hydration state of the Mg-sulfates may be stable.  It is therefore crucial to develop instrumentation capable of distinguishing among the various hydrated phases of the Mgsulfates so that we may develop an understanding of their stability fields and determine the pathways of phase transformation between the phases.  Experiments:, The starting materials were crystalline, reagent grade (98+% pure) β-MgSO4, kieserite and epsomite having grain sizes ≤150 µm. Five types of experimental procedures were used to produce the various hydrated Mg-sulfates. The humidity buffer method [10] was used to study the stability fields and the pathway in de-/re-hydration reactions as a function of RH at fixed temperature; Raman measurements were made with the samples in sealed, glass reaction vials; X-ray diffraction was used to verify phase structure (measurements were conducted with the XRD powder sample holder tightly sealed within an amorphous polymer wrap), and weight changes were monitored during de-/re-hydration. Raman spectra of magnesium sulfates: Raman spectra of ten Mg-sulfate (aqueous solution, 8 different MgSO4 .xH2O's, and β-MgSO4) were obtained in this study. They were found to have unique, characteristic spectral patterns that can be used for the identification of the individual phases. Figure 1 shows that the water bands in 2500-4000 ∆cm-1 spectral region of the different phases have reproducible variations in details of the band structure, arising from the distinct crystallographic sites of water molecules in the structures. The vibrational modes in the fundamental region of the Raman spectrum (100 to 1300 ∆cm-1) are collectively affected by variations in the linkages between SO4 tetrahedra and MgOn(OH2)6-n octahedra, as well as by the hydrogen bonding between the water molecules and the oxygen in SO4 groups. The fundamental symmetric stretching vibration ν1 of the SO4 group at 980-1050 cm -1 also Figure 1. Raman spectra of the hydrates of magnesium sulfate.  shows a general increase in peak position with decrease in degree of hydration of the Mg sulfates, which were then used to identify the components in samples containing mixtures of hydrated Mg-sulfates.  These unique Raman spectral patterns permit positive identification of the individual hydrates of the Mg sulfates. De- and Re-Hydration Pathways: The Raman spectral features discussed above, especially the systematic ν1 peak position shift, were then used to study the pathways of de- and re-hydration of Mg-sulfates as a function of T and RH.  We employed two starting materials pertinent to the martian environment in these experiments -- kieserite and epsomite. We followed their changes in states of hydration at both 21 ºC and 50 ºC as a function of RH. Table 1 summarizes the results of this study. The final equilibrated species at different T and RH conditions were found to be dependent upon of the starting phase, kieserite or epsomite.  For example at 21 ºC or 50 ºC, the hydration of kieserite proceeds directly to hexahydrite. Hexahydrite is the final phase at 50 ºC, but at 21 ºC and higher RH's, epsomite also begins to form.  The pathway for the dehydration of epsomite is distinctly different. The hexahydrite is the first phase to be formed at all RH's. After ~600 hrs. exposure @ 21 ºC, starkeyite finally appears, but only at 10% RH.  At 50 ºC, however, the dehydration of epsomite proceeds more rapidly, going first to hexahydrite, with starkeyite appearing just after 24 hrs of exposure at the lower RH's. After ~800 hours of exposure, starkeyite is the stable phase at a RHs ≤ ~50%, and hexahydrite is the final phase at RHs ≥~50%.  No hydrates containing 1.25, 2, 3, or 5 moles of water or any amorphous phase were encountered during this study. The data in Table 1 show in general that: (1) the phase changes began almost immediately (within 24 hrs.); (2) final phase equilibria were reached (if at all) only after hundreds of hours at fixed RHs; and (3) phase changes occurred more slowly at the lower temperature.  Conclusion: The temperatures at the surface of Mars are generally much lower than those used in our experiments, and the length of the martian diurnal cycle is much shorter [12] than the time needed for the hydrated phase of the Mg sulfate to reach equilibrium with the ambient water vapor. We would thus expect that the hydrates of the Mg sulfates would never reach equilibrium with water vapor during the diurnal changes of the RH occurring at the surface of Mars.  Most important, the Raman spectroscopic study of the hydrated Mg sulfates described here shows that Raman spectroscopy, and in particular, the microbeam Laser Raman spectrometer (e.g., MMRS), would be an extremely powerful tool for the in situ characterization all of the hydrated phases of the magnesium sulfates.
