 CRUSTAL HEAT PRODUCTION AND THE THERMAL EVOLUTION OF MARS.  Scott M. McLennan, Department of Geosciences, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, 11794-2100, USA (Scott.McLennan@sunysb.edu). Introduction:  The thermal evolution of single plate planets, such as Mars, may be strongly governed by mantle convection that takes place within a "stagnant lid" convection regime [1].  Within such a regime, heat transport from the mantle is inefficient compared to the plate tectonic regime, and accordingly mantle temperatures are likely to rise well above the solidus temperature throughout much of the history of the planet, resulting in widespread catastrophic melting, for which there is no clear evidence.  Two possible explanations to this dilemma are that plate tectonics operated early in the history of Mars [e.g., 1,2] or that there was a transfer of a substantial amount of heat producing elements into an early Martian crust [e.g., 1,3]. Here it is shown that several lines of geochemical evidence support the suggestion that the Martian crust is enriched in large ion lithophile elements (and thus the heat producing elements, K, Th, and U).  Coupled with well established isotopic evidence for early segregation of enriched crust and depleted mantle reservoirs, this evidence lends support to the suggestion that the thermal evolution of Mars was influenced by the separation of heat producing elements into the Martian crust, early in the planet's history. Composition of the Martian Crust:  The use of sedimentary material to estimate the composition of the upper continental crust is well established on Earth [4].  It also has been suggested that the fine-grained soils and dust on Mars may be used similarly to estimate the upper crustal composition on Mars [e.g., Ref. 5].  On Earth, there is significant differentiation within the continental crust such that the upper and lower crusts differ in composition [4], however, on Mars, where basaltic volcanism dominates, such intracrustal processes may be less severe.  Thus, at least to a first order, the average surficial composition of Mars may be a reasonable estimate of the overall bulk crustal composition. The similarity between Martian soil compositions, at Viking and Pathfinder sites, and basaltic shergottites has long been recognized and has given weight to the suggestion that the Martian crust is basaltic in average composition [6].  Viking soil results suggested K2O abundances below the detection limits of about 1500 ppm [6].  However, the Pathfinder results are in stark contrast to this with K2O abundances on the order of 6,000 ppm on average, and Pathfinder rocks have even higher potassium levels [7,8]. Orbital gamma-ray spectra (GRS) from both the Mars-5 and Phobos-2 missions also indicate enrichments of incompatible elements in Martian surface rocks [9-11].  The most complete data set is that of Surkov et al. [11], who reported Phobos-2 results for 10 overlapping "footprints" from equatorial regions. Each of these regions had K2O levels between about 3,500 ppm and 7,000 ppm, and Th and U abundances averaging about 2 ppm and 0.6 ppm, respectively. Although there are large uncertainties in the gammaray major element compositions, the range of the Phobos-2 data show general similarities with both the Pathfinder soils and basaltic shergottites. Figure 1 summarizes the K-Th relationships for the various Martian compositions.  The K-U relationships (not shown) show essentially identical trends and together the available data support the LIL element (and heat producing element) enriched nature of the Martian crust. The Martian crust, on average, may have a chemical composition similar to an LIL-enriched basalt, perhaps analogous to hotspot-related basaltic volcanism on Earth. 100 1000 10000 K(ppm) 0.1 1 10 Th (ppm) Primitive Mantle Mars-5 GRS Phobos-2 GRS SNC-Basalt.

Note that samples representative of large regions of the Mars surface (soils, orbital GRS) all indicate K abundances greater than 1,000 ppm and mostly greater than 4,000 ppm.  The GRS data suggest significantly lower K/Th (and K/U) ratios than do SNC meteorites but for modeling presented here, the higher, more conservative SNC K/Th and K/U ratios are adopted. Timing of Crust-Mantle Differentiation:  The magmatic history of SNC meteorites, and thus their radiogenic isotope systematics, are complex.  Nevertheless, there is widespread evidence, from essentially all of the radiogenic isotope systems that have been  CRUSTAL AND THERMAL EVOLUTION OF MARS:  S. M. McLennan examined (e.g., Sm-Nd, U-Th-Pb, Rb-Sr, Lu-Hf, HfW) that the Martian mantle was strongly differentiated early in its history [e.g., 17 - 24].  Blichert-Toft et al. [23] recently argued that this differentiation process included separation into LIL-enriched crustal and LILdepleted mantle reservoirs.   Although the exact age (or age range) of this process is model dependent, it is of great antiquity and an age approaching 4.5 Ga has been suggested [e.g., 18, 19, 21, 23]. Discussion:  On Earth, the continental crust, averaging about 40 km thick and covering about 40% of the surface, comprises less than 0.5% of the mass of the planet.  If the oceanic crust is included, the terrestrial crust averages only about 20-22 km in thickness. Mars is a much smaller planet and consequently, a crust of comparable thickness involves a greater fraction of the mass of the planet.  Thus, even though the level of LIL-enrichment proposed for the Martian crust is about a factor of two less than that of the weighted mean of terrestrial continental and oceanic crust, the efficiency by which the Martian crust sequesters radiogenic heat production, as a function of crustal thickness, is comparable to, or even greater than, the terrestrial crust (Fig. 2).

Plot of the amount of the planet's radiogenic heat production that is sequestered into the crust, as a function of crustal thickness.  For the Earth, the present day relative distribution of oceanic and continental crust is used, with compositions from Taylor and McLennan [4, 25].  The Mars primitive mantle is taken from Dreibus and Wänke [15] and the crustal abundance model assumes K/U=20,000 and K/Th=5,600, the same as for the primitive mantle, and SNC meteorites (see Fig. 1).  A depth of 1760 km is assumed for the core/mantle boundary on Mars. The thickness of the Martian crust is not well established, with various estimates ranging from about 10 km to >100 km.  The most recent independent estimate, based on Mars Global Surveyor gravity and topographic data suggest a minimum average thickness of 50 km [26].  There is no constraint on what fraction of the crust is composed of a geochemically "enriched" component. Essentially all models of terrestrial crust-mantle evolution predict that between about 25% and 50% of the heat producing elements reside in the crust, mainly the continental crust [e.g., Ref. 4].  On the Earth, most crustal growth took place during the Archean and early Proterozoic and so the transfer of heat from mantle to crust probably took place mostly over a somewhat extended period of time from about 4.5 Ga to about 2.0 Ga [4].  On the other hand, crust-mantle differentiation on Mars may have been very early and could have resulted in greater than 50% (and potentially up to nearly 100%) of the heat producing elements being transferred to the crust.  Such an early and large scale transfer of heat production to the crust would have had a significant influence on the thermal evolution of the planet [1] and may well explain the lack of widespread catastrophic mantle melting during the history of Mars.
