THE USE OF MULTIPLE HYPOTHESES TO DETERMINE CHARACTERISTICS OF MARTIAN SURFICIAL UNITS:  EXAMPLE, O XIA PALUS QUADRANGLE. M.A. Presley (Dept. of Geology, Box 871404 Arizona State University, Tempe AZ  85287-1404 mpresley @asu.edu) Overview:  The region of western Arabia Terra, which has also been referred to as "Oxia" [1, 2], is enigmatic.  Intermediate in albedo and thermal inertia, relative to "bright" and "dark" units, and significantly different in "color", this unit does not fit into simple "sand-covered" or "dustcovered" categories.  In this work I present multiple hypotheses that fit the observed albedo and thermal data for this region.  Through the examination of other data sets, primarily those from Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), the number of viable hypotheses is expected to shrink.  In this manner, the utility of multiple data sets for the remote determination of the character of even complex regions will be demonstrated. Background:  The central equatorial region of Mars has long been of interest to investigators [1-6], due to the considerable variation in color, albedo, and thermal properties over a relatively small area of the planet.  Its position within the preliminary location parameters for the 2001 Lander further adds to the intrigue of this area.  This region includes the southwestern area of Arabia, the regions of Sinus Sabaeus, Sinus Meridiani, and Deucalionis Regio [1, 2]. A minimum of three surficial units can readily be distinguished in Viking Orbiter color and albedo images (see Plate 15 in [7]).  One unit appears reddish, has a relatively high spectral contrast, and is relatively bright.  Primarily located in the east and northeast, this unit corresponds to most of the region of Arabia Terra.  In the south, it appears to also correspond with Deucalionis Regio (DR), although Merenyi et al. [1] contend that DR is more closely related to western Arabia Terra, and should even be counted as a separate unit.  The average thermal inertia of the "bright" unit is 130 J/m2s1/2K [2], which corresponds to a particle size of 8 µm [8].  Observations of atmospheric dust by Toon et al . [9] are consistent with particles that are 1-10 µm in diameter, although Haberle and Jakosky [10] argue that dust in the atmosphere is even smaller than that.  The inferred particle size is consistent with the interpretation that this unit is composed primarily of windblown dust, potentially far from its origin [2-4]. The second unit appears dark blue in spectrally enhanced images, although its real color properties are merely less red; i.e., it possesses a lower spectral contrast than the other units. Primarily located in the south to southwest, this unit corresponds to Sinus Meridiani and Sinus Sabaeus as well as dark splotches in large craters within the Oxia Palus quadrangle, and dark streaks associated with those splotches.  The average thermal inertia of this unit is 240 J/m2s1/2K [2], which corresponds to a particle size of 500 µm [8].  This unit is interpreted to be a deposit composed of sand-sized particles, which move primarily by saltation.  Especially strong winds may periodically entrain them.  This deposit, while mobile, would not be as widely transported as dust.  Yet, the limited mobility of the unit would explain the formation of smallscale features, such as the dark streaks and splotches within craters.  Edgett and Christensen [11] argue that martian dunes are most likely to be formed by medium to coarse sand, i.e., particle sizes from 300 µm to 2000 µm.  Indeed, dunes are visible in many of the crater splotches in the Oxia Palus Quadrangle [12].  These features could be the remnants of a more pervasive deposit of "dark" material.  The higher thermal inertias typically found in the dark splotches [13] support the idea that these are lag deposits. The third unit is dominant in western Arabia Terra, and appears intermediate in color and albedo to the other two units.  Merényi et al. [1] contend that Deucalionis Regio makes a better "end-member" unit, in which case western Arabia Terra is shown to consist of 50% of Deucalionia Regio type material.  As viewed through the Viking red and blue filters, this third unit has a low blue albedo, like the second, dark unit.  However, the third unit also has a relatively high red albedo, although not quite as high as the first, bright unit.  In a red to violet histogram, mixing trends exist between the bright unit and the third unit, and the bright unit and the dark unit [2].  These mixing trends imply that the bright unit is mobile, which is consistent with it being composed primarily of dust.  The mixing trends also imply that the dark unit and the third unit are both relatively immobile, since there is no mixing trend between the two color/albedo units.  This implication is consistent with the sharp albedo boundaries between the two units, and is consistent with the dark unit being composed primarily of sand-sized particles, which, although mobile, would tend to move in sheets, and not mix intimately with adjoining units. The idea that western Arabia Terra is a relatively immobile unit is in apparent conflict with the determined particle size.  The average thermal inertia of the third unit is 200 J/m2s1/2K [2], which corresponds to a particle size of 90 µm [8].  Iversen and White [14] demonstrated that, on Mars, 115 µm is the optimum particle size for entrainment by wind.  90 µm is sufficiently close to the minimum threshold that the particles comprising western Arabia Terra ought to form a relatively mobile deposit. Approach:  This apparent conflict suggests that the use of albedo and thermal data alone to characterize the physical properties of surficial units is not sufficient.  In this case, I present multiple hypotheses that appear to fit the data and suggestions on how each of the hypotheses can be evaluated. The goal is to determine which one(s) best describe the character of the unit comprising western Arabia Terra. Proposed Multiple Hypotheses: A Salt Crust  [2-4, 6].  Previous investigators proposed that a chemical cement would immobilize the deposit.  Such crusts have been observed at both Viking Lander sites [15, 16], and the Mars Pathfinder landing site [17].  MGS Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) data should be able to detect salts down to 2-8% concentrations, depending on the physical properties of the materials [18].  When MGS obtains its mapping orbit, spectra of the area will be examined for the OXIA:  MULTIPLE HYPOTHESES  M.A. Presley presence of salts, whether the salts are more concentrated in western Arabia Terra (and Deucalionis Regio), and whether the salts could account for the difference in color. Hematite Formation [6].  In a variant of the salt crust hypothesis, Mustard [6] suggests that the crust may include immature materials that break up, mature, and form hematite upon impact of saltating sand particles from the dark unit. This interpretation would explain the ribbon of bright material that appear to separate the dark materials the third unit. If the third unit is simply indurated bright material, however, a chemical reaction is not be necessary.  MGS TES data will be used to determine the mineralogical differences between the bright unit and the third unit. An Exhumed Deposit [19].  Another possibility is that the third unit represents an exhumed unit and may consist of particles much smaller than 90 µm, but compacted to a higher density, and subsequently possessing a higher particle to particle cohesion.  This explanation is consistent with the presence of well-defined scarps, yardangs, and etched areas located primarily in western Arabia Terra [5].  The general lack of correlation between unit boundaries and morphology, however, casts doubt on this suggestion.  MGS images will have higher resolution than those available from Viking. When they are released, they will be examined for more subtle morphologic changes at the unit boundaries.  Laboratory thermal conductivity studies, if funded, would illuminate the discussion by allowing determination of the combination of particle size and amount of compaction that would be necessary to produce the observed thermal inertia. A Lag Deposit [1].  Another possible scenario is that the surface is armored by particles larger than sand, but finer than 10 cm.  Lag deposits, where the armor of coarse particles, or small stones, comprise a layer only one or two grains thick over a soil composed of finer grains have been observed in desert environments on Earth [20].  The top, coarse layer may form through sorting of the materials by wind, which would remove the finer sized particles through saltation and impact-induced suspension [21].  In order to achieve an effective thermal inertia of 200 J/m2s1/2K, the underlying layer is expected to consist of very fine particles.  Merényi et al. [1] suggest << 50 µm.  A thermal model, similar to that of Ditteon [22], has been developed that can examine subsurface layering.  Several layering scenarios, consistent with lag deposits, will be investigated by the time of the LPSC conference, in order to assess the feasibility of mimicking the effective thermal conductivity of the region with such a lag deposit. Fine Sand [19].  Finally, there is the possibility that Oxia is simply a region composed primarily of find-sand-sized particles, ≤ 90 µm.  Unlike the bright dust which can stay in the atmosphere for extended periods of time, the brown particles may fall out much more rapidly and mixing of the unit would take place primarily at the unit margins.  The sharp boundaries could be maintained, if the dark unit kept itself free of Oxia materials through saltation in much the same way as other dark features are observed to clean themselves of dust deposits at the conclusion of dust storms [23].  Such material would still be expected to form small scale dunes or other wave forms.  None were observed in Viking images, but higher resolution MGS images might show such formations.
