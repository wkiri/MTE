Background. Much of the sedimentary transport and depositional history of Mars may be recorded in the morphologic characteristics of the individual rocks or particles that make up its sedimentary clast population (defined as a rock fragment or grain resulting from the breakdown of larger rocks or bedrock). Measuring morphology is crucial; it retains the best record of sorting and abrasive effects [1, 2]. Because it can be determined to a high degree of accuracy by relatively simple and objective means, morphology is also a property that may be studied quantitatively and statistically, using indices calculated from clast geometry. This quantifiability is important, as a scheme of measuring  and expressing numerically the morphology of a clast is necessary for descriptive purposes and for discriminating between the several factors involved in the evolution of clast shape. Approach. Assessment of clast morphology is a standard analysis technique (e.g. [3-8]). On Earth, the method is often used at sites where the overall recent geologic history is constrained (a glacial environment, for example), but the number of clast populations and the general transport mechanism represented by each — such as fluvial vs. marine vs. intertidal vs. terrestrial — is not  (e.g. [9-12]). This mirrors the situation for Mars, where the primary processes of various localities have yet to be identified. Previously we reported on the results of an assessment of size, sphericity, elongation and roundness for rocks within the Mars Pathfinder Rock Garden [13, 14]. Here we compare these results to similar indices for the Viking 1 and 2 landing sites. Method. The rocks at the MPF site have been classified by roundness, flatness/tabularity or angularity (e.g. [15-17]). Similarly, quantitative indices appropriate for rocks in this investigation include size, sphericity (how closely rock shape resembles a sphere), roundness (how sharp the corners of a rock are) and elongation (a measure of major to minor axis length). Rock size was derived from previously published work [18, 19]. Elongation was calculated by dividing the minor by the major axis of each rock [20], while sphericity was estimated by taking the outline of each individual rock and determining the largest inscribed and smallest circumscribed circle of the resulting polygon. These values yielded sphericity by using ρ = Dins/Dcir, where Dins is the largest inscribed circle and Dcir is the smallest circumscribed circle [21]. Roundness was determined by measuring the angle of the smallest corner of the rock outline, calculating the associated radius and using P = 2r/A, where A is the major axis length and r is the radius of the smallest corner [21]. A database of rock characteristics was created based on these calculations [14]. Comparison to other martian sites. In terrestrial studies, "standard" populations for which the transport processes are well understood are compared with clast characteristics for which the geologic history is not known (see for example [9-11]). In the case of the MPF Rock Garden, the ideal situation would be the existence of case studies to which MPF data could be directly compared. However, available terrestrial case studies do not provide appropriate comparisons, because the conditions under which such clast measurements have been made differ from those for this study in terms of resolution, easy availability of three-dimensional data and the ability to perform analysis on samples in the lab. However, we have available data for elongation and roundness values for other martian sites, those of Viking 1 and Viking 2 [22]. We compare these values with those calculated for MPF.  Elongation. [22] examined rocks from 16-256 mm in average diameter at both Viking sites. The rocks were digitally outlined based upon the twodimensional images available, and the major (L) and minor (W) axes of each outline were measured. The data was then used to calculate the least projection elongation (referred to in [22] as two-dimensional sphericity) by using W/L.  The resulting average elongations were determined to be 0.634 and 0.631 for Viking 1 and Viking 2 rocks respectively.  Since [22] limited their study to rocks 16-256 mm in diameter, the sample of clasts from [14] was descoped to include only clasts within the 20-250 mm range (pebble to cobble-sized [23]). For this subset, elongation for MPF Rock Garden clasts had a mean value of 0.640 and a median value of 0.636. This similarity in elongation values across sites indicate that all pebbles/cobbles have become elongated to the same degree at MPF, Viking 1 and Viking 2. This is consistent with the conclusion that rocks at these sites have a similar lithology [24].  It is important to note, however, that for MPF, very little clustering of elongations was observed. Most values ranged from 0.32-0.9. The standard deviation for this group was 0.22; 68% of the  elongation values span a large range from 0.42-0.86. Thus, it is not clear how representative the mean elongation value is for comparative purposes. However, the data is consistent with an interpretation of basaltic lithology predominating among the clasts in the Rock Garden, similar to Viking 1 and 2. Relative roundness. Though quantitative roundness data is not readily available for other sites on Mars, qualitative roundness statistics do exist for both Viking landing sites [22]. Roundness was determined in [22] by comparison of rocks with standard charts created by [2, 6, 7]; these are comparable to those produced by [6, 7, 25] used for qualitative roundness assessment for MPF rocks in [14]. In total, a subset of 595 clasts was analyzed at MPF, compared to 240 at Viking 1 and 210 at Viking 2 [22]. A comparison of qualitative roundness as a percentage of clasts measured for each site is graphically shown in Figure 1.    When taken together, rocks with low rounding (classified as very angular, angular and sub-angular) comprise the bulk of rocks at all three sites (48%, 64% and 76% of measured clasts at MPF, Viking 1, and Viking 2 respectively). Average roundness is sub-angular in all three cases as well. MPF clasts from this study have the highest average rounding; sub-rounded and rounded rocks make up 34% of the population, compared to 32% and 20% for Viking 1 and Viking 2 respectively. This result is consistent with the conclusion that the majority of rocks from these three sites are more likely to be impact derived, while a smaller population has been altered primarily by another process that rounds clasts more effectively. Most of the rocks at Viking 1 likely represent ejecta from local impact craters, though flood detritus from Maja Valles is also possible [26]. Viking 2 rocks are also most likely derived form impact, either with a local (secondaries) or regional (Mie Crater) origin ([26] and references therein). One interpretation of the qualitative roundness data is that the population of rounded and sub-rounded rocks at MPF were altered primarily through transport in the Ares/Tiu Valles floods, and that the similarity in roundness with a smaller population of rounded to sub-rounded rocks at Viking 1 occurs because a significant number of rocks from the latter site derive from the Maja Valles catastrophic flood. No discrete class of rounded to sub-rounded rocks appears to exist at Viking 2.  We note, however, that a percentage (19%) of MPF rocks are classed as "indeterminate" in qualitative roundness; they were too small for the structural and textural clues that allow roundness to be assessed visually. These rocks are not considered in these comparisons. Since this is a significant fraction of the total number of clasts, any conclusions regarding the implications of these comparisons should be considered first-order, pending availability of comparable quantitative roundness statistics for Vikings 1 and 2.
