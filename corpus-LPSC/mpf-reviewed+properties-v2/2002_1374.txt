Phyllosilicates of special interest to Mars scientists are those produced from water-related processes on Mars, such as clay minerals. No positive mineralogical identification of phyllosilicates was reported from previous landings (Viking or Pathfinder) or orbiter missions to Mars (e.g., the Mars Global Surveyor, perhaps because of inadequate spatial resolution). Finding and characterizing phyllosillicates will be a major task for the MER '03 and later missions. A Mars Microbeam Raman Spectrometer (MMRS) has been under development [1]. It has targeted in situ mineral characterization during a Mars surface exploration. How well can a Raman spectroscopic technique identify and characterize phyllosilicates? There are few reports in literature on Raman spectra of phyllosilicates. Most published studies are devoted to the OH stretching modes of limited mineral groups, e.g., muscovite [2] and kaolinite [3]. The Raman spectra of most phyllosilicates have never been reported, nor has a general review about their major spectral features been written. Preparatory to identifying and characterize phyllosilicates on Mars, a Raman spectral database of phyllosilicates is under development in our laboratory. Phyllosilicates have complex structures and highly variable compositions. Although standard Raman spectra of major types will be included in the database, it is not possible to cover the entire range of compositions, especially those varieties from different types of alterations. Our approach is to (1) obtain high quality spectral data by using a stateof-the-art laboratory Raman spectrometer on pure mineral specimens previously characterized by other mineralogical techniques, and to match them with published data; (2) look for systematics of spectral patterns for all major types of phyllosilicates through empirical observation of the spectral data, so these patterns can be used to classify the phyllosilicates encountered in rock measurements; (3) develop an understanding of the structural and compositional causes for the major features (and differences) of these spectral patterns, and use this understanding  to develop a rationale for identifying phyllosilicates not included in the current database [4].   Figure 1 shows typical Raman spectra of ten common phyllosilicates. Table 1 lists the structuralcompositional classification of these minerals (T = tetrahedral layer, O = octahedral layer, A = interlayer large cation or water). The Raman spectra of most phyllosili cates can usefully be discussed in terms of four spectral  regions: 3800-3000cm-1, 1150-800cm-1, 800-600cm-1, and <600cm-1. The Raman peaks in spectral region 38003000cm-1 are contributed by the stretching mode of OH or water in the phyllosilicate structures. The number of OH peaks, their positions, and their relative intensities vary from mineral to mineral and are controlled by the types and number of crystallographically equivalent sites Raman shift (cm-1) 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 3200 3600 Kaolinite -- Al4[Si4O10](OH)8 Pyrophyllite -- Al2[Si4O10](OH)2 Muscovite -- K{Al2[AlSi3O10](OH)2} Montmorillonite -- Nax(H2O)4{Al2-xMgx[Si4O10](OH)2} Di-Octahedral Phyllosilicates Tri-Octahedral Phyllosilicates Serpentine -- Mg6[Si4O10](OH)8 Talc -- Mg3[Si4O10](OH)2 Phlogopite          -- K(Mg,Fe)3[AlSi3O10](OH,F)2 Biotite       -- K(Mg,Fe)3[AlSi3O10](OH,F)2 Raman shift (cm-1) 400 800 1200 3200 3600 Vermiculite       -- Mgx(H2O)4{Mg3-x[AlSi3O10](OH)2} Chlorite       -- (Mg, Fe, Al)3(OH)6{          (Mg, Fe, Al)3[(Si,Al)4O10](OH)2} Figure 1.

Dickite (kaolinite group) has OH groups occupying four non-equivalent sites, which produces a diagnostic four-peak pattern in this region [4]. Table 1. Classification of common phyllosilicates   The Raman peaks in spectral region 1150-800cm-1 arise from the stretching mode of the Si-Onb bond (Onb = non-bridging oxygen) in SiO4 tetrahedra. Most trioctahedral phyllosilicates have one or more medium strength and well distinguished Raman peak(s) in this region, whereas similar peaks from di-octahedral phyllosilicates are weaker and spread across a wider region. This difference can be interpreted as effects of the higher electronegativity of Al3+ and higher covalency of the AlOnb bond, thus causes a lower fraction NBO<1 (NBO=number of non-bridging oxygen) in di-octahedral compared with NBO=1 in tri-octahedral phyllosilicates.  The Raman peaks in the spectral region 800-600cm-1 are contributed by the vibrational modes of Si-Ob-Si bonds (Ob = bridging oxygen), which connect the SiO4 tetrahedra that make up a layer. Most tri-octahedral phyllosilicates show a strong peak in the range 700-670cm-1 except for the Li- bearing lepidolite. The equivalent Si-Ob-Si peak of di-octahedral phyllosilicates normally occurs above 700cm-1 except for Fe-rich nontronite. In the octahedral layers of di-octahedral phyllosilicates, only 2/3 of the sites are filled with Al3+cations. Because of the partial filling and because the Al3+cation has a much smaller ionic radius (0.57Å) than Fe2+  (0.83Å) and Mg2+ (0.78Å) in tri-octahedral phyllosilicates, it causes distortions of the octahedral and tetrahedral site, a reduction of the T and O layer thickness, and changes in the Si-O bond length.  Using the simplest T-O-T type di- and trioctahedral phases pyrophyllite and talc as examples, the decrease in the mean Si-O bond length from pyrophyllite to talc is ~ 0.05Å [5], which could account for the ~30cm-1 shift of the Si-Ob-Si peak to higher wave numbers. The peak patterns of di-octahedral phyllosilicates are also more complex owing to the distortions of tetrahedral sites, e.g. kaolinite.  The Raman peaks in spectral region <600cm-1 arise from a complex set of translational motions of cations in octahedral sites and in interlayer sites relative to the SiO4 groups in tetrahedral layers, the oxygens, and the OH groups (including their transitional and librational motions) [6, 7].  We find that most Fe-bearing phyllosilicates show a wide, strong peak (or doublet or triplet) at ~550cm-1 (biotite, chlorite, etc.);. In contrast, most Albearing phyllosilicates show a strong wide peak at ~420 cm-1 (muscovite, montmorillonite, etc.) and most Mgbearing phyllosilicates show a strong peak at ~350 cm-1 (serpentine, phlogopite, chlorite, etc.). We are investigating the causes of these features. In addition, we find that most di-octahedral phyllosilicates have a strong peak at ~260cm-1 (except montomorillonite) and most trioctahedral phyllosilicates have strong peaks around 230 and 200cm-1 (except some biotites and chlorites). Finally, in the Raman spectra of a phlogopite - biotite series following the increase of Fe content (Figure 2), we find a systematic wavenumber downshift of the OH peaks and several other peaks, an intensity decrease of the peak at ~360cm-1, and an intensity increase of the peak at ~550cm-1, as well as the peak pattern changes of the SiOb-Si vibration.
