Introduction:  Viking Lander, Pathfinder, and Mars Exploration Rover missions to Mars have found abundant sulfur in surface soils and rocks, and the best indications are that magnesium sulfates are among the key hosts [1-6].  At Meridiani Planum, MgSO4 salts constitute 15 to 40 wt.% of sedimentary rocks [3-5,7].  Additional S is hosted by gypsum and jarosite.  Reflectance and thermal emission spectroscopy is consistent with the presence of kieserite (MgSO4.H2O) and epsomite (MgSO4.7H2O) [3].  Theoretically, the dodecahydrate (MgSO4.12H2O) should also have precipitated [8].   We first examine theoretically which MgSO4 minerals should have precipitated on Mars, and then how dehydration might have altered these minerals. Methods and Materials:  FREZCHEM is an equilibrium chemical thermodynamic model parameterized for concentrated electrolyte solutions using the Pitzer equations [9] for temperatures from <-70 to 25°C, pressures from 1 to 1000 bars, and the system Na-KMg-Ca-Fe-H-Cl-SO4-NO3-OH-HCO3-CO3-CO2-CH4H2O [8,10-15].  The model includes 58 solid phases including ice, 11 chloride minerals, 14 sulfate minerals, 15 carbonate minerals, five solid-phase acids, three nitrate minerals, six acid-salts, one iron oxide, and two gas hydrates.  FREZCHEM was used to establish equilibria with respect to composition and temperature among magnesium sulfate minerals [MgSO4.H2O (kieserite), MgSO4.6H2O (hexahydrite), MgSO4.7H2O (epsomite), and MgSO4.12H2O].  To determine the equilibrium partial pressure of water, P(g),H2O, for a reaction such as  MgSO4.12H2O(cr) ⇔ MgSO4.7H2O(cr) +5H2O(l), (1) we used the following equation: 2.0 7. 12. ,),( 24 24 22 1    = OHMgSO OHMgSO OHH OHg K KK P              (2) where KH,H2O is the Henry's law constant controlling water equilibrium between atmospheric and aqueous phases, and KMgSO4.12H2O and KMgSO4.7H2O are the solubility products for the specified solid phases.  All three constants, and others needed for other equilibria, are quantified as functions of temperature in FREZCHEM. Results:  We first examine the stability of magnesium sulfate minerals in pure binary and ternary solutions;  then we examine the stability of these hydrates exposed to a cold, dry Martian atmosphere.  Figure 1 shows the stability of ice, epsomite, and MgSO4.12H2O between 25°C and the eutectic at         -3.6°C for a pure MgSO4-H2O system.  In this system, the lower hydrates, hexahydrite and kieserite, only form at higher temperatures (48°C and 69°C, respectively).  Using Eqn. 2 (or appropriate analogues), we calculated stability lines for ice, MgSO4.12H2OMgSO4.7H2O, and MgSO4.7H2O-MgSO4.H2O at temperatures from 0 to -50°C (Fig. 3).  This temperature range covers the majority of the summertime diurnal range at low latitudes on Mars, and the colder end of this range is approximately the annual mean temperature at the warmest areas on the planet, such as parts of Meridiani Planum.  An average Martian atmospheric P(g),H2O line is included in Fig. 3 for reference.  In the current cold, dry atmosphere of Mars, ice, MgSO4.12H2O, and epsomite are unstable at the warmer areas on the Martian surface, but kieserite is instead stable.  Dehydration of higher hydrates probably accounts for the apparent presence of lower hydrates of magnesium sulfate hydrates in reflection/thermal emission spectroscopy [3] and the microporous stucture and polygonal cracks of the laminated The presence of other constituents in ternary (or higher) systems can lower the temperatures at which lower hydrates are stable.  For example, hexahydrite is stable at 25°C in a MgSO4-MgCl2-H2O system at 3.8 m MgCl2 [12].  This requires high chloride concentrations that may occur in Martian environments that have previously undergone extensive sulfate precipitation and chloride concentration due to extreme freezing or desiccating conditions [3-5]. Based on the Rover mission to Meridiani Planum, it is likely that the sedimentary rocks at this site formed from acidic brines [3-5, 16-17].  Figure 2 illustrates the stability of magnesium sulfate minerals in a liquid briny MgSO4-H2SO4-H2O system.  At high H2SO4 concentrations (> 4 m), both kieserite and hexahydrite are stable, but only over the narrow temperature range from 18 to 25°C.  It is still the case that epsomite and MgSO4.12H2O are thermodynamically the most stable minerals over the greatest temperature range (Fig. 2) and particularly at the cold temperatures most relevant to the Martian surface.  Epsomite is dominant at high temperatures and high acidities;  MgSO4.12H2O is dominant at low temperatures and low acidities.  Note that ice is never stable in the presence of epsomite in this acidic system (Fig. 2), which is also the case in the pure MgSO4-H2O system (Fig. 1).   sedimentary rocks imaged by Opportunity [16].  Note, however, that if ice is present for whatever reason (e.g., at depth in soil, protected by a duricrust, or at high latitudes), then both epsomite and MgSO4.12H2O are thermodynamically stable.   Zolotov and Shock [18] also concluded that the higher hydrates of MgSO4 are stable in the presence of ice for the much colder surface of Europa (-133 to -193°C).   The presence of hydrated sulfates could account for H2O buried at shallow levels on Mars [19].   The unusual softness of the sedimentary rocks at the Meridiani Planum [3-5] also can be explained by a high abundance of notably soft hydrated sulfate minerals.  If epsomite (molar volume = 146.71 cm3/mol, [15]) is dehydrated to kieserite (molar volume = 56.60 cm3/mol), then there would be a 61.4% loss of volume.  If epsomite initially constitutes 25% of the rock mass [3-5,7], then there would be a rock volume loss of 15.4%, which could contribute to rock softness and development of tensile stresses that may drive polygon formation.
