Introduction:  Salt crusts were observed at the Viking Lander sites [1,2] and consequently at the Pathfinder landing site [3] and by both Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) [4,5].  Investigation of spacecraft data from the the Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper  (IRTM), and the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) have revealed large regional areas of intermediate albedo and intermediate thermal inertia that have been interpreted to be indurated particulate materials [611]. Much of the surface of Mars can be classified as low albedo, high thermal inertia regions, such as Syrtis Major and Sinus Meridiani, or as high albedo, low thermal inertia regions, such as Arabia.  The Oxia province is an example of a region that does not fit that bimodal classification. While its thermal inertia is intermediate between that of the bright areas and that of the dark areas, its violet reflectance is as low as the dark areas and its red reflectance is almost as bright as the bright areas [8].  Since the anomalous color does not fit within a coarse-grained dark 'violet' (less red) to fine-grained bright 'red' trend, the suggestion was made that the area might be composed of a crusted soil [6,7]. This hypothesis was supported in a more extensive study [8].  On the basis of mixing trends determined from the red and blue reflectances, as well as morphology interpreted from Viking Orbiter images, the surface material in Oxia was postulated to be relatively immobile.  Yet the thermal inertia of the material would correspond to a particle size in unindurated material of about 90 µm [12].  This particle size should be easily transported on Mars [13], since it is close to the particle diameter of 115 µm for which the threshold wind speed is at minimum.  Since the unit appears to be immobile, however, an alternative explanation is that the surface material of Oxia is composed of a finer grain size that is somewhat indurated [8].  The color/albedo units characterized in the Oxia region also correspond to those observed in the Chryse region [14], which implies that the crusted soil could have formed over very wide areas of the planet.  Considering the existence of crusted soil at both landing sites, 6000 km apart, this conclusion seems reasonable. If Oxia and similar regions are composed of a crusted material, then the increased particle to particle cohesion must be balanced by an effective particle size that is smaller than 90 µm in order to be consistent with the thermal data.  One possibility then, is that these regions have a similar effective particle size as the bright red dust, in which case these regions would be indurated dust deposits. Most salts, however, are transparent in the visible. Would a transparent salt cause a deposit to darken and to lose blue reflectance?  Iron sulfates such as quenstedtite [8] or jarosite [15,16] are trans-opaque and would explain both the darkening and the loss of blue reflectance.  Abundant jarosite has been identified by the MER Opportunity Rover [4]. Another surficial unit has since been identified that has intermediate thermal inertia, but high albedo [11].  This unit has been interpreted as being a very thin deposit of dust that is thick enough to dominate the albedo, but thin enough that it cannot mask the effects of a higher thermal inertia surface underneath [11].  Alternatively, this region could also be an indurated surface.  In this case, the induration would be composed entirely of salts that are transparent in the visible and trans-opaque salts would not be present in these regions. Although the induration theory seems to fit the data well, the problem is that the thermal conductivity of indurated materials has not been measured, which hinders accurate interpretation.  The project would not be an easy one.  The use of thermal conductivity probes would break the cement bonds upon insertion into the indurated soil and create a layer of disturbed soil around the probe.  This effect would likely lower the thermal conductivity measured relative to the actual thermal conductivity. Creating uniform samples of lightly indurated samples is also not an easy task.  With a line-heat source [12] there is a possibility that any salts grown in situ would preferentially grow around the line-heat source.  Even if this was only a very small effect, it would nonetheless increase the thermal conductivity measured relative to the actual thermal conductivity. While a systematic study has yet to be implemented, a measure of the minimal effect of induration on thermal conductivity has been made for one fluvial sample.  Although it is only one sample, the complete lack of data make presentation of the results, despite the limitations, worthwhile.  Sample.  The sample was a cemented, but very friable deposit in the Ross River in the Simpson desert, Australia.  The collection and transportation of the sample necessarily broke many of the cement bonds.  When the sample was transferred into the sample holder it had already taken the form of a mostly loose particulate material.  Some of the sample was more highly indurated than other parts and the cement retained some identity through the formation of more durable clods.  However, due to the small size of the sample holder, which is otherwise an advantage, and due to the fragility of the platinum heating wire, clods larger than about 3 mm were removed ahead of time and not allowed in the sample holder.  Once the thermal conductivity of the sample in this condition was measured, the sample was removed from the sample holder and the remaining cement bonds were broken by (latexgloved) hand. Experimental Procedures: A particle size analysis was performed prior to the final bond breaking by a gentle sieving by hand, and a final particle size analysis was performed through a normal sieving procedure. The line-heat source method was used to measure the thermal conductivity of sample materials, since it is already set up and is the only laboratory that is currently being utilized to measure thermal conductivity under Martian atmospheric pressures. The laboratory set up was previously described in detail in [12], except that the computer and analog to digital circuit board have been upgraded in order to obtain better resolution in the temperature measurements. A detailed error analysis of the thermal conductivities measured in this laboratory was presented in [12].  The typical precision of the thermal conductivity measurements in this study is ±5%.  For low and high values of the thermal conductivities measured in this study, the precision errors reach ±15%.  The electronic upgrades did not significantly affect assessment of instrumental precision, as these upgrades were made primarily to improve the ease in data collection and precision improvements were minor. Measurements produced in this lab were shown [12] to match those produced by [17] and [18], which are likely to be the most accurate thermal conductivity measurements previously obtained under Martian atmospheric pressures [12]. In order to assess the amount of salt in the sample, the major cations and anions will be analyzed by ion chromatography in E. Shock's laboratory at Arizona State University. Water will be added to the sample in a 5:1 ratio and then filtered so that soluble, salt-forming ions will be extracted from the sample[19].  The solution is divided into two parts and the soluble anions will analyzed by anion-exchange chromatography (Dionex DX-600) using suppressed conductivity detection and a Dionex AS11 column. High-purity hydroxide eluent will be generated by an on-line electrolytic eluent generator. Soluble cations will be analyzed through suppressed conductivity detection using a Dionex Cation-Exchange CS12A column on a Dionex DX120 chromatograph.  Duplicates and blanks will also be run in both cases to insure accuracy.  Estimated analytical uncertainties for this procedure, for all ions, are ±1 %. Results.  The before and after particle size analyses will be presented at the conference, along with the results of the ion analysis and computation of total salt content.  The before and after thermal conductivity measurements will also be presented. The thermal conductivity of the sample before it was broken up is approximately 3x greater than the thermal conductivity of the sample once all of the cement bonds had been broken.  This result should be considered the minimum effect that this amount of salt would have on the thermal conductivity, as unbroken cement bonds would undoubtedly contribute to an actual thermal conductivity that would be higher than what was measured under these circumstances.
