Blaney, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, MS 183-501, 4800 Oak Grove Blvd. Pasadena, CA 91109. email: Diana.L.Blaney@jpl.nasa.gov INTRODUCTION:  How does Martian dust form?  This is a central issue in the evolution of the Martian surface.  For this abstract, dust is the fine grained, oxidized, and hydrated material that gives Mars it's red color and comprises the soils measured at the Viking landing sites and the "bright soils" at the Pathfinder landing site (Smith et al. 1997). The composition of Martian dust is directly linked to the process or processes that formed it.  I propose a two step formation process that accounts for many of the unusual properties of Martian soils. The proposed model has the bright red soil of Mars forming via the interaction of impact generated melt with steam clouds during the impact event.  The sulfates are added later via aerosols from volcanic eruptions.  In this paper we will explore what is know about Martian dust; how the proposed model matches these characteristics; and implications and predictions of this model. PROPERTIES OF MARTIAN DUST Elemental:  Elemental analysis at both Viking (Clark et al. 1982) and the Pathfinder (Reider et al. 1997) landing sites showed that the dust was elementally similar (if sulfur is excluded) at 3 widely separated locations. Sulfur abundance is independent of cation at both Viking sites. Elemental analysis with both the Viking XRFs (Clark et al. 1982) and the Pathfinder APXS (Reider et al. 1997), show that the soils are generally isochemical with basalt if the sulfur and chlorine are removed (e.g. Clark and Baird 1979b, Settle 1979, McSween and Stolper 1980, Baird and Clark 1981, Reider et al. 1997).  This implies that they were formed in an environment of low ion mobility. Measurements of the rocks at the Pathfinder site indicate that the soils are not elementally similar to the local rocks due to differences in Mg and Fe (Reider et al. 1997). Spectroscopic:  Mars has been intensively studies in the visible to thermal infrared by ground-based observers and spacecraft including the Mariner 6, 7, and 9, Viking, Phobos ISM, and currently Mars Global Surveyor. Strong broad absorption features with little structure dominate the infrared spectrum of Martian dust. Hydrated:  Mars has a strong absorption features due to H20 and/or OH, but no well crystalline clays have been identified. (See articles by Roush et al. 1993, Bell 1996 for reviews of this area of research). Iron Oxides: The dominant iron oxide feature on Mars, which gives Mars it's red color, is spectrally reproduced by nano-phase hematite, which is poorly crystalline (Morris et al. 1989, Bell et al. 1990).  Natural occurrences of nano-phase hematite are found in Mauna Kea palagonites, a weathering products of basaltic glass.  However, palagonites do not reproduce the Viking Labeled Release Experiment results (see Banin et al. 1992). Thus the nano phase iron phases which pigment palagonite are a good spectral match for Mars even if palagonite itself is not. Nano-phase iron oxides other than hematite can also match the spectra (e.g. Bishop and Pieters 1995, Banin et al. 1993).   Pathfinder observations of with the IMP camera of the landing site soils have identified a "bright soil unit" showing the broad Fe3+ drop off into the UV without distinctive crystaline iron oxide features.  They have interpreted unit as being similar to the global dust (Smith et al. 1997). Carbonates:  Spectroscopic evidence for carbonates set limits on the amount of at < 1 wt% (Blaney and McCord 1989, Pollack et al. 1990, Roush et al. 1986, McKay and Nedell 1988). Sulfates:  Sulfates have been detected the global dust. However, the band locations and structure do not match aqueous sulfates such as gypsum and anhydrite but rather a poorly crystalline mineral. (Pollack et al. 1990, Blaney and McCord 1995). Magnetic: The results of the magnetic properties experiment at the Pathfinder landing site have been reported in Hviid et al. 1997.  They showed that the magnetic particles have an average saturation magnetization of about 4 Am2/kg.    Colors of the dust sticking to the magnet match that of martian soils at the Pathfinder landing site.    The magnetic material appears to be intimately associated with the silicate portion of the dust and present in most if not all dust grains (grain size is estimated at < 2 µm).  Two possible magnetic minerals are proposed: maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) or feroxyhyte (δ-FeOOH).  If the magnetic mineral if maghemite then 1/3 of the iron mineral is maghemite, implying a second iron phase.  If the mineral is feroxyhyte then all of the iron must be in this phase. Reactivity: The Viking Labeled Release experiment showed the Martian soil was highly reactive.  Smectite clays were required.  Palagonite (a spectral analog discussed below) was not reactive enough.  Calcium and magnesium carbonates could only make up a small part of the soils (<0.5%)  (Banin et al. 1992).   However, the reverse is also true: smectite clays have strong infrared absorption features that are not seen in Martian spectra. Summary:  The general picture that emerges is that Martian dust is highly hydrated, oxidized, with abundant sulfates. It is elementally similar to basalt.  However, the lack of spectral structure excludes most common terrestrial minerals such as smectite clays and many iron oxides. Both reactive and spectroscopic evidence implies low carbonate abundances.  The magnetic properties experiment imply that the magnetic mineral is well mixed with the silicate and is strongly magnetic. IMPACT FORMATION OF MARTIAN DUST:  D. L. Blaney THE MODEL Step 1-Dust Formation:  Kieffer and Simmonds (1980) observed that the impact melt generated by impacts into crystalline rocks on Earth was two orders of magnitude higher than impacts into volatile rich rocks. They concluded based on numerical modeling of the impact process, that the impact melt produced by impacts into volatile bearing rocks wound not form coherent melt sheets. Instead it would be fragmented by the expanding steam vapor cloud and form a fine-grained hydrated material.  Such a mechanism could produce hydrothermally altered minerals on Mars. This type of a formation environment would produce fine grained, hydrated, and oxidized material. Silicate melt would react rapidly with the steam favoring the production of poorly crystalline or amorphous material. The steam would also provide an environment for the hydration and oxidation of the melt.  Rapid formation would allow little time for ion mobility so it would be isochemical with the host rock.  The high temperatures and lack of liquid water would limit carbonate formation. The process would produce large volumes of mobile material that would be widely dispersed by the expanding vapor cloud  allowing for rapid global mixing. The impact formation mechanism for dust does permit the magnetic mineral to be intimately mixed with the silicate component.  This formation mechanism would favor a single iron oxide as the magnetic mineral rather than a mixture of iron oxides.  A critical test of this formation model will be to determine if feroxyhyte (or other iron minerals that match the magnetic properties at the Pathfinder site) can form during this process. Step 2-Sulfate Formation:  Once the dust is formed, the sulfate (and chlorine) is added by the deposition of volcanic aerosols.  The abundance of sulfur at three landing sites (Chryse, Utopia, Ares Valley), the elemental pattern  at these sites point toward the sulfates forming from volcanic aerosols (Clark and Baird 1979b, Settle 1979, McSween and Stolper 1980, Baird and Clark 1981,Blaney 1996,  Banin 1997).  The 4.5 µm sulfate feature does not resemble well crystaline aqueous sulfates minerals but a sulfate weakly bonded to it's cation (Blaney and McCord 1995).   Duricrust formation by volcanic aerosol deposition  would not alter the elemental signature of the parent material and distribute sulfates globally. Sulfate aerosols would chemically bond with the material it lands on.  Sulfates would thus be concentrated in the upper surface and could form a chemical cement. Aeolian processes would mix the sulfates to depth over time.   Some carbonates could be removed from the chemically active zone by the sulfate. IMPLICATIONS AND PREDICTIONS The dust seen on Mars is ancient, mostly representing the ancient highlands rocks from the period of the heavy bombardment. The elemental composition of the dust will be the same as the global average surface composition (normalized by crater density).  The GRS on the 2001 Mars Global Survey will provide information on the global composition of Mars. The sulfates are young.  Volcanic activity on Mars would have to postdate the floods of Chryse, Utopia, or Ares V alley otherwise the sulfates would be dissolved by the floodwaters. Variations in sulfate abundance would be related to global circulation patterns and the distance of a site from a volcanic eruption. Sulfates should exist in region with no fluvial activity. Sulfates crusts could form on rocks even if they appeared clean of dust and weathering rinds.  Additional weathering of rocks would be possible by the sulfate aeorsols as proposed by Banin (1997).   The MGS TES experiment should detect sulfates globally. Mechanical weathering, palagonization, acid fog weathering, and aqueous alteration (both fluvial and hydrothermal) are volumetrically a small part of the Martian dust.  This may in part be due to the difficulty in mobilizing large volumes of these materials. New evidence for soil mineralogy (MVACS TEGA experiment in '98) will continue to imply poorly crystalline / amorphous hydrates and oxides. Carbonates and clays will be rare and associated with local geologic processes.   In situ weathering products derived locally from hydrothermal, aqueous, or ambient alteration will have a different composition than the global dust.  In situ investigation by the '01 Rover will find that materials created by local processes will be mineralogically distinct from the dust.
