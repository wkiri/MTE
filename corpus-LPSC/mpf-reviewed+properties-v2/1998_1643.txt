The high concentration of sulfur in Mars soils measured by Mars Pathfinder (4.0 to 6.5 wt% SO3) [1] confirms the high concentrations measured at the two Viking lander sites (5.9 to 9 wt% SO3) [2].  These extremely high values, at sites separated by 1000's of kilometers, suggest that this is a global phenomenon.  An understanding of the sulfur cycle on Mars is needed for deciphering the origin of these high surface concentrations of sulfur.  Also, with the recent suggestion for evidence of relic biogenic activity in ALH84001 (specifically the formation of sulfides by sulfate-reducing bacteria) [3], confirmation of this finding with other biomarkers is needed.  The changes in sulfur isotopes on Earth through time have been used as an important method for tracking the evolution of life on Earth [4].  Sulfur isotopic systematics in Martian meteorites can be useful for understanding both the high concentrations of sulfur on the Martian surface and evaluating the possibility of life on Mars.  In this study, we have determined the sulfur isotopic ratios in individual sulfide grains by ion microprobe in the Martian meteorites Nakhla and Chassigny. Preliminary sulfur isotopic analyses of pyrite grains in Nakhla and pyrrhotite grains in Chassigny are shown in Fig. 1.  Also shown are the ranges of δ34S found by ion microprobe analysis of Fe-sulfides in shergottitic meteorites [5] and ALH84001 [5,6].  The sulfides in ALH84001 are secondary in nature; the sulfides in the other meteorites are believed to be igneous in origin. The range of δ34S values seen in Nakhla (-1.7 to +4.1‰) is much larger than the range seen in the other igneous Martian meteorites (Fig. 1).  Similarly, the values of  δ34S measured in Chassigny are lighter on average than the other Martian meteorites.  Both rocks are significantly removed from a putative mantle δ34S signature of ≈ 0‰ [5].  These measurements, coupled with the high concentration of sulfur on the Martian surface, suggest that complex processes are occurring in the Martian crust which are capable of concentrating sulfur, as well as fractionating sulfur isotopes.  There are several possible scenarios which may be operative on Mars, and these are discussed below. If sulfur on the Martian surface is the result of volcanic degassing (acid fog interactions [7]) it may be expected to have a positive δ34S value.  The effect of magmatic degassing of sulfur on sulfur isotopes has been treated by [8] to explain sulfur isotopic systematics at Kilauea.  For reasonable values of fO2 in Martian magmas, such as QFM [9] or lower (fO2's much lower than QFM will result in the dominant gas being H2S [10]), degassing of SO2 will enrich the magma in32S.  For example, if the parent magma has δ34S=0 (a mantle signature), residual sulfides in the magma will have negative values, while the gas will have positive δ34S values.  The isotopically light sulfides found in LEW88516, EETA79001, and Chassigny can be explained as resulting from degassing of SO2 from their parent magmas; the near zero δ34S values of QUE94201 and Shergotty resulted from emplacement of magma without significant degassing.  The degassing of SO2 from magmas with an fO2 near QFM would result in positive δ34S values for Martian surface sulfur.  This model can also explain the isotopically heavy sulfides found in ALH84001; they are derived from an isotopically heavy sulfur source in the Mars crust.  At higher fO2's (≈ 1 to 2 log units above QFM) the relative sulfur isotope fractionation between magma and gas reverses; degassing of SO2 will result in the residual sulfides being depleted in 32S (i.e. residual sulfides will have positive values).  This may explain the isotopically heavy sulfides found in Zagami and Nakhla.  A caveat is that there is no evidence to suggest that Zagami has a higher fO2 than Shergotty.  Various amounts of assimilation of isotopically heavy crustal sulfur could explain the values of  δ34S found in Zagami and Nakhla.  By the same reasoning, Shergotty, QUE94201, LEW88516, EETA79001, and Chassigny did not assimilate significant amounts of crustal material in this model. Assimilation of crustal material has been invoked to explain sulfur isotopic variations of the Stillwater Intrusion [11]. SULFUR ISOTOPES IN NAKHLA AND CHASSIGNY:  J. P. Greenwood et al. Lafayette, a nakhlite believed to be related to Nakhla, has evidence of preterrestrial aqueous alteration [12].  The wide range of δ34S values found in Nakhla may be the result of interactions with hydrothermal fluids.  In fact, according to the above model, a rather complex degassing history would be needed to explain the sulfur isotopic systematics of Nakhla.  Of course, a complex hydrothermal system would be needed to explain these values as well.  In favor of the degassing model is that the sulfides in Nakhla and Lafayette are believed to be primary [13,14]. Future work is planned on the nakhlites to help resolve these questions.   Alternative scenarios to explain the sulfur isotopic systematics found in the Martian meteorites can not be ruled out.  Though the range found in Nakhla is large, similar ranges have been found for ubducted subcontinental lithosphere believed to be prisitine mantle material [15].  The high contents of sulfur on the Martian surface may be the result of evaporites which originated when Mars was a warmer and wetter planet. In conclusion, volcanic degassing of SO2 is a mechanism which can explain the high concentrations of sulfur found on the Martian surface by the Pathfinder and Viking missions. Under reasonable magmatic conditions, degassing of SO2 will affect the sulfur isotopic systematics of Mars, producing isotopically heavy gas.  This model can readily explain the δ34S values found in most Martian meteorites, although  it may be inadequate to explain the values found in Nakhla.  Other processes may be needed (i.e. hydrothermal or crustal assimilation).  The positive δ34S values of the secondary sulfides in ALH84001 can be explained as resulting from the incorporation of isotopically heavy sulfur from the Mars crust during the secondary mineralization that formed these sulfides.  This isotopically heavy sulfur would be the result of volcanic outgassing. The large range of δ34S values (>10‰) found in the Martian meteorites (Fig. 1) necessitate a parent body capable of complex sulfur isotopic fractionation processes.  References:  [1] Reider et al.
