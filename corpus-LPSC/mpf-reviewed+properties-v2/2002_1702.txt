  ANDESITE OR WEATHERED BASALT?  MARTIAN SURFACE COMPOSITIONS FROM MGS-TES.  M. B. Wyatt and H. Y. McSween, Jr., Dept. of Geological Sciences and Planetary Geosciences Institute, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, 37996-1410 (mwyatt1@utk.edu).  Introduction:  Studies of low-albedo regions on the martian surface using TES data have identified two distinct surface spectral signatures interpreted as basaltic (Type 1) and andesitic (Type 2) compositions [1,2].  The basalt and andesite surfaces are divided roughly along the planetary dichotomy which separates ancient, heavily cratered crust in the southern hemisphere from younger lowland plains in the north [2,3].  The identification of basalt and andesite on Mars agrees with visible/near-infrared spectroscopic observations of low albedo regions [5] and chemical analyses of rocks by Mars Pathfinder [6] respectively, and has been supported by additional calibrations using a variety of terrestrial volcanic rocks [4,7].  We examine an alternative hypothesis that the martian surface is entirely dominated by basaltic lavas and that the Type 2 surface materials are basalts weathered in a submarine environment. Rationale:  On Earth, andesite forms mostly at subduction zones, where water released from descending slabs promotes mantle melting.  However, there is no evidence for subduction on Mars.  Although andesite can also be produced during fractionation of basaltic magma, this process is inefficient and could not account for a huge volume of andesite [8].  Less fractionation is required for hydrous basaltic melts to reach the composition of andesite, and evidence exists that some martian basaltic meteorites contained water [9].  In this case, however, the northern plains should consist of comparable amounts of andesite and basalt.  The andesite interpretation for the huge expanse of Surface Type 2 materials in the northern plains is thus difficult to explain based upon our understanding of terrestrial igneous processes.   Alternative Hypothesis. The northern lowlands lie, for the most part, below the 0-km elevation datum, and lakes or oceans, possibly fed by large outflow channels originating in the southern highlands, may have occupied this region.  We examine if these surface materials may be reclassified as basalts altered in a lowtemperature submarine environment. Methods:  Linear deconvolution of atmospherically corrected [10,11] Surface Type 1 and 2 emissivity spectra was done using a spectral end-member set designed to represent minerals common in unaltered and low-temperature aqueously altered basalts (feldspars, ortho- and clinopyroxenese, olivines, and a range of clays, carbonates, and sulfates) [ex. 12]. Accurate linear deconvolution is largely dependent on the spectral end-member set representing an appropriate range of compositions in the mixture.  A primary difference between our end-member set and end-member sets used in previous studies [2,4,7] is the omission of a high-silica glass phase in this study.  The high-silica glass end-member has been previously interpreted as representing a primary volcanic glass [2,4,7].  Highsilica volcanic glasses are often not present in high abundances in unweathered basalts and typically alter to clays in a weathering environment.  We also compare a fresh cut and natural surface of a Columbia River Basalt (CRB) sample to the Type 1 and 2 martian surface spectra.   Results:  Overall spectral fits produced by linear deconvolution fall within the standard deviation for Surface Type 1 and 2 spectra (low RMS errors of .0018 and .0014 respectively).  Modeled mineral abundances for Surface Type 1 are characterized by high values of igneous phases (33 vol.% plagioclase and 41 vol.% low- and high-calcium pyroxene) and low values of weathering products (14 vol.% clay/sheet silicate).  Surface Type 1 mineralogy derived in this study is thus representative of a largely unweathered basaltic composition which is in agreement with previous studies [2,4].  Modeled mineral abundances for Surface Type 2 are characterized by only 41 vol.% igneous phases (25 vol.% plagioclase and 16 vol.% high-calcium pyroxene) with alteration products accounting for 45 vol.% (31 vol.% clay and 14 vol.% K-feldspar).  Higher abundances of alteration products, and lower abundances of pyroxenes for Surface Type 2 as modeled in this study, are characteristic of altered basalt. Modeled mineral abundances supporting a weathered basalt composition are largely a result of clays replacing the high-silica glass phase used in previous studies to infer an andesite composition [2,4].  Absorption features between 500-550 cm-1 in laboratory spectra distinguish clays modeled in this study (Fe-smectite and Ca-montmorillonite) from high-silica glass (Figure 1); however, the CO2 atmosphere of Mars is largely opaque is this spectral region, limiting its usefulness for analysis of surface compositions.  The spectral regions of high-silica glass and clays used for analysis of martian surface compositions are very similar in their overall spectral shape and positions of spectral features.  Additional work is needed to better understand the degree to which these phases can spectrally substitute for one another and the spectral effects of varying crystallinity in amorphous phases over a range of chemical compositions.  ANDESITE OR WEATHERED BASALT?  M. B. Wyatt and H. Y. McSween, Jr.  The spectrum of a fresh cut CRB surface displays a broad, slightly squared shape absorption between ~800-1200 cm-1 similar to the Surface Type 1 spectrum while the spectrum of the natural CRB surface displays a more V-shaped absorption similar to the Surface Type 2 spectrum.  Spectral fits produced by linear deconvolution of the fresh cut and natural CRB surfaces show low RMS values (.0031 and .0030 respectively). Deconvolved mineral abundances for the fresh cut surface are characterized by high values of plagioclase and pyroxene, and low values of weathering products similar to Surface Type 1 while the natural surface is characterized by high modeled values of plagioclase with appreciable alteration minerals and lesser pyroxene similar to Surface Type 2. Discussion:  Due to the spectral similarities between high-silica glass and some clays, high-silica glass will partially substitute for clays in a deconvolution of Surface Type 2 (and natural CRB surface) if added to the spectral end-member set.  An increase in silica alteration products from Surface Type 1 to Surface Type 2 is consistent with the mineralogy determined by [2], however with a different lithologic interpretation.  The original interpretation of the high-silica glass spectral end-member phase as a primary volcanic glass may be too limited, as it could also represent an amorphous high-silica alteration product.  The mineralogies determined by [2] and this study for Surface Type 2 can thus both be interpreted as representing weathered basalt.   Figure 2 shows the distribution of Surface Types 1 (green) and 2 (red) in a stereographic polar projection of the northern hemisphere. Blue pixels represent regions covered by fine-grained bright dust which blankets the surface and prohibits spectral analysis of sand and rock compositions.  Also shown is a white line defining contacts previously interpreted as shorelines [13] which approximate an equipotential line [14].  Surface Type 2 compositions in the northern hemisphere are distributed almost entirely within the proposed shorelines, where they are not spectrally obscured by dust cover,  suggesting that martian northern lowland plains materials are basalts weathered under submarine conditions and/or sediments derived from weathered basalt and deposited in this basin.  This hypothesis may explain the absence of andesites among martian meteorites, because either this material might exist as weathering rinds or more thoroughly weathered rocks might not survive impact ejection.  Although the existence of andesite on Mars remains a viable hypothesis, linear deconvolution of martian thermal infrared spectra, spectral matching with terrestrial volcanic rocks, and the distribution of the Surface Type 2 spectrum suggest that Mars is a basalt covered world.
