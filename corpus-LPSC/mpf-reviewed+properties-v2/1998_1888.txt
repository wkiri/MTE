FORMATION OF REGIONAL DURICRUSTED SOILS.  John F. Mustard, Department of Geological Science, Box 1846, Brown University, Providence RI, 02912.  (John_Mustard@brown.edu)  #3040 Introduction:  Much of the environmental history of Mars may be recorded in the soils and layered terrains. For example, the rhythmically layered terrains observed in the chasmata of Valles Marineris may record alternating obliquity cycles or cyclic depositional periods in temporary lakes [1].  Similarly, regionally extensive surfaces with unique remotely sensed properties may be related to specific planet-wide environmental conditions or processes.  The mechanism of formation of these regions also has important implications for the physical and chemical pathways of alteration.  One such type of terrain is typified by Oxia Palus. Observations: Duricrust refers to the case-hardened crusts observed at both Viking landing sites [2]. Remote sensing observations indicate that an important, regionally extensive deposit of duricrusted soil occurs in the Oxia Palus region [3, 4, 5]. In general, duricrusted regions have moderate thermal inertia (3.5-7.7) and albedo (0.15-0.25) and show a correlation between density (from radar) and thermal conductivity [6].  These units are clearly immobile [3]. At the Mutch Memorial Station (MMS), a thick crust with fractures and planar features was exposed by the erosion of the engine exhaust of the lander during landing.  Thin and apparently weak surface crusts were also observed:  a small slump in a dune of drift material was observed at the MMS station that appeared to be due to failure in a weakly cemented surface layer, and at VL 2, one of the rocks displaced by the sampling arm had a thin layer of weakly cemented soil that adhered to the rock and apparently had formed at the interface between the soil and the atmosphere. The crusts and clods at the MMS indicated an increased cohesion relative to drift material while chemical analyses of crust and clods taken at the MMS showed them to be almost identical in composition to drift material, except for an enrichment in sulpher and chlorine [7].  In addition, the spectral observations at the landing sites indicate that crusts and clods are nearly identical to bright dust [8].  These observations were interpreted to indicated that the crusts are fine-grained dust cemented to a variable extent by Mg-sulphates and perhaps chloride salts [7].  The very thin, low cohesion crust that formed at the soil-atmosphere interface implies that this is an active process.  However, the thicker, buried crusts at MMS also show that these crusts can become quite well developed, either over time or as a function of burial.  Crust were also observed at the Mars Pathfinder landing site [9, 10] though perhaps of a different character than at the Viking sites.  The mechanical properties of crusts and clods were similar, but materials like Scooby Doo exhibited a brighter reflectance.  Trends in the APXS results suggest that Mg-sulphates are the cementing agent.  Finally, several acquired by the rover that are available on the Pathfinder web site show crusts adhering to rocks (e.g. Rock Garden). Duricrust Plains in  Oxia Palus:  The canonical model for the composition of the duricrust plains in Oxia Palus consists of a indurated mixture of dark gray sands and dust [3].  However, imaging spectrometer observations by the ISM instrument are not consistent with a simple mixture between dark gray and bright red materials. Mafic mineral absorption features expected from such a mixture are not observed [11, 12], and the character of the absorption near 0.9 µm is inconsistent with the classic absorption properties of nanophase hematite observed in the laboratory and in spectra of broad regions of Mars [13,14].  In addition, these plains tend to exhibit an enhanced water absorption in the 3.0 µm wavelength region, consistent with an elevated soil water concentration relative to bright dust [11].  Furthermore, most materials on Mars exhibit an inverse correlation between albedo and the strength of the 3.0 µm absorption, yet these plains deviate significantly from this trend.  The shape and position of this feature cannot be accommodated with simple mixtures of nanophase hematite and mafic minerals without the appearance of associated features in other wavelength regions that are not observed.  These spectral properties are, however, consistent with several types of very fine-grained ferric oxyhydroxides such as ferrihydrite and goethite. Although it is not possible to discriminate which oxides are present solely on the basis of the ISM data, it is possible to infer likely phases on the basis of conditions and mechanisms of formation. The morphology at the margins of Oxia Palus and associations of materials in Type II dark streaks in the dark red duricrusted soils provide important observations on the nature of materials in these plains.  Type II dark streaks are characterized by dark sands that apparently emanate from splotches in crater floors or depressions, and have bright red deposits on the upwind and downwind sides as well as distinctive narrow deposits of bright red material along their margins [15].  All models for the formation of these streaks are erosional and require the movement of dark gray sands across the Oxia Palus plains.  Cooper and Mustard [16] have modeled the erosional potential of these sands, indicating several 10's of cm up to a few meters of erosion is possible. Mustard, [12,17] has proposed a coupled erosionalmineralogic phase change model to explain these observations.  The duricrusted soils are hypothesized to consist of hydrated ferric oxides (e.g. ferrihydrite) cemented with sulphate salts.  Upon breakdown of the crusts through erosion, the hydrated ferric oxides undergo a dehydration-rearrangement reaction to form typical nanophase hematite soils.  Thus much of the bright dust associated with Type-II dark streaks are derived from this reaction in this model.  Additional observations along Chemical Processes in Martian Soil. .. J. F. Mustard the western boundary of Oxia Palus indicates that where the plains are dissected, the soils are brightened suggesting another location for the dehydrationrearrangement  reactions. Formation of  the Duricrust Plains:   A critical question is how does such an extensive deposit form?  In addition, because the deposit is not bound by topographic variation, it appears to have formed at the surface of the region.  Previously I proposed a surfaceatmosphere exchange model where the duricrust formation was driven by dissolution-precipitation reactions involving adsorbed soil water [12,17]. Models that describe the exchange of water between volatile reservoirs, including adsorbed water in soils, show that significant fluxes of water in and out of surface soils are expected (mg.H2O/cm3/day) and these operate on diurnal, seasonal, and millennial time scales [18, 19]. An advantage of this model is that it clearly can produce duricrust at the surface.  The problem with the model is that ferric oxides have extremely low solubility except at very high pH [20]. Formation of ferric oxides from reduced iron phases is much more energetically favorable.  Burns [21] proposed such a path for acid weathering.  The most easily weathered reduced iron-bearing phase would be volcanic or impact glass.  Glasses are easily weathered under low temperature regimes and in the presence of little water and readily produce ferric oxides and oxyhydroxides.  Ferrous iron in solution (e.g. groundwater) is also readily oxidized to ferric oxides, and the surface of Oxia Palus may represent a fossil groundwater table.  A fundamental question regarding the glass hypothesis is how can a regional deposit of glass be produced? Head and Wilson [22, 23] have examined the geochemical data from Mars from a physical volcanological perspective .  In this analysis, they indicate that basaltic eruptions on Mars are capable of producing prodigious quantities of very fine-grained ash even with the lower volatile concentration hypothesized for martian magmas.  This is a consequence of lower gravity and atmospheric pressure on Mars.  The net result is that widespread and homogeneous deposits of volcanic ash (e.g. glass) which will be enriched in sulpher and chlorine.  Impact processes [24, 25] may also be capable of producing regionally extensive glass layers.  Implications for Mars:   In situ ferrous-ferric alteration of large surficial glass deposits and subsequent cementation by sulphate salts may explain the unique properties and characteristics of the Oxia Palus, and by inference other regions with similar properties.  This new perspective removes the solubility problems of previous hypotheses and ties the observations directly to likely martian processes.  The main implication is that the surface of Oxia Palus represents a time marker:  it requires extensive deposition of volcanic glass to provide the main materials that are altered to form the crusted surface. Detailed observations along the eastern equatorial boundary of Oxia Palus indicates that the extensive layered and eroding deposits of the Arabia region are apparently stratigraphically above Oxia Palus [26].  This would imply that the volcanic deposits are relatively old. Alternatively, the apparent stratigraphy may simply be due to recent deposition at the margin of the terrain and the timing of the volcanic deposition could be more recent.  Further observations and research is planned to develop these concepts. References:   [1] Lucchitta, B. et al, in Mars, (Coffer et al, eds), Univ. of Arizona Press, Tuscon, AZ, 453-492, 1992.
