Introduction: Antarctic micrometeorites are interplanetary dust particles related to the rare hydrous carbonaceous chondrites of the CM and CI group (2% of all meteorites falls) [1]. Most of them are fine grained carbonaceous objects composed of hydrous and anhydrous silicates and iron oxides [1]. They deliver to the Earth ~2000 times more material than meteorites [1]. Their role during the heavy bombardment period (4.23.9 Ga) was probably crucial for the origin of life since they could have delivered some of the main ingredients such as carbon (in the form of CO2 and organic molecules), nitrogen and water [1]. Ferrihydrite, an iron oxide hydroxide, is a very abundant phase in micrometeorites. It contains, several biogenic elements such as N, C, S, P, Ca, Al, Mg, K, Cr and Ni. It has been suggested that this mineral could be the host phase of the organic matter in Orgueil [2] and micrometeorites [3]. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we have performed experiments on synthetic ferrihydrite [4] to study the adsorptive and catalytic properties of this mineral towards the amino acids, fundamental building blocks of life. Materials and Methods: Synthetic ferrihydrite was prepared following the methods described in [4] and characterized as a pure material by Mössbauer spectroscopy, XRD (X ray diffraction) and analytical TEM (EDX and electron diffraction) [5]. We prepared the two types of ferrihydrite known for their XRD pattern as 6line and 2-line [4], the 2-line being least ordered. For the adsorption experiments, amino acid solutions at 100 or 200 µM (1.5 ml) were used together with 150 mg of each type of ferrihydrite. Each solution was incubated with ferrihydrite in a closed vial at room temperature in a rotating sample holder for 24 h and a week. Since no significant increase of adsorption was found after one week relative to 24 h for the individual amino acids, we did not perform the one week experiment for the Pierce standard mixture. Blanks without ferrihydrite were prepared for control. For the catalysis experiments, we performed two types referred to as "wet" and "dry". The "wet" experiment consisted in 2 ml of 50 mM glycine or 100 mM L-alanine in contact with 20 mg 2-line ferrihydrite. The vial (pressured closed) was kept at 95°C for 24 h in constant agitation. The "dry" experiment consisted  in 0.5 ml of the same amino acid solutions with 20 mg 2-line ferrihydrite.  The suspension was poured in a Petri dish and dried at room temperature in order to form an homogeneous layer covering all the mineral surface. Then the Petri dish was heated at 95°C for 24 h. Petri dishes/closed vials without ferrihydrite were prepared as controls. Analyses were performed by HPLC with 3 different mobile phases and UV detection at 195 nm, as well as with an amino acid analyzer (Biotronik LC 2000) with o-phthalaldehyde/2mercaptoethanol as the post-column derivatizing agent. Identification was done by comparing the retention times obtained with those of commercial standards. Figure 1. Adsorption values (%) on both varieties of ferrihydrite after 24 h. The individual amino acids were at 100 µµ M except (RS)-isovaline (200 µµ M). In the Pierce standard mixture, the amino acids (aa) were at 100 µµ M each. Proteic aa are noted by the one-letter code. X1, X2 and X3 are D-alanine, αα -aminoisobutyric acid and (RS)- isovaline, respectively. Values for Gly and D-Ala were not determined with the 6-line variety. 2-LINE FERRIHYDRITE 020 40 60 80 100 G A X1 X2 X3 D E Y H T/S G M F A L V I R K Standard Pierce Ad so rp ti on Individual amino acids 6-LINE FERRIHYDRITE 020 40 60 80 100 G A X1 X2 X3 D E H R K T/S G Y M A F L I V Standard Pierce Ad so rp ti on Individual amino acids  ADSORPTION MEASUREMENTS ON FERRIHYDRITE: G. Matrajt et al. Results and discussion: The results of the adsorption experiments are shown in figure 1 (see also [5]). Several observations can be made. All the amino acids studied are adsorbed to different extents. Glu and Asp, the acid ones, are the best adsorbed. This can probably be explained by the negative charge borne by these amino acids, which strongly interacts with the positive charges of the iron ions in the ferrihydrite. Similar adsorption values were found for L-Ala and Gly in both the Pierce standard mixture and the experiments with these amino acids alone. The adsorption is probably an equilibrium process with different affinities according to the amino acids. The non proteic amino acids are the least adsorbed on both types of ferrihydrite. On the 2-line variety L-Arg and L-Lys, which are both basic amino acids, are poorly adsorbed too, contrary to the 6-line variety. The adsorption is slightly greater on the 2-line variety, except for Arg and Lys. Therefore, even though both kinds of ferrihydrite are chemically similar, it appears that their behavior with respect to the adsorption of amino acids is different. From these results we can conclude that ferrihydrite is a very good adsorptive mineral of amino acids. It behaves as an inorganic "sponge", enabling the concentration of amino acids. Thus, if micrometeorites contain amino acids, ferrihydrite is probably their host phase. Furthermore, all types of micrometeorites are coated with a thin shell (~1 µm thick) of magnetite which protects them, increasing their durability during transport and residence in terrestrial sediments [1]. This shell could also play the role of confining reactants within the small volume of the micrometeorite, helping ferrihydrite to concentrate them [1].

These values are the average of 3-4 different analyses. + the presence of these compounds was detected but not quantified because they are eluted immediately after the injection peak. The results of the catalysis experiments are shown in table 1. We can infer that ferrihydrite is a potential catalyst, allowing the formation of small peptides (diglycine and its cyclic form, di-alanine and its cyclic form, tri-alanine) in a very short time (24 h) at 95°C. Thus, ferrihydrite could have played an important role on the early Earth in concentrating amino acids and catalyzing the formation of peptide bonds. Montmorillonite has been proposed to be one of the main clays responsible for the catalysis of peptide bonds on early Earth [6, and references here in], being specially more efficient in peptide chain elongation. In micrometeorites the major hydrous silicate is a variety of montmorillonite (saponite) [1]. Therefore, they contain two important catalyzers which can complement each other. They must have behaved as cosmoreactors during the early Earth period, participating actively on the processes that led to the origin of life. It has been found that some hydrothermal sources are rich in ferrihydrite [7]. The presence of ferrihydrite on these sources and now the demonstration of the catalytic power of this mineral also supports the scenario of the origin of life in hydrothermal sources [8] on Earth. It would be interesting to check whether in these sources ferrihydrite is also associated with a variety  of montmorillonite. Finally, according to the results of Mars Pathfinder, it seems that magnetic iron oxides such as maghemite [9] and ferrihydrite (Hviid, personal communication) exist on the surface of Mars, thereby allowing the extrapolation of the present results to the red planet [10].
