 MULTISPECTRAL EVIDENCE FOR A SINGLE ROCK TYPE AT THE MARS PATHFINDER LANDING SITE.  R. A. Yingst and P. H. Smith, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona, P.O. Box 210092, Tucson, AZ  85721; yingst@lpl.arizona.edu.   Background: Spectroscopic analysis of the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) landing site revealed several spectral variations in local materials that can be used to classify rock (e.g. [1,2]) and soil types (e.g. [3]). Variations in rock spectra exist chiefly in overall spectral reflectance of a sample and in the slope from redder to bluer wavelengths. Results suggested the existence of three [1] or four [2] discrete rock types or surfaces based upon these criteria, some of which were interpreted to be the result of various weathering processes on compositionally similar rocks. Recent studies [4] isolated two different spectral rock types in an analysis of a subset of rocks in the southwest Rock Garden. These types are shown in Figure 1. 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 Stimpy (side) 3 Moe 1 Bright Soil 1 Dark Soil 1 Disturbed soil F Ref le ct an ce Wavelength (nm) Figure 1. Spectral types of rock and soil at the Mars Pathfinder landing site [3]. Rocks are shown in blue, soils in red. Spectral variations between rocks have been attributed to several explanations, including the mechanical weathering of upwind rock surfaces [2], formation of chemical alteration rinds (e.g. [2,5,6]), and sampling of rocks of multiple compositions [7]. However, the APXS instrument has identified only a single rock type based upon rock chemistry [2]. One variable that may affect rock spectra is variation in the illumination angles from which we view each individual rock face. Illumination on the landing site surface consists of both a direct sun component and a diffuse sky contribution [1] whose affect depends on the amount of dust in the atmosphere. This dust also reddens the atmosphere [8]. The IMP radiometric calibration is designed to remove this reddening effect in cases where the target and the sample surface are parallel. On rock faces this constraint is rarely met. Mantling dust may also play a role in spectral variations of rocks. For example, when maximum reflectance values of spectra are compared to red/blue ratios, the two rock types shown in Figure 1 do not appear as distinct groupings, but as comingled points on a continuous trend pointing generally towards the discrete cluster of points representing Bright Soil [4]. This suggests the increase in both spectral brightness and steepness of the red/blue slope of rocks may be due in part to the mantling of dust that displays spectra similar to Bright Soil. In this study, we attempt to ascertain the magnitude of the effects of illumination variation and mantling dust on MPF spectra. Approach: We assume a simplified model in which all rocks at the landing site represent a single petrology. Observed differences in spectra from rock to rock are to a first order attributed to variations in illumination and differing concentrations of mantling dust, rather than from effects intrinsic to rock composition. To test this hypothesis, we have examined an area around the rock Stimpy that includes a number of rocks classified as either grey/dark or bright/red [1,2]. To remove any spectral variations due to differences in illumination angle, we analyzed only spectra taken for rock faces with surface normals equal to within 10°, as determined using the PickTool program designed at NASA Ames Research Center. By limiting analysis to a single scene, effects of changes in sun angle could also be ignored. We then assumed the remaining spectral differences could be described in terms of the percentage of dust lying on the rock face.  Choosing endpoints of grey/dark rock (Stimpy) and bright soil from the same scene, we calculated a linear mixing model from these endpoints. Although a linear mixing model likely doesn't describe all of the scene complexities, it is a useful tool to explore the contribution of dust to typical rock spectra. A best fit of various spectra at similar surface normals was thus compared to the linear mixing model, to determine how well the model predicted variations in spectral characteristics. Specifically, we examined spectra from the rock Frog, determined to be a grey/dark rock [1,2], and compared these with spectra for similar normals from the rock Moe, similar in spectral signature to rocks classified as red/bright rocks [1,2]. If, after the removal of illumination effects, the spectra from these rocks could be described by the linear mixing model, this would imply that spectral differences can be limited to the effects of illumination and mantling dust. Results: Figure 2 shows two spectral samples from different rocks (Frog in green and Moe in red) that SPECTRAL ROCK TYPES AT MPF:  R. A. Yingst and P. H. Smith  have surface normals within 10° of each other, compared to the range of the calculated linear mixing model described above for 10% mixing increments. Shown also are spectra calculated as best fits to the model based on these two spectra. This degree of correlation between the original spectra from the two rocks and the calculated best-fit spectra is shown graphically in Figures 3 and 4, in terms of both reflectance and percentage error. As can be seen in these figures, the linear mixing model predicts the behavior of these two spectra to within less than ~0.01 for the longer wavelengths, and less than ~0.02 for the two bluer wavelengths. This translates to a percentage error of 5% or less for wavelengths longer than 530 nm and errors between 5-20% for 430 - 530 nm. 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 Stimpy Bright Soil 10% rock 20% rock 30% rock 40% rock 50% rock 60% rock 70% rock 80% rock 90% rock Frog Best Fit Frog Moe Best Fit Moe Ref le ct an ce Wavelength (nm) Figure 2.  Best fits for spectral samples Moe and Frog.  The behavior of spectra in the blue wavelengths is poorly accounted for by the linear mixing model. This may be due to the presence of oxydized coatings or other weathered surface materials on rocks that would not be accounted for in this model (e.g. [2,5,6]). There may be properties of the local soil that preferentially affect the bluer wavelengths that are currently not well understood. It is also possible that this difference between the model and the original spectra represents systematic errors at bluer wavelengths that have not been corrected by the current iteration of the calibration. A final possibility is that the 10° precision of surface normals in this study is insufficient at bluer wavelengths. We note that because of the very low reflectance of the entire scene at blue wavelengths, small reflectance differences between the model and the original spectra translate into very large percentage errors. Indeed, at 430 nm, only ~3% reflectance separates the mixing model endmembers. In addition, if a different dark rock endmember spectrum were chosen, one that varied by even .01% reflectance, the error between the linear mixing model and the actual spectra would be vastly different at bluer wavelengths, but relatively unchanged for the redder wavelengths.  -0.1 -0.05 00.05 0.1 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 data-model (Frog) data-model (Moe) Ref le ct an ce e rr or Wavelength (nm) Figure 3.

These results imply that, to a first order, the various spectral differences between rocks around Stimpy can be plausibly attributed to variations in illumination, coupled with the amount of airfall dust mantling the rock, rather than a variety of petrologies. We are continuing our work to determine whether conclusions for this scene are illustrative of the MPF site.  References: [1] Smith P. H. et al. (1997) Science, 278, 1758-1765. [2] McSween H.
