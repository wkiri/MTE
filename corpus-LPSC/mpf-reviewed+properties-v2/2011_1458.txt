Introduction: Diffuse reflectance spectra and optical functions, or "constants," quantify the refractive and absorptive properties of minerals and are used to generate synthetic spectra of linearly or intimately mixed minerals to compare to spacecraft data.  To maximize the scientific return from visible and nearinfrared (VNIR, λ=0.35-5 µm) mapping spectrometers aboard Mars orbiters, we will provide the data needed to constrain the abundance of candidate hydrated Mgsulfates, as well as their distributions on the martian surface.  Specifically, we will derive optical constants from laboratory VNIR reflectance spectra obtained at 200 and 300 K for hydrated Mg-sulfates, which are aqueous alteration products observed on Mars. Hydrated Mg-Sulfates on Mars:  Sulfates have been inferred for Mars since the Viking and Pathfinder spacecraft missions [1,2], observed on Mars with NASA IRTF, Phobos 2 ISM, MGS TES, MER Spirit and Opportunity, OMEGA, and CRISM [3-11], and found in the Mars-derived SNC meteorite class [1216].  Several Mg-bearing mono- and polyhydrated sulfates in particular are of interest.   Epsomite and hexahydrite salts are expected to form on Mars when MgSO4/(SO4+Cl)-rich solutions are concentrated [17].  Although epsomite and hexahydrite may not be stable on the martian surface [18-19], amorphous derivatives of epsomite and hexahydrite or lower order Mg-sulfate hydrates such as kieserite might be [20-22].  These predictions have been corroborated by positive identifications of Mars, e.g., kieserite and polyhydrated sulfates [23-27], notably in Terra Meridiani [28] and Meridiani Planum [29].  Determining the exact type of Mars sulfates (Mg- versus Fe-rich) may lead to more information on the epoch of formation or humidity conditions on Mars during their formation [30-33].   Methodology:  We will synthesize Mars-relevant hydrated Mg-sulfate samples from reagent-grade epsomite via dehydration or dissolution/precipitation at controlled temperature and humidity, prepare the samples in different size fractions in a glove box under controlled T, P and test them for purity via XRD analysis immediately afterwards, acquire laboratory VNIR reflectance spectra multiple times (i.e., immediately after synthesis, after preparation, and after XRD analysis) to characterize absorptive properties of each material (Fig. 1), and derive optical constants n and k from reflectance peak parameters via scattering theory + subtractive Kramers-Kronig analyses to quantify the intrinsic light scattering properties of the samples (Fig. 2).  We will focus on two main variables:  Temperature: There is a need for both optical constants and reflectance spectra that represent the extremes of Mars surface temperatures (T ~ 280-300 K in equatorial regions to down to 150-200 K in polar winter). Distinguishing between chemical subtypes of sulfates in Mars soil analogs spectrally becomes increasingly more possible as surface temperatures go below 260 K [34].  We will target T=300K and 200K. Grain size: A few recent studies [e.g., 35] have varied pressure-temperature or dehydration conditions to resemble Mars, but at the expense of measuring multiple particle sizes.  The particle sizes in past studies [e.g., 36-40] fall into two categories, motivated by IRTM/TES and MER results: atmospheric dust/siltsized (e.g., < 45 µm size fraction) or sand-sized (~ 200 µm). We will focus on different particles sizes that have not been measured before (53-75 µm, 125-150 µm, and 225-250 µm), to better represent aqueous terrains such as fluvial and lacustrine deposits and allow us to converge on the best set of optical constants (which should be independent of particle size). Significance: Our spectral data and optical constants will provide the means to distinguish between polyhydrated sulfates and identify Mg-sulfates of different hydration states on Mars, from which Mars researchers may further infer how active groundwater, frost, and atmospheric processes once were.  Transport and alteration mechanisms of Mars sulfates can also be inferred based on present distributions and abundances of hydrated sulfates.  While modeling the latter is possible for Ca-sulfates, similar modeling for hydrated Mg-sulfates cannot be performed without the optical constants that we will provide.  Because the hydration state of Mg-sulfates implies particular pressure, temperature, and humidity conditions and the time duration of those conditions, Mars abundances modeled using our data could be correlated to such conditions at different Mars epochs.  Our deliverables will also be essential to future studies of proposed landing sites for the Mars Science Laboratory.
