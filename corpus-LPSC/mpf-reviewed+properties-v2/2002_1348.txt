Introduction:  Mars missions to date have made almost no measurements of minor or trace elements. This will be true until 2007 with the exception of certain elements observable with the gamma-ray spectrometer on Odyssey, and elements such as S and Cl using x-ray spectrometry on MER and Beagle. Yet minor and trace elements hold important clues to understanding Mars� geochemistry. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been under development as a tool for rapid stand-off elemental composition measurements under both NASA in the US and CNES in France.  Here we discuss a number of geochemistry issues for which minor and trace element detection are critical, and assess the applicability of LIBS to these issues. Some Critical Issues Affecting Minor and Trace Element Distributions: Source of sulfur-rich component in Mars dust:  The global martian dust appears to be a mixture of andesitic rocks as measured by Pathfinder APXS, basaltic rocks represented by the shergottites, and a third, salt-rich component.  The source of this third component has been of great interest because of its geochemical significance.  Hints of its composition come from the Viking X-ray fluorescence analyses [1], the Pathfinder APXS measurements [2], and Russian Phobos 2 gamma-ray detector [3].  Suggested origins of this salt component have included �acid-fog�, or volcanic aerosol (VA) [4,5], hydrothermal fluids, or weathering of pre-existing ocean deposits [e.g. 6].  Typical terrestrial hydrothermal fluid systems consist of either the neutral-chloride (NC) type or the acidsulfate (AS) type.  NC systems occur at elevated temperatures in areas with abundant water, and produce chlorine enrichments, but low S/Cl ratios.  AS systems involve condensation of subsurface vapor which enriches sulfur, but does not transport Cl to the surface, hence resulting in high S/Cl ratios.  Newsom et al. [7] showed that a combination of NC and AS systems could account for the major elements found in the salt component, but due to the widespread variability of VA abundances in terrestrial systems, it is impossible to distinguish between hydrothermal (NC+AS) and VA systems based on major elements alone. Minor and trace elements should distinguish between possible sources of the salt component of the martian soil. In particular, lithium is significantly enriched in NC fluids relative to both AS and VA, with an expected abundance of ~100 ppm. On the other hand, volcanic aerosols are enriched in Ba,, Br, Cd, Mo, W, and Zn relative to hydrothermal systems [7].  Ratios of these elements to lithium can clearly distinguish between the potential sources.  Fig. 1 shows several predicted ratios for each of the three types of systems discussed above.     Minor element correlations with oxygen fugacity in Martian rocks: A recent study by Herd et al. [8] found correlations in martian meteorites between oxygen fugacity and trace element chemistry. This study, combined with earlier studies [9,10] on Rb-Sr and Nd-Sm systematics, strongly suggests that the crust-like reservoir is more oxidized, more LREE-enriched, and has heavier δ18O than the mantle-like reservoir.  These correlations suggest that a wealth of information on the provenance of mars rocks is to be found in the mobile trace-element compositions.   Other issues: Certain minor or trace elements may prove essential as exobiology markers. A ubiquitous terrestrial example is the Mn coatings characteristic of terrestrial desert varnishes. Studies of Mn coatings on surfaces in terrestrial caves [e.g., 11] suggest that Mn may be useful as a potential biomarker in subsurface spaces on Mars as well.  Trace elements are also obvious distinguishers of sedimentary rocks in the absence of other distinguishing data.  LIBS Overview:  The application of LIBS for planetary geochemistry has been discussed in numerous places over the past several years [12-18].  Very briefly, LIBS uses a pulsed laser beam to remotely analyze sample spots up to ~1 mm dia at distances up to ~20 m from the instrument by observing the characteristic spectral lines in the induced plasma �spark� to obtain elemental abundances.  Advantages include very rapid, remote analysis, nearly complete elemental coverage, remote depth profiling capabilities, small analysis spot size and relatively low detection limits for most elements.  LIBS Detection Limits depend on instrumental characteristics, such as spectral resolution and optical  MARS TRACE-ELEMENT ABUNDANCES AND LIBS CAPABILITIES:  R. C. Wiens et al.  sensitivity, as well as on the composition of the sample.  Samples with very high abundances of some transition elements (e.g., Fe, Mn, Ti) are likely to have reduced detection limits due to interferences from the numerous emission lines of these elements if the sample is observed with a relatively low-resolution instrument [e.g., 18]. For most samples a spectral resolution of λ/∆λ > 2500 is sufficient.  Table 1 gives rough LIBS detection limits for a number of minor and trace elements, assuming reasonable resolution, sensitivity, stand-off distances, and sample compositions [15].   Table 1 shows that LIBS detection limits are sufficient to address all of the issues mentioned above. In particular, the Ba/Li and Zn/Li ratios should be readily measurable in soils.  For understanding the mobileelement and oxygen fugacity correlations, ratios such as Rb/Sr, Ba/Sr should prove very useful in cases where Rb is higher than in the shergottite basalts (e.g., if there is an analogue to terrestrial continental crust).  LIBS also has sufficient detection limits for potential biomarkers such as Mn, which has been readily demonstrated by depth profiling through desert varnishes in field tests.   Additional notes: Minor and trace element detection, coupled with small analysis spot size, can prove far more useful than comparable detection limits in a larger-sample (e.g., whole-rock) analysis.  For example, using LIBS it is possible to detect the presence of minor mineral phases such as zircons which may not be obvious from whole-rock analyses.  In our 2001 fieldwork at the FIDO rover site [19], one analysis spot yielded a high Ba abundance, signaling the presence of a Ba-rich minor phase.   References: [1] Clark B.C. et al.
