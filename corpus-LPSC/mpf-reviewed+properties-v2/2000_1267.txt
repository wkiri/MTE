Abstract: We are analyzing Superpan data to assess diversity of rock types at Sagan Memorial Station (SMS). We have found that some rocks, which previously went unrecognized, exhibit infrared absorptions indicative of crystalline iron minerals. Previously the only infrared absorption recognized was a 930-nm band in maroon-colored weathering products. "Black rocks" have a broad absorption with a minimum near 930 nm, and a reflectance peak near 670 nm. This compares with a 750-nm peak and an absorption minimum at or beyond 1000 nm in the pervasive "gray rocks." Spectral properties of the black rocks may be consistent with a greater abundance of low-Ca pyroxene than in gray rocks. "Orange rock" has a 750-nm peak and a strong absorption near 900 nm. Orange rock may be a lithology rich in crystalline low-Ca clinopyroxene. Alternatively, its spectral properties could be influenced by a ferric component. The orange and black rocks could represent different geologic units than the andesitic gray rock, or they could be less differentiated products or cumulates from a similar magma. Calibration Refinement and Data Analysis: The SuperPan contains frame-to-frame differences in relative colors that can overwhelm real spectral variations. To correct such artifacts we used an initial calibrated, mosaicked version of the Superpan. Color ratio images were calculated using 670-nm mosaics as a base, to highlight artifacts. Frames were re-registered and radiance factors were corrected multiplicatively frame-byframe until a ratio to the 670-nm base was seamless. Octants were intercalibrated using flat, well-illuminated soils within overlapping parts of the scene, and comparable clean locations on spacecraft structures. As shown in Fig. 1, this procedure reduces artifacts and allows even weak features to be mapped. To elimate from consideration areas illuminated predominantly by sky radiance rather than solar illumination, regions with 440nm reflectance <0.04 were masked. Spectral parameter images were calculated as described by [1] to search for distinctive rocks. Representative spectra were then extracted and analyzed. Three Rock Types Recognized: McSween et al. [2] recognized only one rock spectral class, gray rock. This pervasive material has a low red/blue ratio (indicating minimal coating by drift) and a reflectance peak at 750 nm. No infrared band minimum is resolved. McSween et al. [2] showed that elemental abundances are consistent with a normative high-Ca pyroxene whose band minimum lies at >1000 nm, beyond the wavelength range of the Imager for Mars Pathfinder. Spectral variations were attributed to coating of gray rock by drift or weathering products. We have found two additional spectral classes of rocks with low red/blue ratios. Both appear similar to gray rocks in visible color images (Fig. 2) but are distinct at infrared wavelengths (Fig. 3). Black rocks occur among all rock size classes. They have a broad, strong absorption with a minimum near 930 nm, and a reflectance peak near 670 nm. "Orange" rock is represented by a single occurrence, which has a 750-nm peak and a strong absorption centered near 900 nm. The spectral differences between gray, black, and orange rocks cannot be explained as calibration artifacts, because spectra of gray rocks are essentially unchanged by recalibration. They cannot result from scattered light at small scales, because black and gray rock spectra remain distinctive at all rock sizes. They cannot result from differences in illumination by sunlight and sky, because similarly oriented rock facets observed at the same time appear different. The differences also cannot be effects of drift coatings, because they occur at comparable, low red/blue reflectance ratios. The simplest explanation is that the three rock spectral units represent different lithologies. Discussion: Black rocks' shorter-wavelength reflectance peak and infrared absorption inside IMP's wavelength range (at 930 nm) may result from a greater orthopyroxene abundance than in gray rock. For example, a ~15% increase in orthopyroxene abundance could explain the different infrared properties (Fig. 4). Alternatively, a combination of low-Ca clinopyroxene and olivine might cause the same features. Orange rock's 750-nm peak and 900-nm band minimum make it distinct from maroon rock coatings (Fig. 3), the only materials at SMS that were recognized previously to have an infrared Fe absorption. Orange rock's low 670/440 nm ratio and 900-nm band center are most suggestive of low-Ca clinopyroxene. Alternatively, its properties could arise from mixing of a ferric mineral with a dark, grayer lithology that depresses the 670/440 nm ratio [4]. These results show that, although rocks at SMS may be predominantly of one composition, there does exist spectral heterogeneity comparable to that detected in dark gray regions by orbital NIR spectroscopy [3]. If gray rocks are an andesitic icelandite [2], then lower-Ca pyroxene or olivine in black and orange rocks may be consistent with a less evolved magma from a source similar to that of the gray rocks, or with cumulate rocks from such a magma.
