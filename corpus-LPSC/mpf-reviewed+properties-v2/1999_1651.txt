 Atmospheric Entry and Survival of Small Meteorites on Mars, W.C. Rochelle1, B. Kirk1, N. Smith1, M. DeVall1, and F. Hörz2; 1Advanced Systems Group, Lockheed-Martin, Houston, TX 77058 (bill.rochelle@lmco.com), 2NASA Johnson Space Center, SN2, Houston, TX 77058 Introduction: We propose in a companion paper [1] that some surface boulders at the Pathfinder Landing Site are cratered or otherwise collisionally processed and evolved.  If correct, this implies an impact environment on Mars at scales of decimeters, much smaller than traditionally assumed [2, 3].  However, it is not known whether the observed cratering reflects primary impacts of relatively small meteorites or secondary collisions by martian crater ejecta.  For any "primary" impact scenario to be valid it is necessary to establish that sufficiently small meteorites will survive atmospheric entry.  Therefore, we have initiated such studies using state-of-the-art computer codes that were developed to better understand the reentry of orbital debris and spent spacecraft on Earth [4, 5]. Past atmospheric entry studies on Mars yield somewhat divergent results.  Specifically, [2] postulate that meteorites > 1 kg do not reach the martian surface and that hypervelocity cratering on Mars effectively commences at crater diameters > 50 m.  However, [6] calculates that objects < 1 kg may partly survive to impact Mars at reduced velocity and mass, yet sufficient to produce craters < 1 m.  The most recent study of [7] largely supports [6], yet it centers on potentially less-dense atmospheres on Mars that may have permitted genuine micro-cratering at millimeter scales. The Model: Our calculations used the Simulation and Optimization of Rocket Trajectories (SORT) Program [8], a trajectory code which uses drag coefficients of spheres, combined with thermal subroutines of the Object Reentry Survival Analysis Tool (ORSAT) [9], the latter treating aerothermal and ablation aspects to predict reentry on Earth.  The Mars northern summer atmosphere model [10] was added to SORT, along with an aero-heating routine for CO2 atmospheres [11].  We simulated spherical objects that were allowed to spin, reducing the stagnation heating values by a factor of 0.26.  These spheres were also partitioned into a number of spherical shells (5 or 15) that are successively shed and lost from the system once the heat load times area of the sphere exceeds the heat of ablation of the particular shell. The present model does not consider material strength and potential aerodynamic breakup.  The meteorites simulated were "irons" (using the thermodynamic properties of stainless steel) and "chondrites" (modeled as a mixture of 25% Fe0, 60% forsterite, and 15% fayalite using the thermodynamic data of [12]. Results:  Our efforts thus far are exploratory in nature, examining first-order effects of initial meteoroid size (Ro), arrival speed at the top of Mars'atmosphere (Vo), and trajectory angle (γ).  The major outputs quantify final size (Rs) and impact velocity (Vs) of those objects that reach the Martian surface.  Figures 1a and 1b illustrate the deceleration profiles of chondrite and iron spheres of variable sizes, all entering the atmosphere at 9 km/s and at γ = 45°. Initial meteoroid radius decreases from right to left.  Obviously, Vs (at 0 altitude) will be progressively lower as particle size decreases. Referring to Figure 1a, chondrites of R0 = 6 and 4 cm will encounter the surface at 4 and 2 km/s, respectively.  Smaller particles begin to fall at terminal velocities and objects < 2.14 cm will vaporize at diverse altitudes under these model conditions.  Corresponding data for "irons" are illustrated in Figure 1b and indicate that only 4.4 cm objects make it to the surface, albeit at ~ 3.5 km/s. Small iron objects vaporize more efficiently than silicates due to their superior thermal conductivity, yet they decelerate less on account of their higher density/smaller cross sections.  Figures 1c and 1d show the mass-loss history of these objects and solve for the actual "size" (Rs) of the object that encounters the surface.  Note that the (initially) 2 cm particle (in free fall) is reduced to a 3 mm radius when it reaches the surface, and the R0 = 4 cm particle (at 2 km/s) is reduced to ~ 2 cm.  Similar trends apply to iron meteoroids, although those irons that make it to the Martian surface will have suffered less mass loss than the silicate objects.  Figure 2 shows the survivability of chondrites and irons of variable sizes as a function of variable V0 and constant γ =  20°. Particles to the left of any specific curve suffer total demise.  For example, irons of radii < 16 cm and 15 km/s will not survive, yet particles as small as 2 cm in size will do so at the lowest speeds (5 km/s).  All chondrites of R0 < 9.5 cm will be destroyed at V0 = 15 km/s, yet some 1 cm sized objects can survive at V0 = 5 km/s. CONCLUSIONS:  Our calculations show that objects a few centimeters in radius, weighing < 500 g initially, may principally reach the present surface of Mars at reasonable model conditions.  Their encounter velocities with the martian surface will be ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY AND SURVIVAL OF SMALL METEORITES ON MARS, W.C. Rochelle et al. modest, yet projectiles in the 1 kg mass range may impact at a few km/s.  These results are grossly consistent with earlier studies of [6] and [7].  All of these studies imply that "primary" cratering at relatively small scales (< m) must be considered a viable process on Mars.  Evaluation of absolute cratering rates is beyond the scope of the present effort.  Nevertheless, relative to the Moon, the cratering environment on Mars will undoubtedly lack micro-craters at typical scales < 1 cm, but it should be analogous to the lunar surface, essentially unaffected by atmospheric interactions, at scales > 10 meters.  Unquestionably, the cratering activity at intermediate scales (cm to m) is reduced on the current Mars, but it most likely contributed more prominently to the evolution of martian soils and small-scale surface features than traditionally assumed.
