RATES OF EROSION IN OXIA PALUS, MARS .  Christopher D. Cooper and John F. Mustard, Department of Geological Science, Box 1846, Brown University, Providence RI, 02912. (Christopher_Cooper@brown.edu) Introduction.  The spectral and thermal properties of dark red soils in the Oxia Palus region of Mars, along with their lack of aeolian transport are cited as evidence that these materials are duricrusted soils [1,2].  Furthermore, the near-IR spectral properties are consistent with the presence of ferric oxyhydroxides [3].  While ferric oxyhydroxides are unstable under current Martian surface conditions [4], they may be metastable in the duricrust.  A number of models have been proposed to explain the unique association of dark grey (basaltic) sands, dark red (duricrust) plains, and bright red dust in Type II dark streaks in Oxia Palus [5,6,7], all of which require transport of basaltic sands across the surface.  A new model [8] links the bright dust to the duricrust through a mineralogical phase change.  The ferric oxyhydroxides in the duricrust can undergo dehydration rearrangement [9] after kinetic barriers are relaxed upon disaggregation of the duricrust by the impacts of saltating basaltic sand particles.  In this work, we investigate the erosive potential of basaltic sand transport in Oxia Palus to assess whether aeolian abrasion of duricrust is a significant source of bright red dust. Method.  The time-averaged rate of erosion (R) caused by aeolian abrasion is given by: R = Sa ⋅ q ⋅ f ρt (1) where Sa is the susceptibility to abrasion, ρt is the target density, q is the mass flux (kg/m2 s) of particles carried by winds in excess of the threshold velocity, and f is the frequency with which winds reach this velocity [10].  Taken together, qf is the time-averaged mass flux of particles.  In general, q can be calculated theoretically knowing the wind velocity, atmospheric characteristics, and particle size distribution.  Observations of changes in the extent of Type II dark streaks between Mariner 9 and Viking measurements [5,11] allow qf to be measured more directly. Spectral mixture analysis was applied to Viking Orbiter color data to quantitatively identify the areal abundance of the three fundamental compositional units in this area: dark grey basaltic sand, bright red dust, and dark red duricrust (see Figure 1).  The dark red unit cannot be modeled as a mixture of bright red dust and dark grey sand [3]. Locations where Type II dark streaks advanced into duricrusted plains between Mariner 9 and Viking observations in this area have been documented [5].  These streaks were analyzed to determine their area of change and the fractional coverage by basaltic sand, which is assumed to occur in discrete patches such as ripples or dunes of 10 cm height.  The time-averaged flux of basaltic sand particles onto duricrust in the region, qf, is given by: qf = FbAsdρb t⋅ 1As ⋅ls 2λ p 1− Fb( ) (2) The first term is the mass of particles that entered the new region of the streak per unit time, where ρb is the density of the basalt particles, Fb is the areal fraction of basalt in the streak, As is the increased area of the streak, d is the thickness of the sand patches, and t is the time between the Mariner and Viking observations.  The second term accounts for the area of the target, yielding a total flux into the changed area.  The final term is a scaling factor that adjusts for the effect of individual particles striking the duricrust surface multiple times as they saltate, effectively increasing the particle flux impinging on the surface.  This term gives the average number of bounces per particle on duricrust or dust covered material, where ls is the length of the new portion of the streak, ls/2 is the average distance a sand particle traveled while in that part of streak, and λp = 12.5 m [10] is the average distance a sand particle travels in a single jump during saltation on Mars. The term (1-Fb) scales the result to the flux impacting duricrust not covered by basaltic sands. Figure 1.  Oxia Palus region of Mars.  Dark material is basaltic sand particles that have blown out of intracrater splotches and eroded intermediate grey duricrust, producing mineralogically distinct bright dust.

At the Viking Lander 1 site, blocky material thought to be similar to the duricrust plains [12] had a density of 1600 kg/m3, a cohesion of 5.1 kPa, and an internal angle of friction of 30.8° [13].  The cohesion and internal angle of friction are related to unconfined compressive strength through Coulomb failure theory, giving a value of 18.0 kPa for blocky material.  Suzuki and Takahashi [14] found an experimental relation between compressive strength and rates of RATES OF EROSION IN OXIA PALUS:  C. D. Cooper and J. F. Mustard. erosion.  Equating their erosion relation with that of Greeley et al. [10], a relationship between compressive strength Sc and susceptibility to abrasion can be found: Sa = kρtu 2Sc (3) where k  is an empirical constant (4 x 10-4) from Suzuki and Takahashi [14] and u is the particle velocity.  Using appropriate values of density, cohesion, and internal angle of friction for basalt, a susceptibility to abrasion of 8.7 x 10-5 is found, which agrees with the range of values for basalt found experimentally by Greeley et al. [10] (4 x 10 -5 to 2 x 10-4) and confirms this approach to estimating the susceptibility to abrasion.  Substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (1) gives: R = 2 ×10−4 ⋅ u2Fbdρbls 1− Fb( ) Scλ pt (4) Results.   The rate of erosion was calculated with equation (4) for 22 Type II dark streaks in the Oxia Palus region that changed in size between Mariner 9 and Viking. The results varied from 1.6 - 25 cm/yr (0.1 - 1.5 m of erosion between Mariner 9 and Viking), with an average erosion rate of 8.8 cm/yr (see Table 1).  These erosion rates are extremely large and warrant careful consideration.  The principle sources of uncertainty in this calculation come from the thickness of sand deposits in the streaks and the material properties of the duricrust.  Thinner sand deposits would decrease the calculated material flux and hence the rate of erosion.  The material properties of the blocky material measured by Viking varied by as much as a factor of two [13], which would halve the rate of erosion.  Despite these uncertainties, real erosion rates are unlikely to differ from the derived values by more than one order of magnitude. Table 1.   Erosion Calculation Parameters.

As in m 2, ls in km, qf in g/cm2 s, and R in cm/yr. These results indicate that rapid rates of localized erosion are possible over short timescales on Mars, implying that erosion cannot occur over extended periods of time without destroying the heavily cratered surface observed in Oxia Palus.  Topographic changes due to erosion are not visible at Viking Orbiter resolutions, but may be observed in higher resolution Mars Global Surveyor data.  In addition, at least one Type II dark streak in Oxia Palus lengthened during the course of the Viking mission, implying that the formation of Type II dark streaks is a rapid but transient process.  We propose that this process is initiated by the mobilization of basaltic sand particles in the crater interior and halted by the exhaustion of the supply of these particles.  At least two of the streaks in this region appear to be in the terminal stages of this process, with the dark part of the streak having detached from the source crater as the supply of easily mobilized sand-sized particles was exhausted. Conclusions.   Mustard [8] has proposed that the association of dark streaks and bright dust in the dark red plains of Oxia Palus is related to a mineralogical phase change.  In this model, ferric oxyhydroxides are metastable components of the duricrust and account for its observed spectral properties.  Breakup of the duricrust by the impact of saltating sand grains lowers kinetic barriers by exposing more surface area to the atmosphere.  This allows the ferric oxyhydroxide to transform into more stable ferric oxides through dehydration rearrangement reactions [9], resulting in the formation of the bright red dust.  The bright margins of Type II dark streaks may represent areas of active transformation unobscured by the larger quantities of dark basaltic sand found closer to the center of the streaks.  After the sand supply to the streak is exhausted and the dark sands move downwind from the source crater, a bright ghost image of the streak remains.  This remnant bright area would consist of an exposed thin surface layer of transformed duricrust that has resisted removal by wind action. Our analysis indicates that aeolian transport of sandsized particles can disaggregate duricrusted soils and that a sufficient volume of soil can be disaggregated to explain the association of bright red dust with the dark grey basaltic sands.  The dust produced by the disaggregation and subsequent transformation of duricrust would be a complex assemblage of phases still likely to be cemented by sulfate, but with ferric oxide replacing the ferric oxyhydroxide. This explains the composite nature of the dust determined by the Pathfinder magnetic experiment [15], as well as the high soil sulfur contents measured by both Pathfinder and the Viking Landers [12,16].  Future work will focus on quantifying mineral reaction rates to investigate the proposed phase transformations, which when combined with the erosion rates reported here will allow estimates of the rates of production of ferric oxides and bright red dust in Oxia Palus.
