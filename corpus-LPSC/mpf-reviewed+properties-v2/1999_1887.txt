 HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION PRODUCTS AS KEY TO FORMATION OF DURICRUST AND ROCK COATINGS ON MARS. J. L. Bishop1, 1NRC/NASA-ARC, MS-239-4, Moffett Field, CA 94035 (jbishop@mail.arc.nasa.gov). Hydrothermal alteration of volcanic tephra may produce a corrosive agent that both "chews" up the rock surfaces to form coatings and sticks to finegrained basalt particles on Mars to form the duricrust. Recent magnetic, chemical, spectral and imaging data from Mars Pathfinder suggest that surface alteration and/or weathering has taken place and that there may be coatings on the rocks resulting from these processes [1,2,3,4].  Combining these results from Pathfinder with results from laboratory studies [5,6,7,8,9] provides the clearest picture of the mineralogy and potential alteration processes on Mars. The atmospheric dust particles appear to be related to the surface soils and may be linked to the rock coatings/alteration processes. Sulfate-bearing altered volcanic samples: A bright red tephra sample (250) collected from a cinder cone in the Haleakala crater basin is particularly interesting because of the presence of jarosite as well as iron oxides [7]. A yellow-colored tephra collected near the Mauna Kea summit cone (HWMK24) was also found to contain jarosite, although this sample contains no hematite [8] and would not contribute to the characteristic pigment of the Martian surface material.  Both of these jarosite-bearing "soils" are magnetic and are thought to have formed via hydrothermal alteration of glassy tephra in the presence of sulfurbearing volcanic gases. Potential factors contributing to ferric oxide formation along with jarosite in such soils include the temperature and composition of the volcanic gases, duration of hydrothermal exposure, and oxidation following hydrothermal alteration. Another sample was collected near an active steam vent on the Santorini island chain [7] and contains montmorillonite, kaolinite, hematite, microcrystalline iron oxides/oxyhydroxides, and sulfates (alunogen and alunite) resulting from acid weathering and hydrothermal processes.  Kaolinite and zeolite are consistent with moist conditions. Formation of alunogen and gypsum were recently found in an acid weathering study of a palagonitic soil from Mauna Kea by Banin et al. [5]. They had expected to see alunite and/or jarosite resulting from their study, but only the hydrated sulfate mineral alunogen was formed.  These results suggest that the hydrothermal aspect of acid weathering near a steam vent facilitates formation of the alunite-jarosite series minerals from volcanic tephra. Based on the solubilities of these minerals, jarosite is expected to form preferentially to alunite when both Al and Fe are available [5], however, only alunite formed in the Santorini sample (182).

A recent study of the fine-grained fractions of volcanic tephra indicate that there are "typical", longterm weathering processes for volcanic tephra in a dry environment, as well as more rapid and/or intense alteration processes in the vicinity of steam vents and cinder cones [7].  The more common alteration processes for tephra tend to produce phyllosilicates and microcrystalline iron oxide/oxyhydroxide phases depending on the primary minerals and environmental conditions.  The relatively rapid alteration processes in the vicinity of steam vents and cinder cones emitting sulfuric gases tend to produce sulfate minerals and phyllosilicates. Haleakala sample 250 and Santorini sample 182 from a recent study [7] are examples of such short-term hydrothermal processes. Hydrothermal alteration of volcanic tephra to form jarosite as seen here for Haleakala sample 250 and as seen in HWMK24 from Mauna Kea [8] is a possible mechanism of jarosite formation on Mars.  Previous HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION ON MARS?: J. L. Bishop studies have suggested jarosite formation on Mars as a result of oxidative weathering of sulfides disseminated in kamatiitic basalts [108].  Jarosite exhibits a spectral feature near 0.91 µm (Fig. 1) and has been considered as a component of the Martian surface material at Lunae Planum and other uncommon bright regions having a band here [11].  This band in Haleakala sample 250 (Fig. 1) is heavily dominated by hematite in the reflectance spectra, resulting in a ferric band centered at 0.88 µm.  Spectra of the bright regions on Mars exhibit iron features ranging from 0.86 to 0.91 µm [e.g. 11,12] that could be explained by hydrothermal alteration products of glassy tephra containing jarosite and hematite as well as other iron oxides/oxyhydroxides. Jarosite exhibits a rather sharp doublet at 2.21 and 2.26 µm (Fig. 1) that should be identifiable in spectra of Mars if jarosite is present.  A spectroscopic band has been observed near 4.5 µm in spectra of Mars thought to be due to a sulfate component of the surface material and/or atmospheric dust [13]. Spectra of the sulfate minerals jarosite and schwertmannite do not have a band at 4.5 µm [5]; however, alunite has a prominent feature here [14].  Weaker features at longer wavelengths would be more difficult to identify remotely. Possible alteration/weathering scenarios: The soils and rock coatings measured by the instruments on the Pathfinder rover and lander indicate similar spectral characteristics and chemical abundances, including higher Si than measured by Viking and substantial Fe and S.  This opens the possibility of a genetic relationship between the soils and rock coatings. The magnetic tests indicate the presence of maghemite and/or magnetite in the dust and soils and suggest that this magnetic component must be intimately mixed with the silicates and other components [1]. This supports a chemical weathering scenario where the dust/soil is formed via processes such as alteration of rock surfaces where aggregates of multiple components were produced, rather than a physical weathering scenario where multiple components have mixed via physical processes such as wind or impact. Recently, the idea of "acid-fog" weathering on Mars was suggested [15]; this idea is related to a nonthermal, acid-weathering laboratory study [5] and suggests that sulfate and salt particles in the atmosphere could be altering the rock surfaces and slowly penetrating through the surface particles to form coatings of altered ferric and silicate minerals and/or protominerals generated from the primary rock minerals. Another potential model for rock coatings includes deposition of ferric/sulfate/silicate particles onto the rocks followed by alteration of the primary rock minerals in conjunction with alteration of the sulfates and/or ferric oxide/oxyhydroxide components of the soil particles. The chemical composition, mineral abundances, and visible/NIR spectroscopic properties of Haleakala sample 250 would be consistent with those observed by Pathfinder only after mixing with a neutral substrate material. Samples such as this one, containing jarosite, hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite, could have been produced on Mars in isolated locations near steam vents, where they may still dominate the surface material.  Such samples could then be distributed by aeolian processes and become mixed with the soils formed via more typical palagonitization processes, airborne dust, and/or fine-grained altered material from the surface rocks.  The result could be a layer of finegrained material on Mars that has the chemical, magnetic, and spectral properties observed by Pathfinder. Summary: The Pathfinder Mission has shown us that many of the rock surfaces have coatings/alteration rinds and that the particles suspended in the atmosphere have many properties similar to the duricrust and soil.  The idea presented here is that intense phases (containing jarosite, hematite and/or ferrihydrite, maghemite and/or magnetite) could be produced on Mars via hydrothermal processes.  These are then mixed with fine-grained neutral particles to form the soils and duricrust on the surface and are also distributed through the atmosphere to coat horizontal rock surfaces.  With time these corrosive agents will attack the rock surfaces forming an alteration rind. References: [1]Hviid S. et al., 1997; Science, 278, 17681770.
