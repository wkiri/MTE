Calculations and measurements of dust devil dust flux on Mars are important for determining the role of dust devils in the martian dust cycle. Comparison of dust devils on Earth, Mars, and in laboratory simulations under terrestrial and martian atmospheric conditions show similarities in vortex mechanical structure.  Measurements from Earth [1,2] and Mars Pathfinder [3] show that the magnitude of the pressure well (∆P) in the center of the vortex as a percentage of ambient pressure (0.1-0.5%) is about the same for both planets.  Laboratory measurements, until recently, have not taken that into consideration while measuring dust flux, yielding skewed estimates for Earth and Mars analogs (~0.2-5 g/m2/s and 0.06-0.4 g/m2/s, respectively).  It is possible to scale results to appropriate pressure well sizes in order to model dust devil dust flux at laboratory scales. Previous Work: Work on terrestrial dust devils dates from the mid 1960s by Sinclair [1].  More recent studies by Metzger [2,4] in the Nevada desert and MATADOR  in Arizona [5] corroborates Sinclair's work.  Field work shows that the ∆P in terrestrial cases is about a 0.21.0% drop in the ambient pressure yielding a range in dust fluxes of 0.6-4.4 g/m2/s.  Pressure drops measured by the Mars Pathfinder lander attributed to dust devils passing over the lander show a similar percentage drop yielding a smaller range in dust fluxes of 0.07-0.5 g/m2/s. Combining this with work by Ferri et al. (2003) [6], the mean ∆P for martian dust devils is in the range, 0.1-1.0% of ambient.  Laboratory work by Greeley [7] on vortex threshold measured average pressure drops for all of the tested cases of the Arizona State University Vortex Generator (ASUVG).  Their range in ∆P is 0.002-0.02% of ambient for terrestrial analogs and 0.3-0.8% for martian analogs [8].  Both of these values show that for comparison of dust flux to field measurements, pressure well scaling issues must be addressed. Methods:  Using the ASUVG at both ASU and the Mars Surface Wind Tunnel Facility (MARSWIT) located at NASA Ames Research Center, terrestrial and martian analog conditions can be tested.  Terrestrial ambient (@ ~1000 mb) experiments were completed at both locations and martian-analog (@ ~10 mb) were completed at MARSWIT.  Test plates were filled with airsettled, 2µm dust and placed on an in-situ pan balance.  The ASUVG was allowed to run for set times and then the plate was weighed, measuring the mass loss as a function of time for known vortex conditions.  These mass loss values were converted to average flux values by dividing the mass by time and the cross-sectional area of the vortex. Comparisons to field data were made by scaling the flux in each case by calculating the vortex size based on the pressure drop as a percentage of the ambient atmospheric pressure. Flux values could then be appropriately adjusted based on ASUVG measurements. Results: Preliminary results show that scaling based on the characteristic pressure drop in the vortex can yield changes in the flux values.  It appears the atmospheric density differences between Earth and Mars have a large effect on the efficiency of this pressure drop to lift dust. In the martian analog condition, variations in the magnitude of the pressure well do not effect the dust flux as much as similar variation in the terrestrial case.  This could be a result of density issues that could be included in future scaling attempts.  Future tests including a wider range of pressure wells in both terrestrial and martian analogs will allow better characterization of the efficiency of the ∆P lifting mechanism.
