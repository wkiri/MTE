Introduction: Dust coatings on martian surface rocks will, depending on thickness, partially to completely obscure the chemical and/or mineralogical signature of the rock substrate in remote sensing applications. This is the case for observations over the entire electromagnetic energy spectrum from the thermal infrared (e.g., Mars Global Survey Thermal Emission spectrometer), to the near infrared and visible, (e.g., Hubble Space Telescope and the multispectral Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP)), and to X-rays (e.g., the Mars Pathfinder Alpha-Proton-X-Ray spectrometer (APXS)). The Athena instrument package for the Mars Exploration Rover Mission in 2003 has a thermal instrument (miniTES), a visible, near-IR multispectral imager (Pancam), and two instruments that are sensitive to X-ray energies (Mössbauer spectrometer and APXS) [1]. In [2], we consider the effects of dust coatings on thermal emission spectra. We consider here the effects of continuous and uniform coatings of palagonitic dust on visible, near-IR spectra (for IMP and Pancam multispectral cameras) and on backscatter Mössbauer spectra. Samples and Methods: The rock and mineral substrates consist of disked-shaped slabs (~4 x 0.5 cm) of basalt, andesite, olivine, pyroxmangite, kaolinite+quartz, siderite, and schistose hematite. Additional information about the slabs, information about the palagonitic tephra used as the source of the dust (HWMK919), and the procedure for depositing the dust by an air-fall method are given in [2]. The thickness of the dust layer was measured both with a vertically-calibrated microscope (geometric thickness in microns) and (except for schistose hematite) by weighing the mass of dust for a known surface area (mass thickness in mg/cm2). Flaking of the schistose hematite slab during handling prevented measurement of mass thickness for its dust coat. The density of the dust layer can be calculated using both measurements. The diameter of the dust particles is estimated as <10 µm [2]. A Cary-14 spectrophotometer configured with an integrating sphere was used to record diffuse reflectance spectra between 350 and 2100 nm [3]. A Mössbauer spectrometer built in-house was used to obtain backscatter Mössbauer spectra at 14.4 kev. Briefly, this instrument has four solid-state detectors (AMPTEK) whose output is summed and fed into a multichannel analyzer with 1024 channels. Results and Discussion: The mass thickness of the palagonitic dust layer is plotted as a function of its geometric thickness in Figure 1. The relationship is approximately linear, giving a constant density of ~0.1 g/cm3 for the dust. That is, up to 2 mm, the dust layer did not appreciably compress under its own weight. 0.01 0.1 110 100 1 10 100 1000 Thickness of Dust Coating, Optical Method (um) Th ic kn es s of D us t C oa tin g, Mas s M et ho d (m g/ cm 2) Basalt Andesite Olivine Pyroxmangite Kaolinite+Quartz Siderite Density = 0.1 g/cm3 5 50 500 5000 Fig. 1 Representative reflectance spectra for uncoated and coated slabs are shown in Figure 2 for basalt, schistose hematite, and siderite. The geometric thickness of each dust layer is given in the figure. In each case, the reflectivity of the coated substrate approaches that of the palagonite as the dust layer thickens. For relatively thin layers and for wavelengths >750 nm (i.e., where the dust reflectivity is relatively flat), there is a distinct negative slope compared to the substrate spectra. This observation is most easily seen for the coated basalt because the substrate spectrum is also relative flat. The relationship between the extent of substrate spectral signature to the thickness of palagonitic dust coating is shown in Figure 3 for reflectivity at 444 nm (strongest dust absorption), 600 nm (intermediate dust absorption), and 752 and 1000 nm (weakest dust absorption). As expected, the reflectivity at each wavelength varies between endmember reflectivities (i.e., substrate and substrate with optically-thick coating) in a nonlinear manner, with the reflectivity asymptotically approaching the dust spectrum for the thickest coatings. In accordance with the ferric absorption edge for the palagonitic dust (~400 to 750 nm), the optically-thick depth is the smallest at 444 nm (~75 µm) and the largest at 752 and 1000 nm (~300-400 µm). As shown in Figure 4, the dust layer is not thick to the 14.4 kev γ-rays used in the Mössbauer experiment for the thickest dust layer examined to date (~1000 µm or ~12 mg/cm2). Preliminary results indicate that a 2000 µm (~25 mg/cm2) layer is also not thick.  EFFECTS OF DUST COATINGS ON VISIBLE, NEAR-IR, AND MOSSBAUER SPECTRA: R. V. Morris et al.

The depths for optical thickness that we obtained (75-400 µm depending on wavelength) is a factor of ~2-10 larger than the ~40 µm depth reported by [4]. Because particle diameters for the coating layers are comparable, we suggest that the difference results from different coating-layer densities. Our air-fall dust layer has a very low density (~0.1 g/cm3). Presumably, layers deposited by [4] using a fluid sedimentation procedure are more dense and thinner. In any event, for a given particle diameter, the mass depth (g/cm2) is a more reliable parameter for defining the conditions for optical thickness. Because of the large difference in thickness required for "optically-thick" layers of dust (<10 µm diameter range) in the visible, near-IR, and thermal energy regions (~300-400 µm) versus the ~15 keV energy region (>2000 µm), the Athena Mössbauer Spectrometer can obtain rock-specific mineralogical information from dust-coated rocks under conditions where the Pancam and mini-TES measure only the dust (i.e., dust layers ~300 to at least 2000 µm thick).
