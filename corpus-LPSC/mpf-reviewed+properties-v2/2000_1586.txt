The Beagle 2 mission:  Beagle 2 is a 60 kg lander which is part of the Mars Express mission of 2003-4 [1].  Here we describe the main features of the mission and report on the initial stages of site selection using Viking and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images.  These preliminary sites are being used for modelling the entry and landing of December 2003.   The principal aim of Beagle 2 is to detect traces of any life that has existed on the planet.  It is also expected that precise data about the martian atmosphere's composition and soil geochemistry will be obtained.  The detection of H2O ice will be possible.  A robotic arm with rock chipper attachment and a burrowing 'mole' will enable analysis of unweathered rock and samples from up to 2 m depth.  The main instrumental techniques are panoramic and microscope imaging, Mössbauer and X-ray spectroscopy, gas chromatograph - mass spectrometry.  Major element analyses and KAr ages of rock and soil together with precise isotopic analyses of noble gases, H, C, N, O and S in the atmosphere and rock/soil will be made.  The presence of methane and 12Cenriched deposits will be used as biomarkers.   Potential landing sites need to be suitable for the operation of the Beagle's instrument package (e.g. a soil/rock mixture) and provide a geological environment consistent with the aims of the mission. Landing site constraints:  The main landing constraints are an area between 10oS and 20oN latitude at elevations of ≤ + 1 km in relation to the 6 mbar atmospheric pressure datum.  The landing ellipse size is 240 x 20 km with its long axis orientated 74o clockwise from north.  The surface roughness and an indication of slopes are determined through examination of Viking and MOC images and also by determination of rock abundance using the thermal inertia model of [2].  Rock abundances at the Pathfinder landing site of Ares Vallis (18% of surface predicted to be covered by rocks > 0.05 m diameter [3,4]) are considered an upper safe limit for Beagle 2.  The results determined from the Viking and Pathfinder Landers (16% observed) suggest that the thermal inertia model is accurate [5].    Potential landing sites:  Sites which have experienced the action of liquid water e.g. with ephemeral ponding of water or evaporation of water through surface deposits have exobiological potential. This process could have led to the formation of hard pan layers (e.g. dominated by carbonate, sulphate, clays, oxide cements) within flood plain areas such as Maja Valles or Ares Vallis.  As with previous missions, the sampling of rocks on the ground surface of areas like flood plains will give the potential for sampling a variety of different rock types, including potentially hardpan/sedimentary samples.    The main landing parameters mean that potential landing sites lie within the Amazonis Planitia, Elysium and Chryse regions. However inspection of MOC images suggests the younger lava flow provinces of Elysium [6] may have rough surfaces unsuitable for the lander. Sinus Meridiani, where iron oxide-rich deposits have been identified [6] is ruled out for the same reason.  Two areas which satisfy the landing constraints and are compatible with the aims of the mission are around Maja Valles and Tritonis Lacus (Table 1).   Maja Valles.  Maja Valles leads into Chryse from the Lunae Planum highland region at around 54oW, 18oN from a S/SW direction.  The currently proposed landing ellipse lies to the east of the southern highlands scarp where Maja Valles disgorges through a narrow constriction point composed of a Noachian basement ridge onto Chryse Planitia (Fig. 1).  From here following the channel to the NE, the elevation drops from 0 to -2 km.  This lowest point near the furthest part of the Maja Valles area is the Viking 1 landing site (48.0oW, 22.4oN).  Some roughly N-S running subdued ridges in the region reflect the surface of underlying Amazonian and Hesperian ridged plains (lavas).   Seven MOC images of Maja Valles at or to the east of the highland scarp are currently available. There are more streamlined, fluted features near the centre of the ellipse reflecting the passage of water and sediment towards the NE.  This area is situated just above the + 1 km elevation contour and is centred around 51.1oW, 19.3oN.  It has one MOC image (no. 43804, 6.9 m resolution).  At the resolution of the MOC images (pixel size > 2.4 m) there are no boulders or other obvious obstacles.  Some signs of aeolian activity are seen in the craters and depressions within the channels.  The area has approximately < 1 % craters > 2 km diameter.   At the east and west ends of the area, the land surface does not show such marked landforms and from the Viking images (photomosaics I-I693, I-1305, image resolution < 100 m per pixel) it is clear that the landscape has a more subdued topography.   The elevation decreases from WSW to ENE,  with the -1 km contour near the ENE end of the landing ellipse and the WSW end lying between the 0 and - 1 km contours.  There is a break in topography around 52oW, to the east of which the more marked channel structures are seen.  This is also shown by the MOLA data, with a drop in elevation from -2.6 km at 52.5oW to -2.9 km at 51.5oW.  MOLA elevations drop in total from -2.4 to -3.5 km (W to E) across the landing ellipse.   The channel landforms expose layering or terraces of either erosional or depositional origin. The topography is fairly gentle within the channels (e.g. most of the slopes within the landing ellipse are < 15o) although the central part of the ellipse shown here does contain significant variations in relief.  The thermal inertia is moderate and this is consistent with a rock abundance of 3-10% across nearly all THE BEAGLE 2 MISSION:  J. C. Bridges et al.  of the ellipse.  It reaches 13% at the NE margin of the ellipse.  Tritonis Lacus.  Tritonis Lacus is located north of the southern highlands/northern lowlands scarp and lies at the SW margin of Elysium Planitia.  It was identified by [3] as a possible site for Pathfinder and had previously been considered as a Viking 'safe' site.  This area offers the potential for examining geological environments different from those of Viking and Pathfinder. Tritonis lies within the Amazonian Knobby Plains formation of Elysium Planitia. Greeley and Guest [8] suggest it may have been formed through erosion of older units, leaving relict crater rims and small isolated mesas, scattered across the site.  The region has 5 MOC images in or near the landing ellipse.  MOC image 52705 which lies within the ellipse can be seen at http://ida.wr.usgs.gov/html/orb_0527/52705.html .  MOC images show a landscape with little marked topography, the exception being some mesas which are remnants of the major erosion of the area (e.g. image 23405).  Within the MOC image resolutions (2.6 - 7 m per pixel) there is no evidence for large boulders associated with the erosion of the higher mesas.  The dark granularity present in the MOC images may indicate the presence of boulders (< 6 m) on the surface but could equally well be a response to other terrain features below the limit of the resolution, or simply noise.  There is some evidence for aeolian activity but this is mostly localised within the craters.  These (like the rounded mesas) are less than a few km diameter.  The Tritonis Lacus area has 5-10 % of its area covered by mesas and craters and it is an area of moderate to high thermal inertia.   The currently proposed landing ellipse lies half way between the -1 and -2 km elevation contours, with decreasing regional elevation S to N.  The MGS data reflect this flat topography, with <100 m variation shown in elevations within the area.  The bulk thermal inertia is even across the area (6.3-8.1) and the rock abundance lies between 3-13%, with slightly lower abundances (3-10%) towards the east end of the landing ellipse.    Discussion:  Landing around the Maja Valles outwash area might allow Beagle to photograph layers exposed in the sides of nearby channel structures.  Such images could provide a context for any sulphate or salt-rich analyses found within the soil.  If there are no identifiable hardgrounds the area is still suitable for the analyses of rocks on the surface.  Bearing in mind the source areas for this channel, some of these samples may well be Noachian. The land surface is likely to be similar to the Viking 1 and Pathfinder sites although with some more pronounced topography.  The area is suitable for the mole's operation, but the slightly lower proportion of rock cover means that it should be a safer terrain.  A possible drawback for this area is that the lower thermal inertia compared to Ares Vallis might also indicate a more dusty surface, and this is consistent with the identification of some aeolian features.   Like Maja Valles, Tritonis Lacus has suitable rock abundance, topography and elevation. A possible problem here is that boulders under the optical resolution of the MOC images may be present on the surface. The sampling of material left nearly in-situ through the denudation of preexisting land surfaces and rock layers that are partially preserved in the rare mesas, means that there is potential for sampling a variety of lithologies.
