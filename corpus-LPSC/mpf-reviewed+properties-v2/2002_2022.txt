Introduction:  Images of the Viking and Pathfinder landing sites show surfaces strewn with rocks in a continuous size range, along with duneforms, drifts, and patches of terrain with subtler textures.  Ventifacts, duneforms, drifts, and ripples attest to past and/or present influences of wind moving fine particles through these sites[1-9].  The wind energy responsible for creating and modifying aeolian features is characterized by two key parameters: aerodynamic roughness, z0, and wind friction speed, u*.  Wind profiles close to the surface plot as straight lines in semi-log space.  On these plots z0 is the height at which average wind speed is predicted to be zero, and u* is inversely proportional to the slope of the line (Figure 1). 0.001 0.01 0.1 110 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 He ig ht z (m )Wind speed (m/s) aerodynamic roughness z 0slope = 0.4/u *Figure 1.  Example wind profile from wind speed data measured at four heights, with indicated z0 = 0.01 m and u* = 2.0 m/s (this friction speed also happens to be about threshold-of-motion, u*t, predicted for sand-sized particles on Mars). Both z0 and u* are essential for predicting the potential for wind to move particles across the surface, as well as for modeling fluxes of momentum and heat in the planetary boundary layer. The wind friction speed, u *, is equal to (τ/ρ) 0.5 where τ is total shear stress on the surface and ρ is atmospheric density.  Most sand flux relationships for Mars and Earth determined from wind tunnel studies (using smooth beds of well-sorted particles) are functions of u* 3 [e.g., 10-12].  The Mars Pathfinder windsock experiment directly determined aerodynamic roughness, z0, and wind friction speed, u*, and here these results[13] are used to calculate the threshold-ofmotion wind friction speed, u*t, required to mobilize loose materials at the Pathfinder site, and find that stronger winds would be required than earlier estimates. Shear Stress Partitioning Theory:  As wind blows across the surface, the total wind shear stress on the surface is partitioned among immobile larger rocks and the finer, potentially mobilized particles between them.  As the spacing between rocks decreases and/or the average rock size increases, three inter-related parameters change: (1) the aerodynamic roughness, z0, increases; (2) the total wind shear stress, τ, on the surface is likely to increase; but (3) the proportion of this total shear stress applied to move finer particles between rocks decreases. Point (1) is true only until elements become so closely spaced that they mostly shelter one another; further decreases in roughness element spacing or increases in element size can effectively raise the aerodynamic ground level and reduce z0[e.g., 14].  Point (2) only partly offsets point (3), with the result that relatively stronger winds generally are required to mobilize/reactivate aeolian deposits in rocky areas with higher surface and aerodynamic roughness[15,16]. Raupach[17] and Raupach et al.[18] develop basic theory for calculating the relative proportion of shear stress on non-erodible roughness elements (e.g., rocks) and shear stress applied to the surface between them:         τ τ βλ ττ βλ βλ S R= += +1 1 1 , and            (1) where τ , τ S, and τR, are the total shear stress and the shear stresses on the intervening surface and on the rocks (all normalized over the entire surface), β is the ratio of drag coefficients between the rocks and the surface, and λ  relates the rock height, breadth, and spacing (λ  is the ratio of silhouette area to surface footprint area for each roughness element).  At threshold of motion, the ratio of shear stress normalized only to the intervening surface, τ'S, to the total shear stress over the entire surface is  PATHFINDER WIND FRICTION SPEEDS:  R. J.

Raupach et al.[18] found good agreement when applying equations (1,2) to several previously published wind tunnel experiments[19,20]. Application to the Pathfinder Site:  Application of equations (1,2) to field situations such as the Pathfinder landing site entails some difficulties because determination of β requires knowledge of CS, the drag coefficient for the intervening surface, and this quantity — different from z0 — is more easily estimated for wind tunnel floors (using the law of the wall) than for terrain in the field.  We follow Raupach et al.[18], who used β  ~90 for experiments by Gillette and Stockton[20] involving nonerodible roughness embedded in sand-sized particles. Several rock abundance databases exist for the Pathfinder landing site.  The 2034-element database developed by Albert Haldemann, JPL, was used.  Total ground area of concern in the database is about 141 m2. Of this, 22.6 m2 is covered by rocks, assuming widths measured from the direction of IMP are averages for each rock.  Total rock silhouette area for the landing site area of interest is 7.39 m2, yielding σ = 3.06 and λ = 0.052.  Applying these values to equation (2) yields a (τ'S/τ) ratio of 0.21. Threshold friction speed, u*t, for the most easily moved (i.e., sand-sized) particles in the Martian environment is about 2 m/s[21], corresponding to shear stress of about 0.06 Pa for martian atmospheric density during daylight Pathfinder surface operations.  Combining this value with the (τ'S/τ) = 0.21 implies that a total shear stress shared over the rocks and intervening surface of 0.29 Pa would have been required to initiate sand motion, equivalent to u* = 4.5 m/s.  What would these wind profiles look like?  At the Pathfinder site where z0 = 0.03 m[13], wind speeds would have had to reach about 40 m/s at the top windsock position (or about 45 m/s at the Viking-equivalent height of 1.6 m) for particles to have begun to move.  Higher in the boundary layer, winds of 90 m/s at 100 m would be involved.  Such winds must have occurred over the Pathfinder landing site in the past to account for the drifts, wind tails, and dune-like features observed[4-9]. These predictions for threshold wind speeds are four times higher than the maximum measured by the windsocks during mission operations, and are somewhat higher than the predicted threshold wind profile characteristics reported previously[13].  Particles entrained in such winds could behave as effective erosive projectiles for ventifact formation[cf. 9].  Both the earlier and current results are consistent with no surface changes due to wind being observed during surface operations, even though such changes were actively sought with a minor "change detection" IMP campaign.
