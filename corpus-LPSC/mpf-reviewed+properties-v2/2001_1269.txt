 OPTICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MARTIAN DUST. J.M.Dlugach and A.V.Morozhenko, Main Astronomical Observatory, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Golosiivo, Kyiv 127, 03650, Ukraine, dl@mao.kiev.ua, mor@mao.kiev.ua At the present time as a result of numerous investigations of the martian dust particle characteristics a sufficiently good agreement exists between different estimates of the values of the dust cloud optical thickness and the dust paricle  radius during active stage of dust storms. At the same time  these parameters as well as imaginery part of the refractive index obtained by different authors for highly transparent atmosphere differ greatly. For example, values of the optical thickness τ 0  obtained from  polarimetric measurements (see, e.g. [1]) lie in range 0.003-0.07; using photometric data gives a value of τ 0  < 0.1 (e.g. [2]).  But, the interpretation of the results of measurements made by the Viking 1, 2  and Mars Pathfinder landers directly at the Martian surface led to a conclusion that τ 0  > 0.3 ([3-5]). This interpretation was based on using the data about the solar brightness weakening in the Martian atmosphere. Below  we shall try to give a possible explanation of the discrepancy obtained in the estimates of τ 0 . In  [3-5] the data, obtained during one or two hours after sunrise or before sunset, were analised. The optical thickness of the Martian atmosphere τ 0  was determined using the formula [ ]I I M= −0 0exp τ .                                   (1) Here I and I0  are the measured and extraatmospheric brightness of the Sun, and M is the air mass. It was assumed that optical thickness did not change  during the time between measurements as well as in horizontal plane. The estimates of τ 0  were obtained by solution of a system of equations (1) which was consisted of at least two equations written for different air masses. But, if the optical  thickness changed during the time between observations, such metodology could result in obtaining erroneous values of τ 0 . In detail this problem was discussed in [6]. It was shown that neglect of the variations of optical thickness in time would result in overestimated values of I0 ′and τ 0 ′. For example, if optical thickness decreases with decreasing air mass, they  are related to real values of I0  and τ 0  by the expressions τ τ0 0 21 2 ′ = − −M M M ∆τ,                                    (2) I I M M M M 0 0 1 2 1 2 ′ = − −   exp ∆τ                              (3) Here M1  > M2  and ∆τ ∆= ( )d dt tτ  is decrease in optical thickness during two measurements. Substitution of overestimated value of I0 ′into one equation (1) results in overestimating  τ 0 ″by such quantity [ ]τ τ0 0 2 1 1 2″ − = −M M M M M∆τ (        (4) For example, for M1  =2.5, M2 =2.0 using  (2)-(3) leads to overestimating the extraatmospheric brightness I0 ′by a factor exp( )10∆τ and optical thickness τ 0 by 4∆τ.  Substituting  overestimating value of I0 ′into (4) results in overestimating  τ 0  by 5 ∆τ. As we have noted above, a model of stable (during the time between measurements) atmosphere was adopted in [3,4] for analysis of Viking-1, 2 data. It was obtained: the mean value of optical thickness was equal to 0.5 (Viking-1) and 0.3 (Viking-2);  maximum value of τ 0  was found for morning and evening measurements, that was attributed the presence of fogs with optical thickness ≈ 0.2. Thus, if, for example, fog dissipation or condensation took place during the experiments, assumption about stability of the atmospheric optical characteristics throughout the time of observations would produce erroneous estimates of the atmosphere�s optical thickness. It is not impossible that the atmospheric optical thickness data given in [3, 4] are more or less realistic only for the properties of morning or evening fogs. Our study of the tabulated optical-thickness data [4] has shown  an increase  in optical thickness with decreasing air mass. Using these data and the formulas (3) and (4) for the air mass M=1.5 we have obtained that at the Viking-1 lander site a value of the extraatmospheric intensity might be overestimated by a factor of 1.7 and optical thickness by 0.35.Thus,  it is possible that taking into consideration non-stability of the optical thickness of the Martian atmosphere when interpretating  the  Viking-1, 2  and Mars Pathfinder landers measurements would result in obtaining  much smaller  MARTIAN DUST: J. M. Dlugach and A. V. Morozhenko estimates of τ 0  of the dust component  for clear atmosphere . let us now consider a problem of determing estimates of the imaginary part of the refractive index for dust particles. As regards the real part of the refractive index nr , in  [1] and [7] this characteristic was shown to be practically the same both for transparent atmosphere and during the dust storm of 1971 (1.5 ≤ nr≤1.6). Thus, we can adopt the nature of the Martian dust  to be the same.  These values of ni are close to the real part of the refractive index obtained in laboratory for such terrestrial analogs of the Marian dust as Basalt and Basaltic glass ([8], [9]). We think that the measurements of the Martian disk reflectance A(α) [10] obtained during the peak of the dust storm in 1971 (α=420) may be the most suitable  for determination of the imaginary part ni . The fact is that in this case the Martian atmosphere may be adopted to be semiinfinite, contribution of its gas component and reflection of light by the underlying surface may be neglected. We assumed the dust layer to consist of spherical particles with nr = 1.57 and size variance σ2 =0.2 for lognormal particle size distribution. First, for the wavelenght λ = 0.433 µm (this wavelenght was adopted because of minimum difference between values of ni given in [8], [9]) we calculated the Martian disk reflectivity A(420 ) for different values of mean geometric radius ro and ni =0.00071. As a result, the best agreement between observed and calculated quantities of  A(420) was obtained for ro = 4.5 µm. Such ro corresponds sufficiently well to the data obtained early from polarimetric observations (ro  > 5.7µm [7]). Then, comparing the results of our calculations of A(420)carried out for ro =4.5µm and different ni , with observational data [10] we have obtained such spectral values of the imaginary part of the refractive index: 0.260µm - 0.0025; 0.308µm - 0.0013; 0.336µm 0.0013; 0.366µm - 0.0010; 0.433µm - 0.00071; 0.536µm - 0.00038; 0.654µm - 0.00014; 0.717µm 0.00010. It must be noted that these values of ni are smaller by an order of magnitude the data obtained for high-transparent atmosphere from the analysis of the Martian sky brightness and its azimuth dependence ([3], [11]). At the same time, the obtained values of ni correspond sufficiently well to the laboratory data for basalts [8], [9] for λ < 0.5µm. In order to test the reliability of the obtained values of ro (for the maximum of the dust storm of 1971) and ni we can use such observational fact. It is known that during the dust storm activity peak in October - November 1971 the photometric contrast Ko  of the sutface features was less than 0.03-0.05. We estimated what optical thickness τ 0 had to correspond to such photometric contrast decreasing. Our computations of the intensity of light reflected from an atmosphere of different optical thickness showed the value of  τ 0  to be more than 15. This quantity  agrees well with different estimates of τ 0  obtained for this period. In conclusion we must pay attention to such problem. The Martian dust particles certainly have not spherical  shape. But, the results of laboratory measurements and numerous calculations carried out for spherical and chaotically oriented nonspherical particles of the same effective radius showed the phase function to differ greatly only for the phase angles α < 30 - 400. Hence, we expect that influence of the particle shape is not essential in our analysing the photometric observational data obtained for α = 420.
