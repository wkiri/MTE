Introduction: Areas on Earth with high windspeeds and an ample supply of sand are rich in ventifacts, rocks that have been abraded and sculpted by windborne particles [16].  The abundance of dunes on Mars, many or all of which are probably composed of crystalline sand, is consistent with the finding of many ventifact-like rocks at the Pathfinder landing site [7,8] and some at the Viking sites [9-11].  The well-supported inference that rocks abrade over time on Mars has implications not only for the understanding of aeolian processes on the planet, but also on petrology, orbital remote sensing, and other sub-disciplines which rely on a proper understanding of the texture and history of surface rocks. Unfortunately, the rates at which rocks erode over time and the link between the resulting ventifact morphology and the physical properties of the rock, abrading material, and abrasion conditions, is poorly understood.  Toward that end, we are pursuing wind tunnel studies in which analog rock materials are being abraded under controlled conditions.  The primary goals are to: 1) Produce ventifacts and measure abrasion parameters under controlled conditions at terrestrial and Martian conditions using analog materials, 2) Extrapolate these results to rocks and field conditions, 3) Determine the most important factors affecting rock abrasion.   Here, we report on the setting up of the experiments and targets, calibration runs, and high speed video analyses of particle impacts onto angled faces.    Experimental Setup Open circuit wind tunnels at Arizona State University (ASU) and NASA's Ames Research Center (MARSWIT, operated by ASU) are being used.  The ASU tunnel is run under ambient pressure at freestream wind speeds up to 30 m s-1.  The Ames tunnel can be run up to 11 m s-1 at Earth pressure and up to 80 m s-1 at 600 Pa Martian pressures. In order to increase flux over that achievable with a sand bed source, sand is fed from a motorized hopper at a defined, measurable flux above the roof of the wind tunnel, is entrained in the windstream, and hits abradable targets at a defined angle (Figure 1).  Free stream wind speed, sand size (mass), and hopper-to-target distance are set such that trajectory angle and kinetic energy at impact match what is predicted by  saltation theory [12,13].  For many of the experiments, particle velocities and trajectories at and near the point of impact are measured using high speed video at frame rates of 1000 frames/sec, played back at 30 frames/sec.  Viewed against a grid of 1 cm squares, position as a function of time is determined. Each ventifact model is oriented at a constant angle to the wind (as seen from the side; either 15, 30, 45, 60, or 90°), with three different incidence angles (angle relative to wind as seen from above) per model (0°, 45°, and 60°).  The original casts for the models were made from an ABS-type plastic or wood and produced using computer numerically controlled machining at Ames Research Center.  Molds of the casts were then made out a polymer at JPL (Figure 3).  These molds will serve as shapes to produce models of analog rock materials made of out soft sandstone stimulant, sugar, and clay.  Figure 1: Wind tunnel setup for abrasion experiments.  Theoretical Modeling We are using computer models of hopper trajectories in the wind tunnels and saltation trajectories on Earth and Mars.  This is being done in order to determine the optimum particle sizes and wind speeds needed to best simulate saltation trajectories and kinetic energies using a hopper (Figure 3).  These models, when combined with the determination of sand flux (see above), can be used to determine the total kinetic energy participating in abrasion. The saltation model comes from [13] with modifications made to simulate conditions at the Pathfinder landing sites. These calculations do not take into account momentum loss from the wind stream as a function of sand flux [14].  However, at fluxes of 2-7x10-3 kg s-1, the predictions of height vs. distance match experimental observations.   ROCK ABRASION:  N.T. Bridges et al.   Figure 2: Ventifact positive relief forms (brown shapes) and molds (orange, translucent material).  The molds are filled with abradable rock analog materials and eroded under controlled conditions in the wind tunnel.   Figure 3: Height, kinetic energy, and trajectory angle vs. distance for saltating particles on Mars and hopper-dropped particles in the Ames Marswit tunnel at 600 Pa.  The colors correspond to particle size and the labels on the curves are velocities in m s-1.  The vertical bar in the hopper plots is the distance at which ventifact targets are placed in the wind tunnel.     Initial Results Abrasion of Analog Materials Tests using targets made out of sugar, sandstone stimulant, and dry set clay show that these materials can be abraded on experimental time scales.  Folding in parametric models of rock abrasion [15,16] with our knowledge of  1) the physical properties of these analogs and true rocks and 2) the controlled experimental conditions, we will extrapolate our results to abrasion of actual rocks Impact Physics and Rebound Effects  High speed video shows that sand hitting targets with faces oriented ���� WR WKH ZLQG UHERXQG DQG UH-collide with the targets one or more times.  These rebound effects on high angled faces can increase the impact flux by a factor of 2 or 3, such that initial ventifact formation proceeds at a much more rapid rate than later in the abrasion process.  This may especially be true on Mars, where the flatter trajectories and higher speeds predicted for saltating particles [6,12,13,16] will cause ventifacts to form on time scales faster than on Earth.  This produces an "effective" flux of sand hitting the target that is greater than the flux passing through a unit area per unit time away from the target.  The implication is that high angled rock faces are more susceptible to abrasion than flatter faces.  As a rock forms into a ventifact over time and faces at high angles to the wind become flattened, the effective flux decrease, approaching the value of the actual flux.  Eventually, an equilibrium shape is reached at which flux differences across a rock surface are zero, at which time the final ventifact form is produced.   References: [1] Sharp, R.P. (1949), J.
