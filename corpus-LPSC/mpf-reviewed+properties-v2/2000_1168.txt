 GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF DISSECTED DURICRUST ON MARS.  J. F. Mustard 1 and C. D. Cooper 2, 1Department of Geological Sciences, Box 1846, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912 John_Mustard@brown.edu Abstract:  Evidence for dissected duricrust was identified in high resolution MOC images.  Analysis of all available images was used to map the global distribution of this terrain.  It is apparently restricted to two latitude bands: 30°-60°N and 30°-60°S. Introduction:  Duricrust is a term used to describe martian regolith that has been variably indurated, likely by sulfate or chlorine salts [1,2].  While most clearly observed at the Viking landing sites [1,3], and to a lesser extent at the Pathfinder site [4], extensive occurrences of duricrust have been hypothesized on the basis of remotely sensed data [5].  The importance of duricrust lies in its mode of formation (e.g. surfaceatmosphere volatile transport) and the conditions required to achieve induration.  In this study we use high resolution Mars Observer Camera (MOC) data [6,7] to identify surface occurrences of duricrust and map their distributions. Recognition of Duricrust in MOC Images:  The key properties of duricrust observed at the landing sites are the increased cohesion, internal angle of friction, and remotely sensed thermal inertia relative to drift or unconsolidated material.  The morphology of duricrust exposed by the lander exhaust suggests that thick layers may form, and the presence of thin layers at the surface indicated that formation may be an active process involving surface-atmosphere exchange of volatiles. These properties indicate that duricrust may be recognized as a surface deposit that is relatively resistant to erosion by wind, but if it is eroded, duricrust should be capable of supporting steep slopes of a modest size.  We surveyed available MOC images for surfaces indicative of these properties.  These data show an incredible array of surface features, including yardangs, dunes, and layers resolved down to the resolution of the instrument, that imply long and complex geologic histories.  Nevertheless, we believe that duricrusted regions that have been partially eroded can be recognized.  A clear example is shown in Figure 1.  The main criteria for recognition are: a relatively intact surface must be presented, the intact surface must transition to a hummocky or ridged surface that is topographically lower than the smooth surface, and the hummocks and ridges must be distinct from dunes or other wind deposits.  Results: MOC images from the pre-mapping phase through the mapping phase to March 27, 1999, with spatial resolutions <20 m/pixel were systematically examined for the presence of surface features as shown in Figure 1 (over 1400 images). Evidence for a dissected surface layer was only found in images with resolutions better than 10 m/pixel and more typically in images with resolutions better than 5 m/pixel.  In addition, the expression of a dissected surface layer is enhanced for phase angles >70°.  Confident identification of dissection for phase angles <50° is difficult, possibly introducing a bias in the observations.  Nevertheless, there are sufficient observations at the optimum spatial resolution and viewing angle to identify major trends. The global distribution of MOC images where dissection is recognized is shown in Figure 1.  Essentially no occurrences are found between ±30° latitude Smooth TerrainSmoo Figure 1.

DISSECTED DURICRUST ON MARS:  J. F. Mustard and C. D. Cooper and none at latitudes poleward of ±60°.  There were approximately 800 images in the latitude band of ±30°. Although it appears that there are fewer occurences at southern latitudes, this is likely a sampling bias as there have been fewer images acquired in these regions. As a percentage of images acquired, 44% of the images in the latitude band -30° to -60° exhibit dissection (34 of 77) while only 18% of those between +30° and +60° (60 of 336).  Note that these totals include all images with resolutions better than 10m/pixel and have not been adjusted for images with poor viewing, failed compression, or saturation.  Thus these percentages are likely an underestimate.  The distribution as a function of latitude is shown in Figure 3.  There are clearly two groupings, one in each of the northern and southern hemispheres.  The peaks of the distributions are essentially the same at ≈39° for the northern distribution and at ≈41° for the southern distribution. We have made a number of basic observations regarding the regions that exhibit this distinct morphology interpreted to be dissection of duricrust.  The layer that exhibits dissection follows the terrain, running uninterrupted over ridges and through impact craters. Typically, MOLA topography along boresighted tracks exhibits 10s to 100s of meters of topography.  The undissected surface is very smooth at the MOC resolution which implies a very low local topographic roughness.  Small, fresh impact craters are very rare. These observations imply the surfaces are fine-grained mantled material that were indurated in the recent past. The thickness of the indurated layer is difficult to determine.  MOLA resolution is too coarse to determine the thickness directly.  However, low sun angle images provide some insight on the basis of shadows. For images with resolutions on the order of 2-4 meters, and incident angles between 75°-80°, shadows adjacent to the smooth terrain and orthogonal to the sun direction are typically 2-3 pixels wide.  This implies a layer thickness of 1-3 meters.  An important observation here is that there appears to be a discrete thickness to the layers.  Where the layer is completely removed, a more competent surface remains apparently unaffected by the process of dissection. Regions that exhibit an intermediate stage of dissection between intact and completely removed exhibit a pattern of anastomosing ridges with no apparent preferred direction.  Shadow lengths adjacent to these ridges are on the same order as those adjacent to the smooth terrains.  This implies that the indurated layer has a uniform cohesion which is sufficient to support steep, but short, slopes.  The lack of a preferred orientation of the remnant ridges suggest there is little to no internal structure to the indurated layer.  Finally, in these areas there is a distinct lack of mobile surface material.  Dunes, either bright or dark, are very rare and identifiable mantling material is absent.  Although material could be sequestered in the low areas between the ridges, most of the material liberated by the process of dissection appears to have been removed. Conclusions:   We have mapped with MOC images the global occurrence of distinct near-surface material that exhibits a morphology of smooth surfaces that have been dissected.  This is interpreted to be an indurated mantle, likely duricrust.  These surfaces occur almost exclusively between 30-60°N and 30-60°S with no apparent preference for geologic units.  The thickness of the layer is on the order of 1-3 meters and the remnant morphology of the layer suggest a homogenous material of uniform properties.  Within the currently available data, there does not appear to be an altitude control on the distribution, nor any correlation with Viking thermal inertia distributions. The latitude distribution of these surfaces implies the process of duricrust formation, or the process of disruption and removal, or both are strongly controlled by surface-atmosphere processes.  The exchange of volatiles between the surface and atmosphere is a strong candidate for duricrust formation [7], and the distribution observed implies a mechanism related to large-scale atmospheric circulation.  Martian climate models using current conditions show the 30°-60° latitude bands to be particularly active regions for zonal winds, baroclinic waves and eddies [8], and 30° north or south marks the limit of surface frost formation as well as the transition to minimum adsorbed water in the soils at equatorial latitudes [9].
