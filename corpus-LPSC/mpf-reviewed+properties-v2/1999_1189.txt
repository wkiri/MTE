Introduction: Viking and Mars Pathfinder results show that Martian dust is less than a few microns in diameter. A surface of like-particles this small are difficult to set into motion by simple wind shear and many mechanisms have been proposed to explain how dust is raised into the Martian atmosphere [reviewed by 1,2,3]. Greeley et al. [4] and White et al. [5] conducted threshold experiments and demonstrated that small rocks and other surface roughness elements can reduce dust threshold. To extend these results, exploratory experiments were conducted to determine the amount of dust lifted into the atmosphere as a function of surface roughness under simulated Martian conditions. Experiments: Experiments were carried out in the Mars Surface Wind Tunnel (MARSWIT) at NASA-Ames Research Center. MARSWIT is an open-circuit planetary boundary-layer wind tunnel capable of operating under atmospheric pressures ranging from 3.5 mb to 1 bar. Although experiments can be run in carbon dioxide, most runs use "Earth" air at ~ 10 mb pressure. At ambient laboratory temperatures, this produces the equivalent fluid density of carbon dioxide at 6.5 mb, the average surface pressure on Mars. Three surface roughness were tested. Case 1 was a smooth bed prepared by gluing clay particles to the test floor to produce a 'natural' texture. In Case 2, pebbles 1 to 2 cm in diameter were glued to the test floor with a density of 254 pebbles/m2. In Case 3, twice the number of pebbles (508 pebbles/m2) was used. For each case, atmospheric boundary layer profiles were measured for a range of freestream wind velocities under 10 mb pressure, from which the aerodynamic roughness (zo) values were derived; Case 1 zo = .01 cm; Case 2 zo = .10 cm; Case 3 zo = .15 cm. Flux experiments were conducted using Carbondale Red Clay (CRC), a hematitic kaolin clay used in the ceramics industry. CRC grains are about 1 micron in diameter and were used in our previous threshold experiments [4,5]. CRC was emplaced on the test beds by allowing the dust to settle from suspension. Each test bed contain 24 sample disks, each 10 cm in diameter, mounted flush with the testbed floor and surfaced with the appropriate roughness elements. The disks could be removed, weighed, and replaced in the test section before and after each run to determine dust mass-loss or gain. The dust flux was determined by timing the duration of each run. Each case was subjected to wind shear under Martian atmospheric pressures. In the initial experiments reported here, freestream velocities (u∞) and friction velocities (u*) were set a few percent above the speeds needed for particle movement for each case; Case 1 u∞ = 74 m/s (u* = 3.22 m/s); Case 2 u∞ = 77 m/s (u* = 1.91 m/s); Case 3 u∞ = 72 m/s (u* = 3.53 m/s). Threshold for particles in suspension was determined with an electrometer probe which registered an electrical charge as soon as particles impinged the face plate of the probe, placed above the test bed. Flux was determined from the mass lost/unit area of the test plates per duration of the experiment. In Case 1 (smooth floor), suspension threshold was not achieved, but masses were redistributed across the sample disks (some disks lost mass, others gained mass). This is attributed to the formation of small "dust balls" which rolled across the test bed, but did not saltate nor pass into suspension. Thus, for the purpose of this study, the smooth floor did not produce a flux of dust in suspension. Case 2 (254 pebbles/m2) produced a suspension flux of 1.4E-04 gm/cm2/s, while Case 3 (508 pebbles/m2) resulted in a flux of 3.5E-07 gm/cm2/s. Although insufficient experiments have been MARS DUST:  R. Greeley et al. 2run to make broad generalizations, the results are consistent with assessments of surface roughness on aeolian processes on Earth [6], i.e., that very smooth surfaces of fine particles are not conducive for particle movement and that surface roughness elements can enhance threshold and the resulting flux; this relation holds until the surface becomes too rough, in which case the effectiveness is reduced. In Case 2, it is likely that flux involved dust removal from the tops of the pebbles and from the underlying surface by turbulence generated around individual pebbles. In Case 3, the increased roughness probably did not create effective turbulence around the individual pebbles to reach the surface and even though the dust removal from the tops of more pebbles might have been greater (there were twice the number of pebbles), the net result was a lower flux for the rougher surface. Mars implications:  Pollack et al. [7] estimated the flux of dust in the atmosphere for a 100 sol period during the Viking mission as 4E-03 g,/cm 2/100 sol, or 3.6E-10 gm/cm 2/s. This value is orders of magnitude lower than the results from the experiments. Assuming that the experiments are reasonably valid, this suggests at least two issues for Mars: a) the duration of particle-moving winds and b) the surfaces from which dust is raised. For the first issue, it is unlikely that that the dust observed in the Martian atmosphere was placed into suspension continuously during the 100 sol period of Pollack et al. [7] and so taking an average flux during 100 sols is probably not appropriate. Just as on Earth, aeolian processes occur sporadically, typically in response to short bursts of wind, or through gusts. In addition, Viking [8] and Pathfinder results [9,10,11] demonstrate the importance of dust devils as mechanisms for placing dust into the atmosphere, and it is unlikely that dust devils operate continuously. For the second issue, the experiments suggest a 'Goldilocks' syndrome for dust flux in relation to surface roughness. Very smooth surface might result in little or no flux, whereas very rough surface might inhibit dust being raised into suspension. Consequently, dust probably is not raised from all Martian surfaces.
