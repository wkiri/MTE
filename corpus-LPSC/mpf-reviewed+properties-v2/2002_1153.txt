Background:  Mars Alteration Mars has long been associated with a basaltic composition.  There has been an equally long history in understanding various alteration and weathering scenarios for these source materials.  Given the high abundance of sulfur in the soils weathering models have concentrated on acid sulfate weathering [e.g. 1,2] or palagonitization, a low temperature alteration process occurring in basalt [e.g. 3].  However, both the Pathfinder APXS analysis of bulk rocks and the TES compositional information suggest that some part of the surface may in fact be dominated by andesitic volcanic rocks [e.g. 4,5]. As noted by Morris et al. [6] the soil properties at the Pathfinder site can not be directly derived by chemical alteration of the rocks at the site or from SNC meteorites along any of the well-studied basaltic alteration models.  While much work has been performed to understand the alteration of basalt with application to Mars, little work has been done on acid sulfate weathering of andesitic rocks.  The area surrounding Reno, NV typifies both ancient and presently active hydrothermal systems with acid sulfate alteration and leaching on top of andesitic volcanic rocks and offers an ideal field locality for exploring the associated mineral assemblages and their possible analog to Mars.   Case Region: Steamboat Springs / Virginia City Located approximately 16 km south of Reno, Nevada, Steamboat Springs is an active geothermal area with recent siliceous sinter deposits, containing open fissures venting H2S-rich steam.  Acid solutions produced in the sub-surface by H2S reaction with atmospheric O2, leaches the surrounding rock leaving opal, residual quartz, or quartz+alunite or quartz+kaolinite/montmorillonite alteration assemblages.  These minerals are exposed at the surface in some areas as outcrops of altered basaltic andesite and granodiorite, and can be differentiated based on their thermal infrared (TIR) emissivity spectra. To the east of Steamboat Springs, rocks exposed along Geiger Grade (State Route 341) represent a deeper portion of an ancient acid-sulfate hydrothermal system, where mostly Miocene andesite and dacite flows of the Alta formation have been altered to quartz + alunite with jarosite or hematite coatings, quartz + kaolinite +/- halloysite, or propylitic assemblages with chlorite+albite+quartz+calcite+epidote+/-pyrite [e.g. 7,8].  On the other side of the Virginia Range lies Virginia City, home of the historic Comstock Mining District.  Acid-sulfate alteration of andesitic volcanic rocks is exposed at the surface along structures.  Mineral assemblages typically contain hydrothermal quartz+alunite where alteration was most intense.  Distal to the structures, less intense alteration is pervasive, with quartz+kaolinite, illite and montmorillonite, and chlorite+calcite+pyrite+/epidote assemblages [8].  Data Sets: A number of hyperspectral and multispectral airborne data sets over the region have been acquired. This work focuses on TIR data from both SEBASS and MASTER instruments.  SEBASS measures radiance in 128 spectral channels from 7.8 to 13.5 μm.  Spatial resolution is 2m but the swath is limited to 0.25km.  The instrument a temperature sensitivity (NEΔT) of 0.05 K resulting in signal-to-noise values near 2000:1.  MASTER acquires data in 10 channels from 7.75 and 12.85 μm with a ground footprint of 5 m and a 3.5-km swath.    Analysis:  Initial work focused on calibration and validation of the SEBASS data using both field and laboratory approaches as well as atmospheric compensation algorithms provided by Aerospace Corp (owner and operator of the instrument).  Simple methods such as decorrelation stretching (DCS) can immediately separate quartz, feldspars, clays, and sulfates.  In the color composite below, quartz-rich regions are bright yellow, feldspars are orange/brown, clays are magenta and alunite+quartz areas are pale green.  These dominant mineral components have also been verified with XRD analysis of field samples.  Further work employed techniques established for hyperspectral VNIR/SWIR data analysis (e.g. AVIRIS) to generate mineral classification maps based on matching calibrated emissivity spectra to mineral spectra measured in the laboratory.  Mineral classification maps derived from SEBASS spectral matching using standard ENVI processing techniques are also shown.  In the pixel classification map on the left, quartz-rich areas are yellow, sinter is greenish blue to cyan, alunite + quartz is green, and kaolinite is magenta.  The scene to the right has the same color scheme, except cyan color represents feldspar minerals and two different clay minerals are distinguished: kaolinite and montmorillonite (maroon and magenta).  MASTER data were corrected for atmosphereic effects and calibrated to surface emissivity using mastertir and tem Acid Sulfate Alteration Near Reno, NV: A Mars Analog?: Vaughan et al.   perature-emissivity separation (TεS)  programs developed at JPL.  MASTER calibrated emissivity data were used to derive pixel classification maps with similar methods and will be presented at the meeting.  The MASTER instrument has limitations to the diversity of minerals that can be resolved spectrally, but still had the ability to map dominant lithologies over much larger areas than the SEBASS swath. We will present classification maps derived from each instrument and show spectral separation of the clay, quartz, and sulfate signatures.        References:  [1] Banin et al., J. Geophys.
