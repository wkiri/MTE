 AQUEOUS ALTERATION OF MARTIAN ROCKS, CLODS, SOILS, AND METEORITES: TRENDS IN MAJOR AND MINOR ELEMENTS.  J. D. Stopar1 and G. J. Taylor2, 1SESE, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ (jstopar@asu.edu), 2HIGP/SOEST, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI.  Introduction: Many different instruments have measured the composition of Martian materials both in situ on the surface of Mars as well as in terrestrial laboratories in the form of meteorites. Each analysis has focused on a different component of Martian rocks and their alteration products. Global and regional views are provided by orbiting spacecraft such as the Mars Odyssey GRS and the Mars Global Surveyor TES. Whole rock compositions are addressed by bulk meteorite analysis and the Mars Exploration Rovers' (MER) APXS. The bulk composition of weathered rocks, clods, and soils is provided by the MERs' APXS, Viking landers' XRF, and Pathfinder. Finally, individual minerals and alteration phases within Martian meteorites are examined with various analytical techniques in terrestrial laboratories. By comparing element correlations over these different scales (global, regional, whole rock, and individual components), we hope to better understand general weathering trends and aqueous conditions on Mars. Methods: Major and minor element abundances were determined by electron microprobe (Cameca SX50, University of Hawaii). Elemental abundances in MIL 03346 are compared to MER APXS analyses of Martian rocks and soils [2]; Pathfinder "sulfur-free" rocks [3]; Viking clods and soils [4]; bulk chemical analyses of MIL 03346 [5], Nakhla, and Shergotty [6]; as well as individual minerals and alteration products in Lafayette [7-8], Nakhla [9], and NWA 817 [10]. Results:  Unaltered olivine (cores) in MIL 03346, an average of 10 analyses, contains ~45 wt% FeO, 34% SiO2, 19% MgO, 0.9% MnO, 0.5% CaO, and 0.1% P2O5.  Aqueously altered olivine in MIL 03346, an average of 9 analyses, contains ~42 wt% FeO, 38% SiO2, 6% MgO, 1% SO3, 0.8% MnO, 0.4% CaO, 0.4% Al2O3, 0.4% P2O5, and 0.2% K2O. Aqueous alteration veins found within MIL 03346 olivines, an average of 5 analyses, contain ~42 wt% SiO2, 38% FeO, 3% MgO, 1% SO3, 0.6% MnO, 0.1% Al2O3, and 0.1% CaO5. SO3 vs. SiO2.  Fig. 1 shows SiO2 and SO3 correlations in Martian rocks, clods, soils, and meteorites. In MIL 03346, as olivine is altered, it becomes relatively enriched in SO3 and SiO2 compared to unaltered olivine, because cations are lost to solution and sulfur is adsorbed. In aqueous alteration veins found in MIL 03346 olivines, SO3 accumulates and the relative abundance of SiO2 decreases. This also appears to be the case for many of the MER, Pathfinder, and Viking soils, rocks, and altered materials.  0.1 110 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 wt% SiO2 wt% S O3 MIL Olivine Veins MIL Alt. Oliv.

Fig. 2 shows CaO and SO3 correlations in Martian rocks, clods, soils, and meteorites. CaO and SO3 abundances in MIL 03346 altered olivine and olivine veins are variable, though it appears CaO may decrease as SO3 increases during the alteration of olivine. Ca-sulfates fill voids throughout MIL 03346, which plot in the upper right corner of Fig. 2 (green circles).  0.1 110 100 0.1 1 10 100 wt% SO3 wt% C aO Olivine Veins Alt. Oliv.

Some Gusev rocks show a positive correlation between CaO and SO3, but others do not and, instead, have a positive correlation between MgO and SO3 [12]. All MER, Viking, and Pathfinder rocks, clods, and soils are enriched in SO3 compared to the Martian meteorites Shergotty and Nakhla (bulk analyses of [6]). However, SO3 abundances in the olivine alteration products of MIL 03346 approach those of Pathfinder and Gusev RAT rocks, although CaO is much lower in the olivine alteration veins. Meridiani rocks still contain greater abundances of SO3 than olivine alteration veins in MIL 03346.   Figure 1: SO3 vs. SiO2 Figure 2: CaO vs. SO3 ?  SiO2  vs. Al2O3. Fig. 3 shows SiO2 and Al2O3 correlations in Martian rocks, soils, and meteorites. Bulk MIL 03346 and Nakhla are depleted in Al2O3 compared to the majority of in situ rock, clod, and soil analyses of MER, Pathfinder, and Viking. Altered olivine in MIL 03346 displays a wide range of Al abundances, though it appears that Al2O3 may increase as SiO2 decreases, suggesting that Al and Si are not correlated in aqueously altered olivine. In the aqueous alteration veins in MIL 03346 olivines, there appears to be stronger evidence for a relative decrease in Al2O3 abundances as SiO2 increases, additional support for Al2O3 and SiO2 not being correlated and that aluminosilicates have not formed in these veins.  Discussion: Ca-Sulfates vs. Fe,Mg(Â±K)-Sulfates: In MER analyses CaO and SO3 are not always correlated, which implies little to no Ca-sulfates at some locations. In MIL 03346, a small amount of Fe,K-sulfate (jarosite [13]) is present, but Ca-sulfates are larger and more abundant. It must be noted, however, that at this time, a terrestrial origin for these Ca-sulfates has not yet been ruled out. Though, if they are of Martian origin, like the Ca-sulfates in other nakhlites [14-15], then it is interesting to note that the aqueous alteration of Martian meteorites and the Gusev, Meridiani, Ares Vallis, Chryse, and Utopia Planitia rocks produced different sulfates - even over 200-300-meter scales [12].  Major Element Chemistry of Olivine Alteration Veins. Also plotted in Fig. 3 are alteration veins in NWA 817, Nakhla, and Lafayette. The Lafayette veins plot the closest to bulk MIL 03346 and the majority of MER, Pathfinder, and Viking analyses. The Lafayette veins contain coarse-grained smectites (Al-bearing phyllosilicates) [8], and are unique among the nakhlites. Iddingsite, a fine-grained mixture of a smectite clay (such as saponite) and goethite [16], in Lafayette is the best characterized of nakhlite olivine alteration products because these veins contain well-developed phyllosilicates. The Lafayette veins are more Al,Mg-rich and Fepoor than the other nakhlites. In MIL 03346 and NWA 817, the olivine alteration veins are more Ca-poor than in Lafayette or Nakhla. In NWA 817, the olivine veins have been identified as smectite-bearing [10] and have almost the same abundance of Al2O3 and SiO2 as MIL 03346 veins (Fig. 3). Nakhla veins are intermediate in Al2O3, thus suggesting that the nakhlites may represent a weathering sequence or gradient, where NWA 817 and MIL 03346 are the least aqueously altered, Nakhla is intermediate, and Lafayette has experienced the most aqueous alteration. A weathering gradient has been previously suggested for the nakhlites by [17-19]. Conclusions:  It is not an easy task to make elemental correlations across scales and between different rock types and minerals. However, by attempting to do so, we can observe broad weathering trends that define the larger, more general alteration processes of Mars. As sulfates dominate the alteration products, CaO (or FeO/MgO) and SO3 become correlated, and SiO2 decreases as SO3 increases in relative abundance. If smectites (aluminosilicates) are present, Al2O3 will become correlated with SiO2. Regional and global views of Mars from MGS TES and MO GRS show that sulfate weathering trends tend to dominate (at least for most of the rocks currently exposed at the surface) as Al-mobilization is limited at low pH [20-21]. Nakhlites and shergottites provide important information about aqueous alteration at the level of individual minerals and about the basic processes involved. In MIL 03346, the sulfate (acidic) regime dominates the meteorite's weathering characteristics. With aqueous alteration of olivine in MIL 03346, there is no enrichment in CaO or Al2O3 (neither of which are major components of unaltered olivine), suggesting that the olivine vein materials were primarily derived from olivine components rather than other minerals or outside sources - except for S, which was strongly enriched in solution.
