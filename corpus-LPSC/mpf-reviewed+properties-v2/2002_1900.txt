Introduction:  The impacts of asteroids and comets larger than 100 km in diameter have left more than thirty craters on Mars. Collisions of such large, energetic objects result in the production of meters thick global rock rain layers, which have temperatures in excess of 1600 K. These global rock melt layers warm the near-surface regolith of the planet considerably, keeping it above freezing for  decades or even centuries, and melting subsurface water.  In addition, large impacts inject into the atmosphere a substantial amount of vaporized water, both from the impactor itself and from the target material on the planet, which will condense and precipitate out.  The melted subsurface water and the injected vaporized water will contribute to a global surface water layer meters or more in depth.  The global water layer resulting from a large impact would form rivers and multiple impacts may be responsible for the observed valley networks on Mars.    Impact Products: Figure 1 illustrates the cumulative number of impactors greater than a given diameter [1, 2] based on observations of craters on the Martian surface. We investigate the environmental changes following the impact of a 100 km diameter asteroid travelling at 9 km/s.  Such an impact would have created a crater of the size of Huygens, about 500 km in diameter, and is probably close to the minimal size object that would release a significant amount of water on a global scale. We also investigate the changes following the impact of 200, 300, 500, and 800 km diameter objects, to span the range of impactors in Figure 1. Figure 2 illustrates the average thickness of the ejecta layer resulting from an impact of a given energy [3, 4]; for a 100 km diameter asteroid, a total debris layer (from both the impactor and target material) of about 10 m thickness is produced. Zahnle estimates [4] that about 20% of this debris is "rock rain", with a temperature of 1600 K. This hot, melted debris is distributed globally since it is transported in the thermally expanding melt/vapor cloud. Eighty percent of the total debris from the impact is pulverized ejecta, at a lower temperature near 400 K. This ejecta layer decreases like the cube of the distance from the crater. Although the pulverized material makes up the bulk of the total ejecta, it is localized within a few crater diameters. It is the hotter global rock rain layer that we are interested in, since it is global in extent. We assume, as illustrated in Figure 2, that about 1% of the total ejecta layer (2m rock rain + 8m pulverized ejecta for our 100 km diameter example) is water. Here for a 100 km impactor, about 10 cm of water is vaporized along with the global debris. This water is injected into the atmosphere, and is too hot to condense immediately. Our model follows the condensation and precipitation of this water over time. Model: We simulate the environment on Mars following the emplacement of this hot global rock layer and the injection of the water into the atmosphere using a 1-dimensional radiative transfer code to calculate the evolution of the atmospheric temperature following the impact [5] and a 1-dimensional model of the regolith to calculate the evolution of the ground temperature. The model is adjusted for early Martian conditions by reducing the solar constant to 75% of its present value, and by increasing the post impact CO2 presssure to 150 mbar [6].  The relative humidity is calculated at each level at every time step as the temperature evolves. When the humidity at a particular level exceeds 100%, the relative humidity is decreased to 100%, new mixing ratios for the water and CO2 are calculated, and the water rained out is saved in a virtual bucket.  Once water is rained out it is considered lost from the system. The atmospheric model is coupled to a timemarching, finite-differencing subsurface model which calculates the temperature in 30 unequally spaced subsurface layers that extend downward to 900 m.  The subsurface model calculates the temperature change via conduction in the middle layers, and due to conduction, radiation, and sensible heat transport in the surface layer. Below the debris layer is the original Martian regolith, which we assume is also 1% water (very conservative [7]). As conduction occurs between the 1600 K debris layer and the regolith below it, the subsurface layers warm. When a layer's temperature exceeds the freezing point of water, the water contained in the layer flows freely from the regolith into a virtual bucket, until the water is exhausted.   Preliminary Results and Conclusions:  We find that the planet can be kept warm for decades or even centuries following a large impact (Figure 3), and that  tens of meters of water may precipitate from the atmosphere and melt from the subsurface as a result of this warming (Figure 4, with results of our model runs for 100 km, point 1, and 200 km, point 2, diameter objects indicated). Data from the Pathfinder landing site indicate [8] that erosion rates were 103 - 106 times higher 3.5-4.5 billion years ago than they are today. These high erosion rates suggest the presence of a highly effective erosional agent that was active in the past, the most likely candidate for which is water.  However, for Mars to possess substantial liquid water on its surface requires higher surface temperatures than today. The CO2 greenhouse models([9], and others) require 1-5 bars of CO2 for surficial liquid water depending on the solar luminosity. At the solar luminosity expected early in the history of Mars, 5 bars of CO2 probably is not sufficient even considering CO2 clouds [10]. Furthermore, with such large amount of  CO2 in the atmosphere, along with liquid water on the surface, we would expect that carbonates would have formed but there is little or no evidence for carbonates [11].This research demonstrates that meters of water may flow across the surface of Mars due to the effects of a mid-sized impact, during a period of time too brief to allow formation of carbonates. Unlike greenhouse atmospheres, impacts have clearly occurred, and are capable of supplying enough energy to raise substantial parts of the regolith above the freezing point.
