 ROCKS OF ANDESITIC COMPOSITION AT THE MARS PATHFINDER SITE REVEAL CHEMICAL ANALOGY WITH SUBDUCTION-RELATED ANDESITES OF EARTH. O. V. Nikolaeva and A. M. Abdrakhimov, Vernadsky Institute, Moscow 117975, Russia. abasilevsky@glasnet.ru; Subject: for Nikolaeva According to McSween et al.1, Mars Pathfinder andesite composition2 is most similar to terrestrial anorogenic (subduction-unrelated) andesites (icelandites), rather than to orogenic (subduction-related) andesites. Using other datasets for terrestrial rocks provides the quite opposite conclusion. Introduction. The first analyses (APXS) of the chemical composition of the boulders, besides the soils, in the Mars Pathfinder site showed that analyzed rocks were distinctly different from those of soils, but similar to each other2. Rock compositions, when recalculated on adhering dust-free base2 and plotted on the classification total alkali-silica diagram3, revealed andesitic composition2. This Mars Pathfinder Andesite (MPA) is not necessarily igneous rock2. Its chemistry, however, is consistent with fractionation along trend from terrestrial tholeitic basalt melt in terms of any of standard discrimination diagrams (AFM after4, FeO*/MgO vs SiO2 after5, and K2O vs SiO2 after 6). So the composition of the MPA (or its igneous protolith1) may form primarily by fractional crystallization of basaltic melt, as the majority of terrestrial andesits do7. Terrestrial tholeitic basalts ( and, hence, their andesitic differentiates) are chemically different, depending on tectonic setting of their formation, and they form in all of the major tectonic settings: at plate margins (both convergent and divergent) and within plates (both oceanic and continental)7,8. The MPA shows lowAl, low-Ti, and high-Fe composition2. Terrestrial andesites from convergent settings (subduction-related or orogenic andesites) have distinctively low content of Ti, their low-Al tholeitic varieties are Fe-enriched; andesites from other settings (subduction-unrelated or anorogenic andesites) are consistently enriched in Fe and Ti and depleted in Al7,8. Based on the data reviewed in7, McSween et al.1 did not find similarity of the MPA composition2 to those of orogenic andesites, but found strong similarity to anorogenic andesites from East Galapagos Spreading Center (EGSC), based on the data reviewed in9. We tested this by using other datasets. Data and results. For orogenic andesites, we eliminated continental arc rocks that have higher Ti and total alkali contents7,8, than in the MPA2, and used the fresh rock analyses from the geochemical database of the rocks from Oceanic Island Arcs (OIA)10. For anorogenic andesites from EGSC, we choose the fresh glass analyses from the data sources referred in 9. Shown in Fig.1 is the variation diagram for the MPA composition as compared to EGSC and OIA tholeitic rock compositions. As it is seen, the MPA is chemically similar to both EGSC and OIA andesites in the K, Na, Ca, and Mg contents, but there is a full similarity to neither EGSC, nor OIA andesites. Compared to the MPA, high-Fe andesites from EGSC are significantly richer in Ti, while high-Fe andesites from OIA are slightly poorer in Al. The differences are more expressive in calculated normative mineralogy plotted on the diagram ATF (Fig.2) showing position of the MPA relative to differentiation paths for OIA and EGSC tholeites. OIA basalt fractionates to andesite (toward A) with slight decreasing in Fe norms (F) at nearly constant Ti norms (T), while EGSC basalt - from N-MORB-type basalt to ferrobasalt with drastic increasing in Ti norms and then from the high-Ti ferrobasalt to andesite with decreasing in both Fe and Ti norms. In the experimentally determined EGSC path9, high-Fe andesites were even still much richer in Ti than the observational (Fig.1). The EGSC andesites formed in propagating rift11 - one of the settings of anorogenic andesite formation. Representative examples from other anorogenic series with andesites (Pacific-Antarctic middle-ocean ridge12, Foundation oceanic seamounts12, Iceland oceanic plateau13,14, Columbia River continental flood basalt province15, and Afar continental rift16) were plotted (but not shown here) on the diagram and revealed the same Ti norms jump as the EGSC path. As it seen in Fig.2, andesite composition along EGSC-type fractionation path is necessarily richer in both Fe and Ti than the andesite composition with the same A value along OIA low-Ti path which is known to be distinctive for all orogenic rocks7. As a result, it is not possible to reach Fe-rich but Ti-poor andesite composition, like the MPA one, following the EGSC path. Therefore, contrary to McSween et al.1, we conclude that the MPA composition is not consistent with the EGSC fractionation path through ferrobasalt, as anorogenic andesites do, but instead is well consistent with the fractionation path of orogenic OIA tholeites. So, the MPA composition is most similar to those of tholeitic andesites from OIA of Earth in their fundamental peculiarities. Only Al content is slightly lower in the MPA composition (Fig.1). It is not clear why. One possibility is that more oxidised conditions of differentiation may be on Mars than on Earth. However, calculations using COMAGMAT program17 indicated that increase in fO2 to WM buffer does not approach, but goes away the MPA composition from those of OIA andesites (Fig.1).

We tested it using observational data on weathering of basaltic glass to palagonite at temperature close to 0Â°C in Iceland18. We plotted element content in palagonite rim divided by the content in initial glass in order of alteration maturity (Fig.3) and found that there is an interval of maturity when altered glass is depleted in Al and enriched in Fe, that is, changed in such a way to close the MPA composition to those of fresh OIA andesites (Fig.1). We prefer this possibility. Implication. On Earth, chemical peculiarities of subduction-related basalts - parental for orogenic andesites - are due to the peculiarities of their mantle source which was modified by crust-mantle recycling7,8. Found similarity in distinctive chemical characteristics between the MPA and terrestrial subduction-related andesites could imply that the MPA composition was ultimately determined by some type of martian crust-mantle recycling, not necessarily by plate tectonics mechanism.
