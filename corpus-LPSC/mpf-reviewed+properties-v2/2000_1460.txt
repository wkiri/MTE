 SILICA MOBILITY DURING SURFICIAL PROCESSES ON MARS.  Scott M. McLennan, Department of Geosciences, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, 11794-2100, USA (Scott.McLennan@sunysb.edu).  Introduction:  The mobile nature of silica during low temperature surficial processes on Earth is apparent from the common occurrence of sedimentary silica deposits, quartz veins, silcretes, quartz overgrowths and replacements in sedimentary rocks and the common depletion of silica in soils.  This is in spite of the fact that crystalline quartz is not particularly soluble under most near surface conditions.  Accordingly, sedimentary silica is largely derived from the breakdown of other silicates (e.g., feldspar, amphiboles, olivine, pyroxene) and glass during low temperature processes, pressure solution during compaction and creep, as well as a variety of diagenetic and metamorphic reactions during high pressure and temperature conditions. For Mars, the issue of near surface silica mobility has received scant attention.  There is wide agreement that a variety of sedimentary processes have affected the Martian surface and a number of workers have recognized that silica may play a role during alteration (e.g., [1-4]).  For example, Burns [1] proposed the possibility of "hydrous iron oxide - silica deposits" in the Argyre and Hellas basins and some models of the Martian hydrological cycle predict significant amounts of sedimentary silica [3].  However, evidence of significant silica deposits at or near the Martian surface has been inadequately explored. The question of sedimentary silica on Mars is of considerable importance for a variety of reasons.  Mobility of silica during surficial processes would significantly constrain hydrological models. Surprisingly high SiO2 contents of rocks found at the Pathfinder site have proven perplexing but generally have been interpreted in terms of igneous processes.  There is some question, however, as to whether the chemistry of Pathfinder rocks are best interpreted as being sedimentary in origin [5].  In either case, the presence of secondary silica phases would severely constrain any interpretation of these rock compositions.  Finally, silica dust is a well known health hazard [6] and perhaps as little as 0.1% quartz in Martian dust could severely limit human exploration of Mars [7]. Low Temperature Silica Mobility in Basalt Terranes: Analyses of SNC meteorites and Martian rocks and soils and general understanding of planetary evolution indicate that magmatic rocks on Mars are dominantly mafic to ultramafic [8].  Alteration of terrestrial basalt across a broad range of open system conditions, from weathering to hydrothermal, is commonly accompanied by loss of large amounts of SiO2 mainly due to the dissolution of unstable mafic minerals and glass [e.g. 9-12]. During weathering of basalt SiO2/Al2O3 ratios may decrease by as much as 50% in the most altered part of weathering profiles [11].  This degree of silica loss is comparable to that expected from weathering of more evolved granitic rocks [e.g., 13] but differs in that silica loss during basalt weathering occurs more during early stages of weathering whereas it occurs during later stages of weathering of granitic rocks (Fig. 1).  -60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0% C ha ng e S iO 2/A l 2 O3 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Chemical Index of Alteration  (CIA) Toorongo Granodiorite (Nesbitt & Markovics, 1997) Baynton Basalt (Nesbitt & Wilson, 1992) Basalt Granodiorite Fig. 1.

McLennan  Palagonitization of basalt is a commonly proposed process for the Martian surface.  On Earth, silica is typically very mobile during such processes.  An instructive example comes from the palagonitization of Icelandic basaltic glass taking place at very low temperature during interaction with meltwater and meteoric water having very low dissolved solids [12].  In this example, SiO2/Al2O3 ratios are decreased by as much as 60% in both palagonite and altered clays, compared to the parental glass (Fig. 2). Evidence for Low Temperature Alteration of Martian Basalt: Chemical relationships among Martian rocks and soils are consistent with a significant non-silicate secondary mineralogy.  At the Pathfinder site, MgO (and possibly FeOT) correlate positively with SO3 and Cl, suggesting that a significant fraction of the Mg in soils is present as sulfate and chloride minerals [14-17].  It is also generally agreed that much of the iron in Martian surficial deposits is present as secondary oxide minerals such as nanophase oxides, hematite and maghemite [2,18,19]. Chemical data are also consistent with fractionation of iron rich phases (e.g., hematite, Fe-sulfate) in Martian soils and rocks, likely during sedimentary transport [17]. The significance of these relationships is that they provide strong indirect evidence that silica was mobile during surficial processes.  The most likely source of Mg and Fe is from alteration of mafic minerals that reacted to form these non-silicate minerals.  Accordingly, simple mass balance suggests that there is a likelihood that substantial amounts of SiO2, also derived from these alteration reactions, would be available to form discrete sedimentary silica phases, including non-crystalline or crystalline opals, microcrystalline quartz (e.g., chalcedony) or quartz.  The amount of silica that could be produced is difficult to estimate with confidence but an upper limit of about 17% of altered material can be calculated that in turn would translate into a lower value for the overall Martian surface.  Silica Cycle near the Martian Surface: The ultimate fate of silica is also difficult to constrain because little is known about the nature of the Martian hydrological cycle over geological history.  Among the critical questions are the fluid/rock ratios, water chemistry, and the degree to which the systems are open to transport away from the site of alteration.  Near alteration zones, silicon may combine with aluminum (from plagioclase) and various cations to form palagonite and a variety of clays (e.g., saponite, nontronite, sepiolite, montmorillonite, etc.).  However silica that is lost to near-surface waters could be transported considerable distance and precipitated as  a separate silica phase, that could range anywhere through the spectrum from amorphous silica through to crystalline quartz .  Thus silica could be found in a variety of geological settings, including sedimentary chert deposits (iron formations of Burns [1]?), veins, fracture fillings, mineral overgrowths, encrustations on rock surfaces, silcretes, authigenic  mineral grains, or dust coatings.   The presence of significant amounts of silica would have important implications for interpreting imaging, remote sensing and chemical data that have been returned from Mars.  To date quartz has not been identified from the various spectroscopic methods and limited mapping by the thermal emission spectrometer (TES) restricts quartz to less than about 5% in the regions mapped [20], a value that is not inconsistent with the constraints discussed here. Perhaps the most significant implication of the possibility of sedimentary silica is that it leaves open the question of whether the high silica contents of Pathfinder rocks could have an origin that is fundamentally unrelated to igneous petrogenesis.  If Pathfinder rocks are of sedimentary origin then silica phases could constitute a fundamental component of the rock.  On the other hand, if Pathfinder rocks are indeed of igneous origin, high silica abundances could be related to an occurrence as vein fillings or various types of surface coatings. Even a minor surficial silica component on the rocks could  have an undue influence on the APXS chemical results and is not entirely inconsistent with the spectral data [21].
