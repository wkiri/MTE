Neutron data from Mars Odyssey allow the determination of hydrogen stratigraphy in the framework of a simple 2-layer model, for latitudes equatorward of ±50°.  On average, hydrogen is buried under a desiccated layer of thickness ~10 g/cm2 and a water-equivalent hydrogen (WEH) mass fraction in the 1% to 5% range. True hydrogen content of the Martian regolith below this relatively desiccated layer is 2 to 4% higher in mass fraction of WEH than minimum estimates from 1-layer models [1]. The model is described and results are presented for various nearequatorial regions.   Neutron data sets. The GRS suite of instruments onboard Mars Odyssey [2,3,4] has acquired neutron data for two Martian years.  The data reduction scheme for the Neutron Spectrometer component of GRS, conducted by two independent teams, yields an unprecedented set of thermal (0 - 0.3 eV), epithermal (0.4 eV - 0.7 MeV) and fast (0.7 MeV - 10 MeV) neutron maps with ~1% accuracy equatorward of ±50° latitude. The spatial resolution of the data is 600 km. The calibration of neutron data is absolute [5,6], using the measured growth of the CO2 seasonal cap, which eventually saturates the fast-neutron counting rates.  Model of hydrogen stratigraphy. A two-layer model can be used to determine hydrogen stratigraphy after correction for variable atmospheric thickness.  The topmost relatively desiccated layer is assumed to hold Y% WEH by mass, has a thickness of D in g/cm2, and the lowest layer extends infinitely deep with a WEH mass fraction of X%.  The model could formally be constrained by the three measured neutron energy ranges if the soil composition is known. Three composition cases have been simulated [5] with differing concentrations of Fe and Cl (both are strong thermal neutron absorbers): basalt with 15.4% of Fe and 0.01% of Cl; andesite with 12.2% of Fe and 0.32% of Cl; Pathfinder-soil [7] with 17.5% of Fe and 0.55% of Cl.  Results for D=0 have been given in the literature [1] using a pathfinder soil composition yielding a map of minimum WEH.  Equatorward of ±50° latitude, WEH mass fractions range between 2% and 15%.  Two large reservoirs with WEH concentrations larger than 6% are at antipodal longitudes: one centered on Arabia Terra, longitude +25° East, from the equator to latitudes ±30°, the other between the equator and latitude -30° south, at longitude +185° E.                 Figure 1: 2°x2° thermal neutron data points, as a function of water-equivalent hydrogen (WEH), as determined from epithermal neutrons under the assumption of a semi-infinite model (D=0).  Models are for different soil composition (see text).  Two-layer model simulations of counting rates have been performed using MCNPX [5]. The soil composition has a relatively small effect on the intensities of epithermal (4% max) and fast (5% max) neutrons, regardless of WEH abundance.  However, it has a large effect on thermal neutron counting rates, as shown in Fig. 1 for three model compositions.  Thermal neutrons therefore provide one additional measurable for more than two additional unknown parameters, the abundances of Fe, Cl, and their stratigraphy.  Nevertheless, epithermal and fast neutrons alone, can be used to constrain 1-D burial depth models, e.g. by choosing the composition of Pathfinder.  To illustrate this capability, measured epithermal and fast neutron counting rates are overlaid in Fig. 2 on a grid of burial depths (D parameter) and WEH compositions  (X parameter) for assumed WEH contents of the topmost layer of Y = 2% and 5%.  Inspection of these and other such plots show that the water content of the dry layer is less than Y =5% but greater than 1%.  For the region of Mars equatorward of ±50°, mean values of Y are about 2% and those of D are about 10 g/cm2.                              Figure 2: (top) 2°x2° fast and epithermal neutrons (in count rates) for different burial depths and several mass fractions of WEH in the lower layer of the model. The dry layer has Y=2% of hydrogen. (bottom) Same as above with Y=5%.  Regional studies. A systematic examination of surface regions having reasonably homogeneous compositions is in progress. A few preliminary examples are presented next.   Arabia Terra. D ~12 g/cm2 and Y =2.6%.  Y is in the range of 1.5-4% as observed by the Omega instrument onboard Mars Express. The water content X lies between 8% and 15% (see figure 4).   Viking 2. D ~10 g/cm2 and Y =0.6%.  Y is near 1% as observed by Viking lander.  The water content X ranges from 12% to 30% as a function of latitude. Gusev crater. D ~10 g/cm2 and Y =2.2%. The water content X ranges from 7% to 12% as a function of latitude.  10° North of Olympus mons. The top dry layer is thin, D ~0 g/cm2 and X =3 to 8%. Thermal neutrons show a possible composition bias that would yield lower WEH concentrations. Cereberus (160° E, 5° N). One of the driest places on Mars at the resolution of the Neutron Spectrometer, Y = X ~2% with D undefined.                Figure 4. Burial depth determination for Arabia Terra. WEH is determined using a semi-inifinite model. However, comparison with the simulations in Fig. 2 shows from the slope that D ~12 g/cm2 and the cross-over with the semi-infinite model (1:1 line) yields Y =2.6%.   Path forward. Neutron data, when they are absolutely calibrated, allow the extraction of hydrogen stratigraphy, to the extent that the soil composition of Fe and Cl is constant and preferably known over areas of investigation.  Techniques to infer this composition are being explored using neutron maps of macroscopic energy-loss and absorption cross sections: fast over epithermal neutron count rates and fast over thermal rates, respectively (see, e.g., [9]). Cl and Fe concentrations will be inferred from recent γ-ray maps [8]. The model must also explicitly output the stratigraphic layering of the Cl and Fe concentrations as well as the penetration depth of neutrons, which depends on the WEH content and its stratigraphy, to account for the soil depth that is truly probed by the neutrons.
