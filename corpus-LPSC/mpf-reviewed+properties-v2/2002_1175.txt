Introduction:  The composition, thickness and age of a planetary crust provides fundamental information about the magmatic, tectonic, and thermal history of a planet, and the timing and processes of crust-mantle differentiation. Little direct information about the age or structure of the crust on Mars is available, although geophysical and geochemical data collected by spacecraft missions and carried by martian meteorites provide essential clues to the nature and origin of the crust on that planet. Estimates for the composition and thickness of the martian crust have been derived from geochemical and geophysical observations. Norman [1] used a mass balance model based on Nd isotopic compositions and REE abundances in martian meteorites to estimate an average global crustal thickness of ≤45 km, with an optimum value of 20-30 km. Recent geophysical models based on gravity fields and topography determined by Mars Global Surveyor derived somewhat greater crustal thickness values of ~50 km [2] and 30-100 km [3]. McSween [4] acknowledged that these estimates are consistent within their respective uncertainties, but suggested that better agreement between the geochemical and geophysical models could be obtained if the martian mantle had a significantly more depleted Nd isotopic composition than previously assumed. Specifically, the Nd mass balance model [1] assumed a martian mantle with ε143Nd = +21.3 at 0.2 Ga, the age of Shergotty [5,6], whereas McSween [4] suggested that the initial Nd isotopic composition of martian meteorite QUE94201 (ε143Nd = +46.7) may be a more appropriate choice. This paper investigates the implications for the composition and thickness of the martian crust using a revised mass balance model in which the martian mantle is assumed to have a significantly more depleted Nd isotopic composition. Summary of the model: Details of the mass balance model and input parameters have been described previously [1]. For the revised model presented here, the depleted mantle is assumed to have ε143Nd = +46.7 rather than +21.3, and the crust has a density of 2900 vs. 3000 kg m-3. The LREE-enriched crust is assumed to have ε143Nd = -20 at 0.2 Ga [5,6]. These isotopic compositions imply that 70% of the total Nd in Mars is in the crust and 30% is in the mantle, which allows the relation between crustal mass (and therefore volume or thickness) and Nd concentration (ug/g) to be calculated (Fig. 1). The composition of Shergotty (ε143Nd = -7; Nd = 4.5 ppm) is assumed to represent a mantle-derived magma that became contaminated with crust prior to eruption [5,6]. The uncontaminated mantle-derived magma is assumed to have 1.5 ppm Nd and ε143Nd = +46.7, i.e. the composition of QUE94201 [7]. Nd concentrations of the crustal component are varied until the isotopic and elemental compositions of the mixture match that of Shergotty at a given fraction of crust in the mix. This crustal Nd concentration is then compared against the curve shown in Fig. 1 to derive an estimate for crustal thickness. 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 20 40 60 80 100 120 Nd crust ppm Crustal thickness km Nd mantle = +47.6 Mars crust Thickness vs. Composition εFig. 1.  Plot showing the relationship between thickness (km) and Nd concentration (ppm) of the martian crust implied by a mass balance model assuming a martian mantle with an ε143Nd like that of meteorite QUE94201 (+47.6). A crust with 8.5 ppm Nd (Fig. 2) would correspond to a thickness of 85 km. Results: The mixing models converge on the composition of Shergotty for a crustal endmember with 8.5 ppm Nd (Fig. 2). A crust with this composition would have a globally averaged thickness of about 85 km (Fig. 1). Uncertainties are difficult to estimate but allowing a latitude of  +  1ε  unit in the isotopic composition of the mixture produces a range of about +  10 km in the inferred crustal thickness. These results would indicate that Shergotty is composed of 40-45% enriched crust and 55-60% mantle-derived basalt.  Thickness and composition of the Mars crust:  M.D. Norman Discussion: If the average martian mantle is as depleted as implied by the Nd isotopic composition of QUE94201, the thickness of enriched crust on Mars could be considerably greater than that inferred previously by the Nd mass balance model [1]. The results of the current model would imply that Mars is extensively differentiated with an enriched crust that accounts for nearly 7% of the planetary mass. This would make the martian crust much larger proportionally than the continental crust on Earth (0.5% of the silicate mass), and comparable to the anorthositic lunar highlands crust which constitutes 9.2% of the mass of the Moon [8]. An average crustal composition with 8.5 ppm Nd can be produced by 89% batch melting of a primitive martian mantle [1], analogous to average terrestrial MORB. -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 -10 -5 0 5 10 del Nd ppm del     Nd Crust Nd 5 ppm 8.5 ppm 10 ppm Sh erg ott yShergotty εFig. 2. The composition of Shergotty (4.5 ppm Nd, ε143Nd  = -7.3) modeled as a mixture of mantlederived basalt with 1.5 ppm Nd and ε143Nd  = +47.6, and enriched crust having ε143Nd  = -20 and variable Nd concentrations as shown by the labeled curves. The combined Nd concentration and isotopic composition of Shergotty is best fit by a crustal component with 8.5 ppm Nd (del = 0). Del = absolute difference between the composition of Shergotty and model values. The average crustal thickness of 85   +   10 km inferred here would be in better agreement with the geophysical models [2,3]. However, such a great thickness of enriched crust may pose other problems. If the martian crust has average K, U, and Th abundances similar to those derived for surficial sediments by Mars Pathfinder data and orbital gamma ray spectroscopy, an 85 km thick crust appears unlikely as it would contain >100% of the planetary radiogenic heat production [9]. Even if the average crust contains lower concentrations of heat-producing elements compared to the surficial sediments, an 85 km thick enriched crust would still contain virtually the entire planetary budget of heat production and incompatible elements [3, 9]. The martian mantle composition assumed by the previous Nd mass balance model (ε143Nd = +21.3 at 0.2 Ga) [1] was based on mixing solutions which show that the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of several martian meteorites, including Shergotty and EETA79001, lie along a common hyperplane trend, and therefore could be related by 2-component mixing [5, 6]. However, QUE94201 does not fall along the same trend [7], so the assumption that it represents an appropriate mantle-derived endmember for Shergotty is not necessarily justified. In addition, incorporation of such a large fraction of crust (40-45%) into the Shergotty parental magma may not be petrologically reasonable. Alternatively, the martian mantle may be isotopically heterogeneous, with different domains contributing to basaltic volcanism. Conclusions: Crustal thickness estimates based on geochemical models do not necessarily have to agree precisely with geophysically defined crustal thickness because mechanical "crust" can be composed of both LREE-enriched (negative ε143Nd) and LREE-depleted (positive ε143Nd) material. The diverse compositions of martian meteorites suggest that the crust of Mars probably contains both geochemically enriched and geochemically depleted components which may be indistinguishable geophysically. This scenario suggests a multi-stage formation of the martian crust in which early planetary differentiation produced a LREE-enriched crust possibly averaging 20-30 km thick as inferred previously [1]. Subsequent basaltic magmatism may have been derived from depleted mantle sources, but contributed to the mechanical strength of the crust [3]. Most of these later additions of basaltic crust probably occurred at >4 Ga to account for the preservation of ancient impact craters [3]. If early Mars was relatively wet, basaltic volcanism during this time could provide excellent settings for production of altered 'oceanictype' crust and suitable environments for evolution of chemotrophic lifeforms.
