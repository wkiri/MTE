Abstract - We are analyzing Superpan multispectral data to investigate past environments at the Sagan Memorial Station (SMS), as they are recorded in the mineralogy and spatial distribution of rock coatings. It is known from earlier work on Mars Pathfinder results that rocks' surface composition is correlated with their visible color, with redder rocks having a more drift-like elemental composition [1]. This has been interpreted to indicate that rock surfaces are reddened by a thin, adhering coating of drift. Reddened rock surfaces also exhibit a shoulder at 600 nm much stronger than in drift, and strength of this feature increases with the rocks' red/blue reflectance ratio. This cannot be explained as a lighting or spectral continuum effect, or an effect of grain size of adhering drift. The preferred interpretation is presence of a ferric mineral in rock coatings which is absent or less abundant both in the drift and in uncoated rock. One possible origin of this mineral is in situ alteration of adhering drift. Approach Calibration of  Superpan data was refined as described by [2]. We calculated red/blue reflectance ratio and strengths of bands at 530 and 900 nm, and the shoulder at 600 nm (Fig. 1; corresponding to RB1R, BD530a, BD900, and BD600 of [3]). The 600-nm shoulder was used as a measure of an absorption near 660 nm which is difficult to measure directly, because the reflectance peak of rocks varies from 670 to 800 nm. Covariance between the parameters was analyzed to determine the spectral variability in the scene and its relationship to geologic setting. Comparison of Rocks and Drift With increasing red/blue ratio, rocks generally exhibit increasingly drift-like properties (Fig. 2). The drift has a high red/blue ratio and a strong 530-nm band. There is little evidence in most drift for bands due to crystalline minerals near 660 and 900 nm that have been reported from telescopic studies [4]. However, many rocks do exhibit a shoulder at 600 nm, which could result from overlappping visible and NIR ferric absorptions (Figs. 3 and 4). Strength of the 600-nm shoulder is not globally correlated in rocks and soils with 530-nm band depth, demonstrating that it measures an independent spectral feature. On rocks, but not drift, strength of this shoulder increases with red/blue ratio. The different relationships between red/blue ratio and strength of the 600-nm shoulder clearly separate even quite red rocks from drift (Figs. 3 and 5). The shoulder is strongest in the reddest rocks on which coatings "hide" the substrate, showing that it originates from properties of the coating and not the underlying rock. The presence of a strong 600-nm shoulder on redder rocks cannot be explained solely due to an areal mixture of drift on "clean" rocks with a low red/blue ratio. Neither is the shoulder likely to be an effect of the negative spectral continuum created by a ferric coating on dark rock, because the continuum should either be neutral in effect or actually suppress a shoulder [5]. The 600-nm shoulder cannot be explained by a greater grain size of the same ferric mineral as in the drift, because the 530-nm band present in drift is weaker on the coated rocks. Variations in illumination also cannot be responsible, since the 600-nm shoulder is unchanged across boundaries in lighting geometry (Fig. 3). The simplest explanation for the stronger 600-nm shoulder in the rock coatings is occurrence of a ferric mineral that is either absent or less abundant in uncoated rock and in drift. Several ferric minerals do exhibit features generally consistent with the inferred mineral [6], but the relative strengths of different absorptions does limit the range of candidates. The 530nm band is weaker on rocks than it is in drift having a comparable red/blue ratio (Fig. 2), inconsistent with crystalline hematite which has a strong 530-nm band. Goethite, which has a very strong 660-nm absorption, is consistent with the ~6% increase in the 600-nm shoulder without development of a clear band near 900 nm. Discussion If they are analogous to orange desert varnishes [7], rock coatings at SMS would be composed of adhering drift plus a cementing agent formed diagenetically in the coating. A similar mechanism for formation of Martian rocks coatings was proposed by Bishop [8]. In her model, dust adheres to rock and is altered nearly isochemically by thin films to monolayers of liquid water, forming new ferric minerals. This model is consistent with the elemental compositions measured at SMS, and it offers an explanation for the greater abundance of the ferric mineral responsible for the 600-nm shoulder on coated rocks than in drift.
