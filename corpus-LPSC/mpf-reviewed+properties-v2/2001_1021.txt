GET THE RED OUT:  REMOVING DIFFUSE SKY ILLUMINATION FROM MARS PATHFINDER IMAGES Carol Stoker and Kathy Rages, M.S. 245-3 NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, cstoker@mail.arc.nasa.gov, krages@mail.arc.nasa.gov Martian scenes are illuminated not only by direct sunlight, but also by sunlight that has been scattered by dust particles in the atmosphere creating diffuse skylight. There was enough atmospheric dust at the Pathfinder landing site to produce ~0.5 optical depths of extinction and to contribute ~30% of the total illumination[1].  The color of the sky varies markedly with position, and varying solar illumination can cause spurious color perceptions for surface features.  For example, the rock called Yogi appeared consistently bluer on whichever side was facing the sun in any given image [2,1].  In order to present an accurate picture of color variations on the Martian surface, it is highly desirable to remove the effects of diffuse illumination from the sky to create a "no atmosphere" rendering of the surface features. The total light intensity reaching a lander's imaging system from a particular point on the surface at a particular wavelength is (assuming Mars' curvature can be neglected) is In practice, the integration is carried out using an addingdoubling code with R and T defined at discrete points (Gauss points) in µ and µ0, and using the Fourier components of R and T in azimuth. To remove the effects of diffuse illumination from the Martian sky on the surface scene, models of both the diffuse transmission of sunlight through the atmosphere and reflection from the surface are required.  To compute the atmospheric transmission matrix T for the times of the observations, we use the values reported by [3] for the particle size, complex refractive index, and optical depth of the dust in the atmosphere over the Pathfinder landing site. The calculations must also account for "dust" refractive index, particle size, and optical depth varying with time of day due to the condensation of water ice clouds in the atmosphere [4] and the increase in dust optical depth from 0.4-0.5 to ~0.6 over the several months of Pathfinder observations[4,3].  Calculating the light scattered into the camera from each point on the surface requires knowledge of the scatter phase function of the surface.  For our initial corrections, we use the values published in [2] which were derived without information about the 3-D shapes of the scattering surfaces.  We use three-dimensional models of the terrain derived from stereo images using the methods described in [5] on 670 nm stereo images to compute a set of position vectors, associated surface normal vectors, and corresponding values of  µ and µ0  for each pixel in the images.  Using these, in conjunction with the image time and ephemeris information, we perform a scattered light calculation for each pixel in the images. We verify the method for the color correction using images of the radiometric targets on the Pathfinder lander. The targets are flat surfaces with three rings of material (white, grey, black) having known reflectance and nearly Lambertian scattering properties[6]. We will show results for a radiometric target and for mulispectral images of  the rock Yogi as they would appear if there were no dust scattering in the atmosphere.
