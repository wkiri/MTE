A final release (Version L) of the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) Precision Experiment Data Record (PEDR) has been submitted to the Planetary Data System (PDS). Additional gridded data record products are forthcoming. These products have evolved since their original description, owing in part to improved gravity modeling and cartographic reference frames, and in part to refinements in calibration. An additional component, the 1064 nm narrowband radiometry data, is also being archived. These data will be invaluable for future studies by Mars explorers and scientists. MOLA altimetry [7] commenced in northern latitudes shortly after orbit insertion in September, 1997, and continued during the Science Phasing Orbits starting in March, 1998. By March, 1999 the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft (MGS) attained a 400-km circular mapping orbit and MOLA operated nearly continuously for 1.25 Mars years [5], obtaining near-global altimetric coverage. Data products were released at roughly 6 month intervals after acquisition, allowing time for calibration and crossregistration. In the elliptical aerobraking orbits it soon became apparent that orbital and pointing uncertainty were often greater than mission requirements in the face of limited tracking. An extensive crossover adjustment has been applied to correct the majority of errant tracks to within 1-m accuracy, providing near-perfect registration. Shaded-relief digital terrain models from MOLA now bridge the gap between historical and MGS wide-angle images and MOC narrow-angle images, and provide context for Mars Odyssey investigations. The PEDR profile data are now being re-released in their entirety, with several changes described below. Initial Experiment Gridded Data Records were generated at resolutions of up to 32 pixels per degree, with few gaps. The final Mission Experiment Gridded Data Records (MEGDR's) are now provided at 64 and 128 pixels per degree globally, with lower resolution products as well. Densities as high as 512 pixels per degree are available in a polar stereographic projection. The most noticeable change in the current release is the adoption of the IAU2000 rotation model and cartographic frame [4] recommended by the Mars Cartography Working Group, based on Viking and Pathfinder tracking [1], as well as a determination of the position of landmark crater Airy-0 by Viking Cameras, MOC and MOLA.The orientation of the prime meridian (W0) at the epoch J2000 (Ephemeris Time) went from 176.868 �to 176.630 �, a change of 0.238 �in longitude. Adoption of the current standard will allow registration of images and profiles globally with an uncertainty of < 100 m. The second significant change involves the topographic reference datum, subtracted from planetary radii to yield equipotential topography. Originally described by a degree-4 potential model [6] for an earlier USGS topographic model, we now understand that the equipotential surface that corresponds to terrestrial "sea level" has over 1 km of lumpiness with respect to an ellipsoid of revolution. While this change does not affect the fundamental planetary radius data, accurate knowledge of height with respect to this surface is required to assess the influence of topography on dynamic processes. The current potential model GMM3, updated from GMM2-B[2] is based on tracking from the entire MGS primary mission as well as extended mission data through July 2001, and selective incorporation of altimetric crossovers, with tracking equations generated in the IAU2000 reference frame. One effect of this change has been to reduce slightly the measured topographic height of Olympus Mons by 20 m, an artifact of better resolution of its gravitational bulge by mgm1025, but overall, the topographic changes shouldn't warrant geological concern. 180˚ 240˚ 300˚ 0˚ 60˚ 120˚ 180˚ -60˚ 0˚ 60˚ mgm1025 - mgm0964c20 5 m contours (+) 5 m contours (-) Figure 1: Change in reference equipotential surface mgm1025 (GMM3), degree and order 50, from interim model mgm0964c20, or GMM1.6, shown in simple cylindrical projection. Differences are greatest at high northern latitudes, where modeling of antenna and solar panel motion was inadequate, and over large volcanoes, where gravity power is high. Root mean square difference is 3 m, with excursions of up to 27 m. MOLA pulse widths have been recalibrated using in-flight data, and a robust algorithm applied to solve for the surface optical impulse response. This measurement samples the roughness of terrain on a footprint scale of 100 m or less, and is of vital interest for future landing mission planning. The recalibration also includes improvements to the centroid correction algorithm (range walk correction) for saturated pulses that accounts for varying detection thresholds. A large computational effort has been expended in improving the accuracy of the MOLA altimetry themselves, both  MOLA ARCHIVE STATUS: G. A. Neumann et al. in improved orbital modeling and in after-the-fact adjustment of tracks to improve their registration at crossovers. The Version L milestone incorporates over 80 million crossovers into the solution, with empirical parameters (3 at each time point) accounting for radial, along-track, and across-track errors. In the first iteration, 250,000 parameters were used to adjust for twice-per-rev variations. After two more iterations with 1 million parameters, distributed so as to roughly equalize the number of crossovers used to constrain each parameter, a final solution with 2 million parameters was obtained. This solution reduces the root-mean-square crossover residual from 1.85 m after iteration 1, to 1.4 m [3]. The adjustment model is sufficiently dense at the poles to account for wavelengths as short as 30 km, while typically at least 150 crossovers constrain each time point. Slightly noisy results are sometimes obtained at the edges of valid nadir passes, but the improvement in the polar regions is remarkable. Lastly, the MOLA detector is operational and collecting radiometric data at 1064 nm. The calibration of these data, for the mapping and extended missions, is complete and an archive scheme has been reviewed by the PDS. Seasonal changes in the reflectivity of the polar caps can be monitored with a resolution of about 300 m per pixel. References [1] Folkner, W. M. et al., Science, 178, 1749-1751, 1997.
