Introduction:  Surface-atmosphere interactions are among the most dynamic processes that modify the Martian crust. Wind-blown sediment transport is a dominant surface-atmosphere process on Mars, which has been active throughout Mars' past [1-2] and is an active agent in resurfacing the planet [3-5]. Our ability to determine the conditions under which wind-blown sedimentary strata formed, and the timescales over which wind-blown landscapes and surface features, such as wind streaks, ventifacts, yardangs, ripples, and dunes form, depends on how well we can determine rates of aeolian resurfacing.  Determining these rates relies on our understanding of the frequency at which sediment moves on the surface of Mars, which in turn, relies on estimations of the wind speeds necessary to mobilize sand; a speed cited as the fluid threshold for sand transport.  The fluid threshold of motion for aeolian sand transport marks the initial entrainment of sand particles by the force of the wind. This is typically defined and modeled as a singular wind speed for a given grain size and is based on wind tunnel observations [6-13] These empirical models can vary by Â±50% for any given grain size population, Figure 1, largely due to different experimental definitions of initial grain movement and disparate methods for deriving the threshold [14]. For example, gradually increasing the wind speed over a sandy surface results in a gradation of movement beginning with the movement of single particles to intermittent bursts of transport to continuous motion of the bed. In his seminal experiments, Bagnold defined the threshold of motion when he observed that 100% of the bed was in motion because that was the only repeatable method to define threshold. Following Bagnold, 100% of the bed in motion has been used to define the threshold [8-9] while others used 50% and lesser values [15].  Iversen and White (1982) define the threshold as continuous motion throughout the bed.  These threshold observations inherently imply some degree of transport occurs before the empirically derived threshold is reached.  Methods: Here we use a wind tunnel and novel sediment trap to capture the fractions of sand in creep, reptation and saltation at Earth and Mars pressures.  Each mode of transport is captured in sand traps and subsequently analyzed for grain size distributions.  A vertical profile of velocity and saltating particles are observed along with visual observations of threshold exceedance collected via video to correlate the number of particles in motion to the visual percentages of the bed in motion. Threshold shear velocities are calculated from 15 second averages of velocity at each height above the surface via Law-of-the-Wall.  Results: We show that the threshold of motion for aeolian sand transport is best defined as a continuum, rather than a singular point, in which grains progress through stages defined by the number of grains in motion. We propose the use of scale dependent thresholds modeled by distinct probability distribution functions that differentiate the threshold based on micro to macro scale applications.  For example, a geologic timescale application corresponds to a threshold when 100% of the bed in motion whereas a sub-second application corresponds to a threshold when a single particle is set in motion. We provide quantitative measurements (number and mode of particle movement) corresponding to visual observations and degrees of transport intermittency for Earth and Mars.  Conclusions: The results of our experiments suggest aeolian transport can occur well below current predicted thresholds on Mars. It is advantageous to incorporate the threshold as a scale dependent parameter that corresponds to different mangtidues of movement on Earth and Mars. Understanding transport as a continuum provides a basis for revaluating sand transport thresholds on Earth, Mars and Titan.
