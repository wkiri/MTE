The data are viewable via the World Wide Web certify spacecraft landing sites on Mars. Constraints on at http://wireless.jpl.nasa.gov/RADAR/Mars/. robotic landings on Mars include: terrain elevation, Landing Site Selection: New datasets other than radar reflectivity, regional and local slopes, rock radar offer some of the site selection information distribution and coverage, and surface roughness, all of provided by radar in the past. However, radar data still which are addressed by radar data [1]. Indeed, the retain certain strengths. A critical element of NASA's usefulness of radar data for Mars exploration has been future robotic Mars exploration is roving, and rover demonstrated in the past. Radar data were critical in trafficability on the surface becomes a key landing site assessing the Viking Lander 1 site [2, 3], and more selection criterion.

The older data (MOLA) instrument on Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), provided local elevation information for Mars (ranging- the importance of Earth-based radar to provide Mars only data), along with radar scattering information with elevation and regional slope information with ranging global resolution (Doppler-only or continuous-wave is diminished.

MOLA data may provide some surface roughness collected during the 1988, 1990, 1992-93, and 1994-95 information, and would certainly profit from a careful Mars oppositions. Much of this Mars data since 1990 and direct comparison with the better-understood radar has not been analyzed beyond a cursory examination of results in different regions.
