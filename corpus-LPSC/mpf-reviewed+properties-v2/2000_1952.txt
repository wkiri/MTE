Introduction: The scientific objectives of the APXS on the Pathfinder mission to Ares Vallis in July, 1997, are to determine the geochemistry and infer the petrology of the rocks and soils at the landing site. The Pathfinder landing site is possibly a floodplain created from waters catastrophically emanating from southern Ares and Tiu channels. Geomorphic features such as streamlined islands, undulating ground, and strewn angular boulders at the site support this floodplain hypothesis [1].  The Pathfinder APXS is described by Rieder et al, 1997 [2]. The alpha backscatter mode is particularly sensitive for measurement of C, N, and O. Measurement of these light elements is important for the estimation of the abundances of nitrates, carbonates, and excess oxygen (from hydrated minerals) which may be present [3]. The proton mode provides redundant information about the light elements with high (α,p) production cross section: Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and N. The X-ray mode determines the abundances of all major elements above and including sodium in atomic number. The three systems can be used independently but it is the combination of all three modes that provides in some cases complementary and in other cases redundant information and results in accurate and complete chemical analysis. Preliminary examination of the Pathfinder APXS data has led to several significant geological interpretations: 1.) that the rock surfaces analyzed have coatings, to varying degrees, of Martian dust, 2.) that the "dust" component may be algebraically subtracted in order to reveal the compositions of the underlying rocks, 3.) that the rock compositions so revealed are uniform, 4.) that the rocks are more silica-rich than typical terrestrial basalts, 5.) that there is less than 0.5 atomic % carbon in the rocks and soils, and 6.) that the Pathfinder soil is very similar in composition to the Viking fines. The inferred dust coatings are exceptionally rich in magnesium and sulfur, and contain significant amounts of chlorine, posing a puzzle as to the origin of this material. There are several areas in which improvements can be made in the Pathfinder APXS data analysis, which may alter the geologic implications. It will be possible to extract useful chemical data from the alpha scattering part of the experiment, which has not yet been done due to interference of atmospheric CO2 scattering. These results are essential for the analysis of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and important for corroborating the X-ray analyses. The X-ray analyses will also be improved by further calibration in a CO2 atmosphere.  Calibration:  The chemical analyses of the APXS samples at the Pathfinder site have been challenging due, in part, to an interference in the alpha spectra from the Martian CO2 atmosphere. This interference is not constant, but varies with diurnal pressure and temperature (due to density variation). Also, it varies with the distance of the APXS sensor to sample during the operations on Mars. The X-ray analysis is affected much less and it is better understood and easily corrected. The effect of the Martian atmosphere on the Xray mode is to lower the intensities by absorption of outgoing X-rays from the sample in the Martian gas. Laboratory measurements comparing the intensities of standards in vacuum to those in Martian atmosphere agree extremely well with absorption calculations of outgoing X-rays in the gas. The only significant effect of the Martian atmosphere on the proton spectra is to introduce a proton signal from atmospheric nitrogen. Using a Martian gas mix of 95.32% CO2, 2.7% N2, and 1.6% Ar [4] by volume, we have measured the small contribution to the proton data from the atmospheric nitrogen.  There are two general effects of the Martian atmosphere on the alpha spectra. The first effect is a shift in the endpoints for each element. This effect is due to a lower average alpha energy striking and returning from the sample due to slowing of the alpha particles in the Martian gas. The second effect is to introduce three distinct peaks from the carbon and oxygen in the Martian gas. The large magnitude of these atmospheric peaks as well as the shifting of the spectral endpoints is illustrated in figure 1.

N. Foley, T. E. Economou, W. Dietrich, and R. N. Clayton  We have modeled the contribution of the Martian atmosphere to the alpha spectra in the laboratory. A beryllium target was placed in the laboratory APXS and its alpha spectrum was collected for various pressures covering the number density of atmosphere on the Martian surface during the Pathfinder measurements. This study revealed three distinct peaks in the alpha mode from atmospheric CO2. The two lowest energy peaks are due to backscattered alpha particles from atmospheric carbon and oxygen nuclei respectively. The highest energy peak is due to low-angle scattering from oxygen nuclei close to the alpha detector.  Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the atmospheric peaks and increasing pressure. These curves were fit with a function as indicated. The parameters include the amplitude, center, and width for each peak covarying linearly with number density. Also shown in figure 2 below is the atmospheric spectrum from sol 22 which was collected while the APXS was pointed over a rock toward the horizon. As expected for sol 22, the atmospheric peaks each broaden on the low energy side of the respective peaks due to an increase in return alpha backscatter particles from a greater distance.   Figure 2: Experimental and Modeled Atmosphere               The validity of the general peak parameters determined in the laboratory is qualitatively supported by the spectra from sol 22. The predictable nature of the three peaks is vital. Figure 1 shows that the only atmospheric peak visible in the spectrum of a typical geologic sample or a Pathfinder rock or soil sample is the carbon peak. Using the carbon peak's amplitude, center, and width, the parameters for the two oxygen peaks were computed. The resulting atmosphere-free spectrum is also shown in figure 1. This type of subtraction was used not only to remove atmospheric contributions from rock and soil analyses, but also to derive the standard calibration library for each element and/or oxide examined in the laboratory under Martian conditions. Analyses of an andesitic geologic standard are shown in table 1. The X-ray mode results listed were computed using intensities derived from calibration targets as well as elemental biases determined from the analyses of five geologic samples under Martian conditions. The raw X-ray intensities were also corrected for peak asymmetries. The X-ray error is a minimum estimate of the instrumental error from counting statistics alone. All oxides more abundant than 1 wt% measured with the X-ray mode agree with the conventional values when compared on a dry basis, by re-normalization of the conventional values without LOI and H2O+. The alpha/proton results rely on the X-ray mode for only a first approximation of the MgO and P2O5 values as well as the K2O/CaO ratio.

Conclusions:  The alpha/proton mode results are compromised by the atmospheric peaks, as illustrated by the somewhat lower accuracy of the alpha/proton mode in table 1. Yet, importantly, the two modes give similar results for major elements. The data collected from the alpha mode will be useful to validate the Xray mode abundances for the Pathfinder rocks and soils. Also, it will provide an estimate of the amount of carbon, nitrogen, and absolute oxygen in the Pathfinder samples. The raw Pathfinder alpha spectra reveal very little, if any, sample carbon and nitrogen. Preliminary alpha analyses using the same atmospheric removal technique described above, however, yield excess oxygen [5]. To verify the accuracy of this excess, more laboratory experiments will be done under Martian conditions in this compositional range.  References: [1] Golombek M. P. et. al.
