Introduction:   Shergotty consists of ~65% pyroxene, ~25% maskelynite and ~2% whitlokite and~2% titanomagnetite (and ilmemite). About 0.6% of its mass  is made up of in-situ produced shock-melt [1,2]. In few localized regions of some thin sections, irregularly-shaped dark-brown melt products (<1mm in size) are present [2]. Note that we analyzed two thin sections USNM #321 and #GMS)  and did  not find any glassy melt pocket for microprobe studies.  During this survey we obtained a small chip (few mgs in weight) of a Shergotty glass inclusion where large abundances of Martian noble gases were found by [3] and  with this chip, a thick section (referred to as DBS) is prepared for electron microprobe studies at JSC.  Also we got another smaller chip from the same Shergotty glass parent with which another thick section (referred to as EGS) was prepared.  In EGS we failed again to locate any melt glass pocket.  But DBS thick section yielded a good glass pocket.  It shows that impact melt glasses are not common in Shergotty. Similar to glass inclusions in [2], maskelynite and other accessory minerals are present near the glassy regions in DBS, though the melt products are located near pyroxene grain boundaries.  Occasionally glassy melt seemed to penetrate into fractures of pyroxene grains. The minerals close to the melt area exhibit smooth boundaries.  These features  indicate incipient melting in Shergotty glass in contrast to large scale advanced melting in the case of EET79001,Lith C [2]. A BSE image of the glassy melt inclusion in  Shergotty  DBS section  is shown in Fig.1. The melt products in Shergotty glass are relatively heterogenous in texture compared to the melt glass veins in EET79001,Lith C [4,5]. This may partly be due to incipient melting in Shergotty.  These melt regions consist of fine grained poly-crystalline matrix in which micron-sized sulfur-associated bubbles seem to be imbeded.  In Lith C veins , we found the density of  these  globules near the central region of the vein relatively high [5].  But such feature was not observed in Shergotty melt glass. Quantitative chemical analysis was performed by both raster beam and point mode with Cameca SX 100 microbeam automated electron microprobe at JSC, Houston using 15 KV accelerating potential and 20 nA beam current.  Standard analytical methods are employed for determining 12 element oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, FeO, MgO, TiO2, MnO, Na2O, K2O and SO3, P2O5,Cl).  Digital WDS imaging of S, P, Fe, Na, Ca, Si, Al, Mg and Cl was carried out in selected areas in glass to study their spatial distribution. The totals for the microprobe data are generally 100Â±1%. The Shergotty glasses, analyzed here as well as by [2] are relatively heterogeneous in composition compared to EET79001,Lith C samples [5].  This may be due to differences in equilibrium shock pressures experienced by these two meteorites i.e. the very localized in-situ melting (incipient stage) observed in Shergotty compared to the advanced stage of localized whole-rock melting in EET79001.  The probe data for these elements obtained in our samples and those of [2] show significant variations from sample to sample. The elemental composition in Shergotty glass indicates that the melt products represent mixtures of pyroxene, maskelynite, phosphates and ilminites together with some K-and  S-rich phases.  In elemental sulfur maps, we note that part of sulfur is associated with K- rich areas whereas some of it seems to be associated  with Fe.  Some areas show well preserved Cl-apatite grains in the glass. The data obtained for a given area in the DBS section (average of  6-8 traverses) are normalized to the Shergotty bulk composition [7] and the results are plotted as histogram in Fig.1. The melt-product data for samples #1 & #3 given by [2] are similarly normalized and plotted in Fig.1 for comparison.  Note we have not plotted Cl and P2O5 data intentionally in Fig.1.  The Cl and P2O5 contents in DBS are 0.3% and 5.34% respectively which are similar to glasses  #1 & #2 of [2]. In contrast, melt #3 of [2] has very little chloroapatite. The distribution of these accessory mineral phases in Shergotty glass is not uniform.  Sample DBS and melt-glasses  #1 & #3 of [2] do not show Si depletion relative to Shergotty bulk except for meltglass #2.  DBS showed modest enrichments of Al and Ca and depletion of Fe, Mg, Ti and Mn with respect to Shergotty bulk.  But in this sample Na, K and S showed significant enrichments.  In the case of meltglasses #1 & #3, Al, Fe, Mn, Na and K did not show much variation with respect to Shergotty bulk whereas Ca and Mg showed some variation.  In contrast to these Shergotty glasses, all glassy  EET79001 samples analyzed by us [5] yielded fairly uniform composition. They showed modest enrichments of Al, Na, K and Ca and minor depletions of Fe, Mg and Ti but uniformly large enrichments of  S in all the samples.  These reMolten Martian soil in Shergotty:  M.N.Rao  et al. sults indicate that the EET79001 melt glasses are relatively homogeneous compared to Shergotty glasses. But in all the these cases, S showed enormous enrichments with respect to Shergotty bulk.  Also meltglass #2 of Stoffler et al.[2] showed very large enrichment of S ( by a factor of ~7) with respect to Shergotty bulk.  The range of S enrichment in Shergotty glasses is by factors of 2 to 8 whereas that in EET79001 glasses is by  factors of  3-4 [5].  Note in most of these cases Fe is either depleted or normal with respect to the bulk composition. As in the case of EET79001 glasses, the large enrichments of sulfur in Shergotty glasses cannot be generated by  partial melting of Shergotty bulk material during impact.  Addition of extraneous material such as sulfur-rich Martian soil to Shergotty glass pockets is required.  This addition has to necessarily take place before the occurrence of impact, that produced the glassy melt. The SO3 content of  Mars soil (Pathfinder) is ~ 5.2% [6]. If ~10 to 20% of Pathfinder-type Martian soil was added to the precursor material in Shergotty glass, before the impact, the large S excesses in  Shergotty melt glasses can be easily explained., Note that some elements in Shergotty glasses cannot be quantitatively accounted for by proportionate mixing models as in the case of  EET79001 glasses because Shergotty glass composition is found to be heterogenous compared to EET79001, Lith C samples.  These results suggest that similar enrichments of  S may be present in other shergotite glasses. REFERENCES: [1]. E.M. Stolper and H.Y. McSween, Jr. (1979) GCA, 43, 1475-1498. [2] D. Stoffler et al.
