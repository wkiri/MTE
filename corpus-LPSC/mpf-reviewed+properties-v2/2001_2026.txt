Introduction:  The martian surface is covered with a layer of fine dust and sand whose origins are unknown.  The wind-blown fines of Mars have high concentrations of salt-forming elements that are easily released from rocks and mobilized by water [1,2].  Since the history of water on Mars and its past climate are of intense scientific interest, the question of the origin of the martian soil bears strongly on some of the great mysteries of the planet.  Here we report on preliminary results of laboratory experiments that produce dilute brines from the interaction of water with Marsanalog rocks and a simulated acidic Mars paleoatmosphere. On Earth the vast mobile-ion reservoir is the ocean, continually fed by dilute (and compositionally diverse) solutions from rivers and streams.  Steady state ocean abundances are both higher and fractionated relative to their input, a condition resulting from balance with various loss processes [3].  On Mars, what remains from epochs of a more vigorous hydrological cycle is its salty soil.  The extent of this surficial unit is unlike anything on Earth, being possibly the detritus of a lost ocean or the stored products of globally extensive rock/volcanic acid interactions in the geologically recent past [4].  The composition, mineralogy and depositional sequence of the martian soil unit may ultimately tell us if and when liquid water ran on its surface, how much there was, and where it went. The uniformity of this surface layer on Mars is striking.  Both Viking Lander sites and the Mars Pathfinder site in Ares Vallis are apparently covered in fine particles that are about 16% salts [5].  In the case of Viking, compositional analyses were carried out by Xray fluorescence spectrometry.  These measurements indicated that the soil is about 3% S, 0.6% Cl, and 0.3% K [5].  With the Mars Pathfinder mission a mobile elemental analysis lab was emplaced at the surface, enabling a better discrimination between mobile and rock unit compositions.  Bulk salt-forming elemental abundances of the martian fines are about the same at Ares Vallis as they are at the Chryse and Utopia Planitae [6].  Still, it is one of the great frustrations of Mars surface science that no mineralogical analysis has been possible to date, and few trace element compositions have been determined.  This may change with the use of more sophisticated instruments such as an X-ray diffraction/XRF spectrometer and the promise of revealing the history of Mars' early water [7]. Approach and Experimental Technique:  In order to shed light on the unique aqueous geochemistry of Mars, we have been conducting laboratory experiments in which we allow an SNC-derived mineral mix to react with pure water under Mars-analog atmospheres.  In 1999 we completed a 7-month experiment in which we measured the composition, formation rates and temperature dependence of dilute brines formed under a gas mixture that simulated the present Mars atmosphere [8].  Surprisingly the S/Cl ratio obtained in these dilute brines was about 4, similar to value of 5 found in situ for the martian soil.  However, cation ratios in our simulated brines were distinctly non-martian.  So in April 2000 we began a second series of experiments in which the headspace of the reaction vessels contained a CO2 atmosphere with an admixture of 100 ppm SO2, 100 ppm HCl, and 10 ppm NO2.  We report here on the initial results of the aqueous alteration of Mars-analog rock forming minerals under an acidic Mars-analog atmosphere. Samples of unaltered mineral mixtures, chosen on the basis of SNC meteorite mineralogy [9], were ground, sorted, and mixed with doubly distilled water. The slurries were placed in a 1 bar environment at 3째 and 25째C in order to represent conditions within the martian subsurface where brines might reside. Samples are collected after durations of 1, 21, 42, 84, 168 and 336 days.  Upon extraction, the identity and abundance of water-soluble ions in the fluid are determined and the rock samples are examined for the presence of precipitates and weathering products.  Anion concentrations are determined to ppb levels using a Dionics 4500I Ion Chromatograph (IC) using EPA 300 protocols.  Cations are also determined at ppb levels with an ARL 3410 Plus Inductively Coupled Plasma/Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP/AES), following the EPA 6010 protocol.  Controls of two types are also performed during the experiment: (a) chambers with fluid and Mars-analog minerals with Earth atmosphere in the headspace, and (b) chambers with fluid, no rock, but with Mars-analog gas in the headspace. Experimental Apparatus:  Great care has been taken to design and build a robust set of environmental chambers that will maintain experimental vessel integrity and provide effective flow-through of reactant (Mars-analog) gas mixtures.  Three environmental chambers, one for each temperature, have been fashioned out of polycarbonate gloveboxes (only two are used for the present experiment).  The chambers are instrumented with temperature and pressure sensors and active computer-controlled feedback circuits to  MARS AQUEOUS CHEMISTRY:  M. A. Bullock, J. M. Moore, and M. T. Mellon  maintain gas pressures in the chambers as well as in the individual experiment vessels.  The gloveboxes themselves are filled with CO2 and periodically purged with it.  36 vessels reside in each glove box, and are filled and periodically purged with the Mars gas mixture.  Temperature is controlled in the gloveboxes with thermostatic recirculating cooler/heaters, which circulate fluid within massive aluminum pallets.  All vessels are seated within deep depressions in the pallets.  Tools and aliquot extraction supplies are passed into and out of the gloveboxes via airlocks. Results to Date:  The experiments began on April 19, 2000 and will continue for one year.  To date, aliquots at 1, 21, 42, 84 and 168 days have been extracted.  The primary anions in solution are carbonate, sulfate and chloride, in the range of 1 - 300 ppm after 6 months.  Cation concentrations are similar, with contributions from calcium, magnesium, aluminum and sodium.  Decreases in Cl- and Ca2+ are observed near 4000 hours at both temperatures, most likely due to a precipitating phase.  SO4 2- abundances increase dramatically over time, and are continuing to increase due to re-supply of SO2 in the vessel headspace.         Figure 1.

The top two plots show the results obtained at 3째C, the bottom ones are for 25째C.  The dashed line and right hand axes show solution pH.  We will discuss the implications of these results for the formation of the martian soil and make comparisons with the results of our first experiments and the Mars Pathfinder APXS data and Mars Global Surveyor TES results.
