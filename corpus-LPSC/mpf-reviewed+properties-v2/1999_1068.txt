SALT WEATHERING OF VOLCANIC ROCKS WITH XENOLITH INCLUSIONS: AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION TO "CONGLOMERATE" AT THE PATHFINDER LANDING SITE. G. Komatsu1,2 and K. Righter2, 1International Research School of Planetary Sciences, Universita' d'Annunzio, Viale Pindaro 42, 65127 Pescara, Italy (goro@sci.unich.it); 2Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, U.S.A.     Mars Pathfinder provided images of Mars' surface. The boulders at the landing site are generally rounded and many of them are imbricated, which are perhaps the result of flood transport [1]. The rock surfaces are often rough and pitted. Existence of conglomerate is argued based on images showing socket and pebble-like (0.5 to 3 or 4 cm in size) morphology on some rock surfaces [1] (Figure 1). We propose salt weathering (or tafoni weathering) of volcanic rock with xenoliths as an alternative hypothesis for the rock surface morphology.     Salt weathering has been proposed to explain the rough and pitted rock surface near Pathfinder landing site [2]. On Earth, salt weathering is a major process in decomposing a range of hard rock types, including basalt, andesite and granite. Here we show some examples of tafoni weathering (mainly salt weathering) on lamprophyric basalt from the Mexican Volcanic Belt in Jalisco, Mexico (Figure 2). This PlioQuaternary lava flow is alkaline in composition (~9 wt% total alkalis; Table 1), contains augite, apatite and biotite phenocrysts, sanidine (alkali feldspar) in the groundmass, and small (0.5 to 10 cm) cumulate xenoliths (Figure 3). In some cases, the xenolith grains resemble the pebblelike features in the Pathfinder images. Although there are some differences between the bulk composition of this basalt and rocks analyzed at the Pathfinder landing site including a calculated soil-free rock (Table 1), such as higher K2O and lower FeO and possibly SiO2, there are also similarities in MgO, CaO and Na2O.     Tafoni weathering occurs both as physical and chemical processes [3]. The physical process includes expansion of minerals by the temperature fluctuations, and also the growth of halite from the accumulation of soluble NaCl with moisture. The halite, in particular, has a very large thermal expansion coefficient. This leads to the loosening of the rocks. If the supply of the salt-rich moisture is abundant, the chemical weathering becomes more important. The rocks saturated with moisture lead to the chemical weathering of biotites and feldspars within a boulder. As a result of suction from the evaporation on dry days, the solutions which have reached the surface cause a hardening of the intergranulars, on and near the surface, by iron hydroxide and silica. The chemically weathered and now softened rock material breaks through from behind the hard weathering crust and leaves the tafoni hollows. In some cases, the rock surface pattern produced by the tafoni weathering (Figure 2) resembles the socket-like morphology at the Pathfinder landing site.     Salt weathering is a possible process under the current Martian environment [2], and this could have been even more prevalent during the wetter periods of Mars. Volcanic rocks with xenolith inclusions are petrologically plausible in terms of Martian magma evolution. For instance if volcanism on Mars is dominantly hotspot driven [4], then we should look for hotspot terrestrial analogues. Indeed, there are many xenolith-bearing volcanic rocks in such hot-spot localities (Hawaii [5]; Tahiti [6]). Therefore, we consider that our interpretation of the socket and pebble-like rock surface morphology is a viable alternative to the conglomerate hypothesis.
