Overview: Wind is the dominant agent of surface modification on Mars in the current environment, as evidenced by active dust storms and abundant wind-related surface features observed from orbit and the ground. Quantifying aeolian processes requires knowledge of the near-surface wind regime, including wind speeds and surface shear stresses. Values for such parameters are determined from measurements of the wind velocity profile near the surface, but such direct measurements are lacking on Mars, other than those obtained from the "wind sock" experiment on the 1997 NASA Mars Pathfinder lander[1]. Consequently, derivation of information on near-surface winds is achieved indirectly through observations on Mars by the movement of active sands of known sizes, coupled with laboratory experiments of the winds needed to move such sands.  Observation: In 2007, the Mars Exploration Rover, Spirit, remained in one position from sol 1250 to sol 1291 on the east scarp of a polygonal-shaped feature named Home Plate in Gusev crater. Dust storm activity was high during this time and operational activities were restricted to conserve power. However, front Hazard Avoidance Camera (Hazcam) images (Fig. 1) taken on sol 1260 and sol 1265 show that a ripple crest had moved about 1.5 to 2 cm toward the southeast (azimuth 220o), presumably under the influence of nearsurface winds. The observed direction of movement is approximately consistent with wind directions based on previous analyses of aeolian features[2]. Although no Microscopic Imager (MI) frames were taken of the sands within the ripple, images were taken of sands within 0.5 m of the ripple. Of the 98 MI frames taken from sol 1250 to 1291, 18 frames contained useful information and the sands were found to average 218 µm in diameter, equivalent to fine sand (Fig. 2).  Anaylsis: The fundamental parameter in aeolian processes is the threshold friction wind speed, u*t [3,4], which defines the minimum wind conditions to set particles into motion and is a function of the wind velocity profile. Friction wind speed is related to surface shear stress by   ! " = u *t 2# = µ $U $z ,                                 (1)  where τ is the shear stress responsible for movement, ρ is the atmospheric density, µ is the absolute viscosity (dependent on temperature) and ∂U/∂z is the velocity profile with respect to height for aerodynamically smooth surfaces. Extensive experiments under martian atmospheric conditions have defined these conditions [5], leading to the establishment of  u*t versus particle diameter "curves" for various atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions on Mars (Fig. 3). Assuming a temperature of 250 K and pressure of 6.5 to 9.5 mb at Gusev crater, the threshold friction wind velocity for 218-µm particles ranges from 1.7 to 2.5 m/s. Measurement of the wind speed, U, varies as a function of the wind friction speed, u*, the aerodynamic surface roughness, z0, and the elevation above the surface, z for naturally rough surfaces:  ! U = u* "# ln zz 0$ % & ' ( )                                     (2)  u*t is used in the place of  u* to determine the wind speed, U, when the particles were in motion. The aerodynamic roughness marks the boundary between turbulent flow above this height and laminar flow below. Changes in z0 change the thickness of the laminar sublayer and influence how well particles can be lifted out of that region. Large nonerodible roughness elements remove energy from the airflow resulting in higher shear stresses (hence wind velocities) required for particle movement. In most cases z0 is about 1/30 the height of the roughness elements. The aerodynamic roughness has not been determined at the Home Plate site in Gusev crater, but has been estimated to be 0.1 to 1.0 cm at the Viking 2 landing site [5,6] and >3 cm at the Mars Pathfinder site[1]; because a qualitative assessment of the roughness suggests that the Home Plate site is smoother, we use z0 << 1.0 cm. The elevation above the surface, z, was calculated from the expression  ! z = 12 NE                                       (3)  in which NE refers to the average diameter of nonerodible roughness elements (such as rocks) in the upwind direction from the site of interest, and a rough estimate from Navcam images is 3.5 cm. Based on these values, the nearsurface winds speeds are estimated to have been at least 12 to 17 m/s within a few cm of the surface when the particles moved. In general, wind speeds increase with height above the surface, and these values would correspond to minimum speeds of 28 to 42 m/s at a height of several meters.  References: [1] Sullivan, R. et al.
