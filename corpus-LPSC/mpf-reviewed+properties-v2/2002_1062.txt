 BASALT OR ANDESITE?  A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF CONSTRAINTS ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE ANCIENT MARTIAN CRUST.  Harry Y. McSween, Jr., Department of Geological Sciences, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, mcsween@utk.edu.   Introduction:  Mars has a voluminous crust (average thickness ~50 km, comprising >4 vol. % of the planet [1]), which formed very early in the planet's history. This Noachian crust is pervasive, comprising not only the exposed southern highlands but also the covered basement in the northern lowlands [2].  Its ancient differentiation age is demonstrated by a high density of large craters, the 4.5 b.y. crystallization age of ALH84001, and by the U-Th-Pb systematics and former presence of extinct 146Sm in other, younger martian meteorites [3].  The full extent of layering seen in Mars Global Surveyor MOC images of the walls of Valles Marineris has been interpreted as lava flows [4].  If such layering were globally distributed, it would suggest that virtually the entire crustal thickness is volcanic in origin.  VISNIR spectra suggest that significant portions of the martian surface are composed of shergottite-like basalts [5].  The ultramafic composition of cumulate rock ALH84001, the only meteoritic sample of this ancient crust, is certainly not representative, but its derivation by fractionation of a basaltic magma is consistent with a mafic crustal composition.  Mars Global Surveyor TES has discovered that basalt dominates the ancient crust exposed in the southern highlands [6].  But TES mapping of huge expanses of andesite in the northern hemisphere [6] and analysis of rocks having andesitic composition at the Mars Pathfinder landing site [7] imply that significant portions of the crust may be siliceous volcanic rocks.  A critical evaluation of various lines of evidence, however, suggests that Mars may actually be a basalt-covered world. Mars Global Surveyor TES Spectra and Mars Pathfinder APXS Analyses - Another View:  Reinterpretation of TES spectra from the andesite terrain in the northern lowlands indicates that it might be equally well explained as partially weathered basalt [8].  This ambiguity arises because clay minerals are virtually indistinguishable from volcanic glass in TES spectra.  Although significant quantities of well crystallized clays are not indicated by ISM spectra [9], smaller amounts of poorly crystalline clays and amorphous silica are permissible.  A north polar projection of the distribution of materials interpreted as weathered basalt shows that they lie within a previously proposed northern ocean basin [10], which may support the interpretation of this material as basalt that experienced submarine alteration or weathered sediments transported into this deposcenter. The silica content of the global andesite unit, estimated from its deconvolved modal mineralogy as partly weathered basalt, is 50+5 wt. %.  This silica content is lower than the revised APXS composition (57+10% silica) of the Mars Pathfinder sulfur-free rock [11, 12],  but the two values are not distinguishable when analytical uncertainties are considered.  Thus it is conceivable that the analyzed surfaces of Pathfinder rocks may also be basaltic weathering rinds partly covered by dust.  The possibility that even the dust-poor gray rocks have altered siliceous coatings was suggested by [13] and is consistent with their photometric properties [14].  Thus, it seems plausible that martian rocks previously identified as andesite, based on measurements from orbit and on the ground, could actually be partially weathered basalt. Evidence from the Compositions of Martian Surface Fines:  Martian dust is thought to have been globally homogenized by winds, which may account for the compositional uniformity of soil deposits at sites separated by thousands of kilometers. Analyses of surface fines may provide a critical constraint on the compositions of the dominant crustal rocks from which they formed.  Originally, the compositional similarity between Viking soils and basaltic shergottites was cited as evidence that the soils formed from basalts.  Following the discovery of andesitic rocks by the Pathfinder mission, many workers have interpreted martian soil compositions as mixtures of materials derived from both basaltic and andesitic rocks [12, 15, 16].  Although surface soils at the Pathfinder site may contain small chips of the local  rock, the composition of the fine global dust derived from an assessment of Viking and Pathfinder soil data [17, 18] does not require admixture of andesite. Moreoever, compositional changes expected during chemical weathering of rocks (by palagonitization, hydrothermal alteration, or acid-fog reactions) suggest that the martian global dust could only have formed from basaltic protoliths [17]. Evidence from the Assimilation of Crust by Shergottite Magmas:  Except for ALH84001, all martian meteorites are too young to be samples of the ancient crust and probably represent later plume magmatism.  However, basaltic shergottite magmas have assimilated varing amounts of an ancient crustal component, as indicated by correlations between initial radiogenic isotope compositions (87/86Sr, 143/144Nd, 176/177Hf), rare earth element fractionations, and redox state [19, 20].  Unfortunately, it is easier to deter MARS CRUST COMPOSITION:  H. Y. McSween, Jr.  mine the isotopic and trace element composition of this assimilant than its major element composition.  It is not even clear whether this crustal component was actually rock or perhaps fluid that scavenged solutes from the crust.  But if rock itself was assimilated, then this ancient crust must have had a basaltic composition, otherwise its silica content would have been affected.  There is no hint of increased silica abundance that correlates with increasing amounts of crustal assimilant, as would be expected if the crust were andesitic.  If 10% andesitic crust like the Pathfinder sulfur-free rock were assimilated (probably a minimum amount [21]), Shergotty's silica content should have increased by 1.5%.  The oxidized nature of this crustal component [20] may require that it was weathered. Evidence from Inferences about Martian Crustal Density:  To erupt on the planet's surface, ascending basaltic shergottite magmas had to penetrate the ancient crust, presumably propelled by a contrast in density.  On Earth, erupted basalts show a restricted range of molar Fe/(Mg+Fe) ratios, attributed to differences in the ability of fractionating magmas to ascend through the crust [22].  As basaltic magmas fractionate en route to the surface, their densities progressively decrease as olivine crystallizes and then pass through a minimum when pyroxene and plagioclase join the crystallization sequence.  Erupted magmas cluster at compositions that correspond to this density minimum.  The Earth's crust apparently acts as a density filter for melts passing through it, favoring the eruption of the least dense magmas.  Could the ancient martian crust likewise have acted as a density filter? Most SNC metorites are cumulate or phenocrystenriched rocks, but considerable progress has been made in assessing the compositions of shergottite and nakhlite parental liquids [e.g., 23, 24, 25].  Fe/(Mg+Fe) values and calculated densities for shergottite and nakhlite melts, as well as for their liquid lines of descent, have been calculated using the MELTS program.  Because of their higher Fe contents, martian magmas are denser than their terrestrial counterparts.  But like terrestrial basalts, all these erupted martian magmas exhibit a restricted range in density (2.80-2.85 g/cc) that appears to correspond to the minimum density encountered during fractionation [26].  The minimum density corresponds to a wider range of Fe/(Mg+Fe) than in terrestrial basalts, perhaps because of delayed entry of plagioclase during the crystallization of shergottites.  A denser (mafic) martian crust would impose a window of eruptibility for denser basaltic magmas.  New models of the relationship between gravity and topography using Mars Global Surveyor data suggest densities of 2.95-2.99 g/cc for the elastic lithosphere [27, 28].  Crust having this density, equivalent to basalt, would be an appropriate filter for fractionated shergottite magmas.  This density is significantly higher than that estimated for the Earth's crust (~2.75 g/cc), which is thought to have an average composition similar to andesite.  Conclusions:  Although the existence of andesitic crust on Mars certainly remains a viable hypothesis,  reinterpretation of the spectral and chemical data that undergird this idea and consideration of other lines of evidence suggest an alternative - that the martian crust predominantly has a basaltic composition.  Such a mafic composition is especially plausible if the ancient, voluminous crust crystallized from an early magma ocean, as suggested by early, synchronous differentiation of the martian crust and core [29].  A basaltic crust also removes the geologic difficulties encountered in explaining how a hemisphere of andesite formed.    References:  [1] Zuber M. T. (2001) Nature 412, 220-227.  [2] Frey H. et al.
