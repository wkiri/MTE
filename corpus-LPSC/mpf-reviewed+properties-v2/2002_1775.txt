Introduction: Recalibrated and geometrically registered multispectral images from the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) were analyzed using Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) and related techniques.  SMA models a multispectral image scene as a linear combination of endmember spectra, and anomalous materials which do not fit the model are readily detected as model residuals.  Most of the IMP data could be modeled using "Bright Dust", "Gray Rock" , and "Shade" image endmembers.  Analysis of the SMA fraction images indicated spectral differences within a previously monolithologic Dark Soil class.  A type of Dark Soil that has high fractional abundances in rock fraction images (Gray Rock Soil) was identified.  Other anomalous materials, detected through analysis of root mean square (RMS) error images resulting from SMA, included a previously noted "Black Rock" lithology, a class of possibly indurated, compacted, or partially cemented soils, and anomalous patches on at least one rock.  The Black Rock lithology has a strong 900 to 1000 nm absorption, and modeling of the derived image endmembers using a laboratory reference spectral library produced best-fit model spectra that are most consistent with the presence of  high-Ca pyroxenes, crystalline ferric oxide minerals, or mixtures of these materials as important components of Black Rock materials. Data Set:  We analyzed a recalibrated and geometrically registered version of the "Super Pan" data set, acquired using all 13 IMP bands (440-1000 nm) and covering most of the MPF landing site [1,2].  Version 3 of the IMP calibration algorithm (now implemented in the USGS software package ISIS [3]) was used to calibrate the images to relative reflectance using images of the radiometric calibration targets acquired close in time to a given Super Pan image sequence [4]. ISIS was used to compute the subpixel registration offsets among different bands for a given scene and camera eye.  The USGS geometric control network of the landing site was also used with ISIS algorithms to compute the appropriate map projection parameters [5].  Using a single pixel resampling, the registration offsets and projection parameters were simultaneously used to produce left- and right-eye multispectral image mosaics for each of the 8 separate image sequences ("octants" labeled S0181 through S0188) that comprise the Super Pan.  Left eye segments consisted of images acquired at 443, 671, 802, 858, 898, 931, 968; right eye segments were acquired at 443, 480, 531, 600, 671, 752, and 967 nm [6]. Data Processing and Analysis: To assess the degree of subpixel spectral heterogeneity, we applied spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to the image data. SMA identifies endmember spectra which can be used to model, by linear combination, the measured reflectance of each pixel in the scene. The endmembers used in this part of the analysis were image endmembers; i.e., averages of a small number of pixels taken to be the best, "purest" pixels of the material present in the scene [7]. Endmember identification was performed using a number of data visualization methods originally developed for terrestrial remote sensing applications [e.g., 8-10]. Alternatively, some endmembers or anomalous materials were mapped using the foreground/background analysis (FBA) technique [11]. FBA is an approach similar to SMA, but computationally different in that it does not necessarily produce abundances for single endmembers, but rather for endmember groups, namely the desired "foreground" spectra with undesired "background" spectra nulled out.  Like SMA, FBA produces fraction images in which the value of each pixel is related to the fractional abundance of the material (or group of foreground materials) in question.  Fraction images produced by FBA can have superior contrast between foreground and background materials because the approach is not restricted to using a single image endmember spectrum to represent each image endmember. Results: A small number of endmembers accounted for most of the spectral variability in each segment. In most image segments, we found that only three endmembers (Bright Dust, Gray Rock, and Shade) were required. However, as described previously [12], we used RMS residual images to identify a small number of anomalous materials occurring within the scene. These materials included "Black Rock" cobbles and pebbles similar to those first identified by [13] and having 1000 nm band minima at a wavelength longer than that of the IMP bandpass, "Intermediate Soil" of a possibly indurated or compacted nature, exhibiting a deeper 900 nm absorption band than normal Bright Soil [14], and "Spotted" patches on the rock called Desert Princess, exhibiting a distinct 900 nm band and higher reflectances at 671 through 802 nm than other units [14]. Representative spectra of these anomalous materials are shown in Figure 1.  SMALL SPECTRALLY ANOMALOUS MATERIALS AT THE MPF SITE:  J.F. Bell III et al. The best examples of the Black Rock lithology all occur among the smallest size fraction of rocks (cmsized cobbles and pebbles [2]). While other explanations are possible, this is consistent with these materials having been transported the greatest distances from the landing site by the Ares and Tiu Vallis outflow channel flood events. Another possibility is that these small anomalous rocks are allochthonous fragments of material ejected laterally by impact events. The "spotted" patches on Desert Princess could be vesicles filled with altered soil or dust, cobbles in a conglomerate rock, or perhaps even phenocrysts of differing composition. Unfortunately, the patches are near the limit of resolution of the IMP, and a search of the Sojourner rover camera image archive revealed no close-up rover images of this particular rock. Intermediate Soil is widely distributed in small, discrete patches. It is associated in several instances with larger occurrences of morphologically distinct "outcrops" of what appears to be indurated, compacted, or partially cemented soil.  These soil deposits generally exhibit a ~5% deep 900 nm absorption,  with an even deeper band occurring in the smaller occurrences  noted  in  the RMS error  images.  The smaller clusters with the deeper 900 nm band might be smaller occurrences of a mineralogically purer cementing agent like a ferric oxide/oxyhydroxide [17], which in the larger occurrences of Intermediate Soil is spectrally masked by other lower albedo sedimentary grains. These results reinforce the assumption that higher spatial resolution, well-calibrated multispectral imaging and spectroscopy investigations on future Mars lander and rover missions are likely to enable the identification of even more spectrally diverse but perhaps spatially rare rock and soil lithologies on Mars.
