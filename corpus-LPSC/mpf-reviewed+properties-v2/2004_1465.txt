These data are consistent with the findings of Ca sulfates and NaCl in Martian meteorites [11,12], and with Earth-based spectroscopic observations [13,14] tentatively indicating the presence of sulfates on Mars. Although the correlation of S and Mg in Viking and MP samples could reveal the occurrence of Mg sulfate [1-10], the mineralogy of sulfates and chlorides remains unclear. The hydration state of surface sulfates and chlorides is also unknown, which makes a long list of salts possible, as shown in Table 1. Taking into account likely aqueous origins of sulfates and chlorides [e.g., 7,15,16], periodic (seasonal and daily) presence of water ice condensates at a significant part of the surface, and recycling of mineral dust through polar regions could account for hydration of salts, at least at high latitudes and at depth [17]. Hydration of surface salts, which could account for up to 15-25 vol. % in Viking soils [7], could partially account for bound water in the regolith. In fact, from 0.5 wt. % to 4 wt. % of bound water is present in the soil based on ground [e.g., 13,18,19], Hubble Space Telescope [20], Mariner 6 [21-23] and Phobos 2 [24] spacecraft spectroscopic data in the near-infrared (3 µm), Mars Odyssey neutron spectroscopy [25], a Viking biological experiment [26], APXS analyses of soils and rocks at the MP landing site (based on "excess" oxygen) [4], and the clear absorption of bound water (6.1 µm) at the landing site of Spirit rover (Mini-TES data) [27]. Both hydrated silicates (e.g., zeolites, clays) and salts (sulfates, carbonates, chlorides) could be host minerals for Martian bound water. ri Mea da co st te fo sy soils and rocks, and evaluated composition for the soil-free rock [4]. In contrast to Viking data for soils [1], MP data reveal significant excess of Mg relative to S for both rock and soil samples [10]. The average MgO/SO3 mole ratio in rocks and soils of 2 to 2.5  indicate that more than half of the Mg atoms are not associated with sulfates. Only a minor amount of the "excess" Mg can be in MgCl2 [10] and the rest of the Mg could be in carbonates such as magnesite [10, 28], hydromagnesite and artinite [22], as well as in secondary (e.g., saponite, serpentine) and fine-grained magmatic silicates (e.g., olivine). Therefore, the strong correlation of Mg and S could be caused by addition of Mg-bearing minerals together with non-Mg sulfates rather than exclusively by addition of MgSO4 to fresh, soil-free rocks. The absence of positive Ca - S and K - S correlations in MP samples [3-5] indicates that sulfates of Ca and K are not abundant. A positive Fe - S correlation is not indicative for Fe sulfates [10]. However, Na2O correlates with SO3 in rock samples [4]. The linear fit of Na2O and SO3 molar ratios for rock samples gives a slope close to unity (Fig. 1). Similar molar amounts of Na2O and SO3 could reflect a predominance of Na2SO4 over MgSO4 in rock samples. The possibility of an associa Table 1.  Sulfates and chlorides that could be abundant on the Martian surface Magnesium sulfates: MgSO4, MgSO4·H2O (kieserite), MgSO4·5H2O, MgSO4·6H2O, MgSO4·7H2O (epsomite) Sodium sulfates: Na2SO4 (thenardite), Na2SO4·10H2O (mirabilite), Na2Mg(SO4)2·4H2O (bloedite) Magnesium chlorides: MgCl2·2H2O, MgCl2·4H2O,  MgCl2·6H2O (bischofite) Sodium chlorides: NaCl, NaCl·H O (hydrohalite) 2 Here we evaluate the mineralogy of sulfates and chlodes in rock and soil samples based on APXS analyses at the P landing site [2-5]. This work is aimed to complement rlier investigations [2,3,4,5,8,9,10] that reveal the abunnt occurrence of Mg sulfate mixed with mainly silicate mponents of soil and rocks. We also analyze the hydration ate of salts equilibrated with atmospheric H2O(g) at the mperatures of the MP landing site. Salt mineralogy: We examined correlations and perrmed balance calculations in the SO3-Cl-MgO-Na2O-SiO2 stem based on recalibrated MP APXS chemical data for Figure 1. Molar concentrations of Na2O and SO3 in MP samples [4]. The arrow represents the concentration trend caused by addition of Na2SO4 to the soil-free rock. tion between Na sulfates and weathering crusts of the rocks, as well as with soil and dust coatings on rocks is also illustrated in Fig. 2. The possible presence of Na2SO4 in the secondary mineralogy also implies the association of S and Na in soil samples. However in soils, the N2O/SO3 molar ratio is much lower than unity. This likely represents a predominance of Mg2SO4 over Na2SO4 in soils. The lack of clear positive correlations of Ca and K with Cl in MP soils [4,8] suggest low abundances of corresponding chlorides and the association of Cl mostly with Na and Mg. Since molar amounts of Cl (MCl) are significantly less  F  a ithan those for MgO (370-1100 % of MCl) and Na2O (120-460  % of MCl), Cl could be present both in Na and Mg chlorides. We were unable to infer any meaningful correlations to reveal the association of Cl in MP samples. For example, the Na-Cl correlation in rock samples could be caused either by addition of NaCl or by additions of Na2SO4 and MgCl2. Amounts of sulfates and chlorides in MP samples were evaluated by subtracting the composition of soil-free rocks (for Na2O we took 2.4 wt. %, see [3-5]) from H2O-free APXS data [4] followed by calculations of normative mineralogy and the "excess" amount of Mg that cannot be bound with S and Cl. In our models, Cl was associated with either MgCl2 or NaCl, Na was in Na2SO4 and NaCl, and Mg was in MgSO4 and MgCl2. These mole balance calculations show that the association of Cl does not strongly affect calculated abundances of Na2SO4 and MgSO4. In our nominal model shown in Fig. 3, Cl is present as MgCl2. The normative model demonstrates high abundances of Na2SO4 in the weathering products and coatings and the predominance of MgSO4 in soils. Since the presence of Na in the non-sulfate part of the secondary assemblage was not considered (except sample A16), calculated amounts of Na2SO4 give maximum concentrations.

At the average values for annual temperature and pH2O, MgSO4·H2O, Na2SO4 and MgCl2·6H2O are stable at the surface. In the summer seasons, MgSO4·H2O, Na2SO4 and MgCl2·H2O are stable; and in the winter seasons, MgSO4·7H2O, Na2SO4, MgCl2·2H2O and MgCl2·6H2O are stable. Because of inhibition of corresponding hydration-dehydration reactions at low-temperatures (except Na sulfates) [31], many of these salts could be present as metastable phases. At mean daily temperatures, Na2SO4·10H2O is stable in the winter season pole-ward of latitudes ~30o. However during winter nights, Na2SO4· 10H2O is stable at the MP landing site.

Throughout the year, kieserite, metastable epsomite in air-blown dust, and bischofite may contain much of the bound water associated with sulfates and chlorides. The stabilities of bloedite and hydrohalite remain to be explored. Note that the assemblage of stable hydrates is different at other latitudes [17] and elevations. Figure 2.

Summary: Secondary S is likely to be presented by Mg sulfate and Na sulfate, which is abundant in weathering crusts and rock coatings. Chlorine could be in Mg and/or Na chlorides. Magnesium sulfates and chlorides are likely to be hydrated, but Na sulfate and NaCl are probably anhydrous. Acknowledgements: This work is supported by NASA grant NAG5-7696. References: [1] Clark B.
