While MER used the Rock-Abrasion-Tool (RAT) on ~10 igneous rocks [2], MSL has a brush (DRT) as well as a drill [3], which has not yet been used on any unaltered rock.  In this paper, we discuss similarities of igneous rocks among landing sites, dust coverage, possible surface coatings and important elements that provide evidence for the degree of alteration of the samples.  Igneous Rocks at Gale: The first rock touched by Curiosity's arm was JakeM, which was characterized as a mugearite[4]. Since then two other rocks with virtually identical composition were found in 3 and 9 km distance and 350 meter elevation. The logarithmic ratio of 16 elements to the average soil/Mars composition is shown in fig 1. Beside over 10 similar floats, also felsic components were identified in conglomerates and as possible source rocks for extended sediments.                  Fig 1. Logarithmic ratio of 16 elements of as is rocks in Gale Crater.  Alteration or dust cover impact the APXS data. To estimate the extent, the APXS calibration target, vertically mounted on the rover's body, was measured before and after the 2018 global dust storm, which covered it with dust, fig 2. Especially for low z elements, which have an information depth of 2-5 μm, can be affected. S and Cl, enriched in dust and very low in the rock increase. The data indicate that the overall chemistry is not significantly impacted. The dust cover can be estimated to be ~ 30% areal coverage with 2 μm thickness. The data clearly advocate brushing targets whenever possible and to take caveats carefully.  While millimeter deep RAT abrasion on the Adirondack rock revealed low SO3 and Cl values down to             Fig 2. Logarithmic ratio for the clean and dusty calibration target. 1%, 0.2% respectively, often brushed surfaces still have elevated values enriched in soil, either indicating residual dust or a possible alteration rind [4]. A feasible process appears to be that micrometer sized dust, enriched in S, Cl and Zn, preferentially adheres over long times to the surface and ultimately reacts with the original rock surface, leaving much of the original character of the bulk composition intact. Besides low S, Cl content, suitable indicators for the unaltered character of rocks were found to be the Fe/Mn ratio of ~50, similar to soil, which is usually taken as average martian crust [5], as well as the low content of trace elements like Zn, Ni, Br and Ge. These high z elements have information depths of >50 μm, penetrating through a possible rind.     Gusev Crater: The Gusev Plains' rock population was dominated by mafic, primitive, olivine bearing rocks like Adirondack [4], plotted in fig 3. They are similar to the global soil. Notably different is the low S, Cl, Ni and Zn, likely in the amorphous phase of the soil [6], as well as the very low K in Adirondack. Alkalic rocks and bedrock like Wishstone, apparently igneous albeit highly enriched in P and Ti, and alkaline basalts like Backstay were found in the Columbia              Fig 3.

All likely igneous rocks follow the trend of Fe/Mn~50 and low trace element abundances.               Fig 4. Igneous rocks at Meridiani Planum      Meridiani Planum: Along the 10s of km traverse over the ~25% sulfate-bearing Burns fm, ejecta blocks were found, that fit other igneous rocks. Bounce Rock resembles the shergottite EETA79001B[8], Marquette is Adirondack like. Upon arrival at the pre-Burns rim of Endeavour Crater, rocks like Amboy generally resemble average soil, but have elevated Ni and Fe/Mn ~40. This could indicate a mixture of pre-impact material with some degree of alteration. Later, several felsic rocks were encountered. In Perseverance Valley, Allende was similarly felsic, while clearly setting it apart from Esperance in all alteration trends [9]. Fig 4. shows that all rocks have the Fe/Mn~50 and low trace element trends, with the exception of Marquette with ~300ppm Ni and Amboy. However, mafic soils in Gale Crater have even higher Ni, likely due to different Olivine composition [10]. With the andesitic rocks from Pathfinder [11], alkalic rocks were found at all rover landing sites.    Gale Crater: On sol 2015 climbing up Mount Sharp, Curiosity came across a Smorgasbord of small float rocks assembled in about a square meter. This area, dubbed Bressay, shows a notable diversity of compositions with many of the above discussed indicators for unaltered rocks, fig 5. Tyndrum is clearly JakeM like. Staffa is low in alkalis, high in Al and Ca, similar to Bounce Rock, while Hopeman is high in K with medium Ca, with both having lower Fe and low Ni, Zn. Sanquhar and Askival are high in SiO2 with ~65%. Minginish is high in K and Zn. In addition to the discussed indicators for igneous rocks, one can apply here additionally Ge as connection to the extensive Murray formation, which has ~100 ppm very consistently[12]. Minginish and Sanquhar have high Ge, while Askival has ~50ppm, so they might have seen similar but less alteration as Murray. In contrast, the rocks with igneous compositions do not have detectable <20ppm               Fig 5. Unbrushed Rocks at Bressay, Gale Crater Ge, which is consistent with basaltic martian meteorites (1-3 ppm) [13].      Summary and Discussion: Several elemental trends in the APXS data can be used as indicators for unaltered igneous rocks, even without brushing or abrading. These data provide significant supplemental information to other data like fine scale composition, mineralogy or texture.  S and Cl as reactive and salt forming elements are unique indicators for alteration if levels of the dust are exceeded or go up when brushed or abraded. Trace elements like Ni, Zn and Ge with >50 μm penetration depth and detection limits well below typically 100 ppm can reliably indicate alteration trends or the lack thereof. Interesting is the obvious higher potassium content of the alkalic rocks at Gale with 2-3% K2O, compared to 0.5-1% at the other sites. This is also reflected in the high content in sediments like Windjana ( ~3% K2O) or the ~1% in the large Murray formation [14].  The availability of relatively unaltered rock compositions from 4 landing sites on Mars fills in gaps in the constituents of the airborne dust and the Martian crust.
