In particular, the mapping of chemical elements at a global scale can provide a unique way to constrain the geochemical composition as a function of the geological units and time. Chemical analysis first derived from GRS/MO data revealed a surface dominated by basaltic crust with distribution rather homogeneous in Si, Cl, K and Th. Iron and H2O have lower abundances in the southern highlands ([1],[2]). Global maps of chemical composition of the Martian surface have never been derived from the OMEGA dataset and thus at a resolution of ~1.5km/px which is about 200 better then GRS. In order to create those chemical composition maps, the abundances maps of mafic build with OMEGA [3] will be used to predict the chemical composition according to the minerals found on the surface.  Those elementary composition maps will enable direct comparison with global maps of chemical composition derived with GRS (Gamma Ray Spectrometer) and in situ data as shown hereafter. Dataset: We use OMEGA reflectance spectra in the near-infrared ranging from 0.97 µm to 2.5 µm, corrected from atmospheric and aerosols contribution using the model developed by [4]. The entire VNIR OMEGA dataset corresponds to a total of almost 9000 data cubes acquired over 3.6 Martian years.  Afterwards, a series of processing was applied, excluding cubes presenting instrumental artifacts (spurious pixels) and/or surface (water and CO2 ice) and atmospheric (high optical opacity) unfavorable observational conditions. Eventually, 3716 data cubes were selected and used for this study. Those remaining cubes were combined in order to build a 3-D global cube of the Martian surface [5].  This map is allowing the user to extract atmospheric and aerosol-corrected NIR spectrum from any location of Mars. Each corrected spectrum presenting a significant pyroxene band depth (> 0.02) was then modelled according to Shkuratov radiative transfer theory to retrieve abundances of LCP (pigeonite), HCP (augite), olivine (forsterite), plagioclase (labradorite) and dust (palagonite). Detailed on the computation of the modal mineralogy abundance maps are given in [3]. The resulting maps were then used to derive elementary composition as presented in following section. The composition was thus only calculated for the modelled spectra, which means that it is derived only for spectra presenting a strong (> 2%) pyroxene signature. Chemical composition mapping: The corresponding elementary compositions of modelled minerals used in order to compute the first OMEGA chemical maps are presented in Table 1.

The derived abundances were thus converted in elementary composition according to the abundance, chemical composition and density of each endmember. It is important to mention que this method has some limitations. Among them, the method induces small artifacts in the obtained values regarding the possible maximum and minimum values. This is due to the fact that the limit in terms of wt% of elements is set by the conversion method. This phenomenon creates sharp boundaries on the diagram that may not be physical (Figure 1). Hence the SiO2 maximum value for example cannot reach values above 52%, and thus with this method it is not possible to derive basaltic andesite and andesite composition.  Figure 1 - Alkali-silica diagram with OMEGAextracted chemical abundances. Each point corresponds to one deconvolved OMEGA spectrum over a sample of ~9 million spectra. Orange dotted circle represents the limit where 99% of the distribution is found. Green box = GRS TES Gale Gusev Pathfinder soils Meridiani soils GRS data points, Orange box = TES data points, Blue circle = Gale crater, Purple circle = Gusev [6].   The alkali-silica diagram (Figure 1) extracted from the modal mineralogy is also in agreement with previous studies with basaltic nature of the Martian surface. The OMEGA extracted composition locally tends towards more picritic basalts then expected with GRS results but these compositions are nonetheless in agreement with Pathfinder and Meridiani soils [6].  The elementary composition derived with OMEGA is also close to the one obtained with GRS [2] with for example derived Si content ranging between 21 and 24 wt % and homogeneously spread on the surface. Nevertheless, when we look closely at the global SiO2 distribution (Figure 2) we see that the two distributions are different. The richest regions do not appear at the same locations except for a small area north of Hellas basin. It could be due to the difference in resolution by a factor 200. Larger spatial resolution tends to increase inhomogeneity. Moreover, TES and OMEGA do not sample the same depth on the surface which can also explain some of the differences observed. Nevertheless, the OMEGA-based SiO2 distribution is still relatively homogenous on the surface and always consistent with the basaltic nature of the soils. The variations of the SiO2 distribution are actually correlated with the augite abundance variations, but as the map is derived from the modelled abundance maps such correlations are expected.  Further investigations including correlations with geological units will be carried out to explain those small (of the order of a few percent) inhomogeneities and discrepancies with GRS data. The iron content is always lower than the one showed in the GRS maps with abundances between 4 and 8 wt % where the GRS abundance is > 10 wt %. It has to be noted that the computation of the elementary composition with OMEGA strongly depends on the nature of the end-member used to derive the modal mineralogy. Even though the spectra are wellreproduced with the 5 end-members used for now, it is possible that a missing end-member in the model may account for the lacking iron content. Another possible solution to compensate for the lack of iron would be to force the iron oxide abundance to be > 8 wt % during minimization routine as it was stated in [7] where this trend was already discussed.   Several element ratios will be presented. One example shown here is the Al/Si ratio, which is on average higher than the ones measured at Gusev and with GRS. Those previous studies also showed that in situ and orbital measurements do not show Al depletion as it has been first evoked from the Martian meteorites.
