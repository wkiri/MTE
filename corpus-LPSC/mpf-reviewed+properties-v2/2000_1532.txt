Introduction:  Impact processes probably produced significant volumes of melt throughout Martian history [1]. Most impact glasses exposed at the surface have obviously been decomposed, especially during warmer wetter epochs. A number of studies suggests that a large fraction of soils on Mars are erosional products of hydrothermally altered (oxidized) impact melt sheets [1, 2, 3, 4]. Nevertheless, relatively young impact glasses produced under current climate during the last billion years or so could have survived [5]. Impact glasses might be found on the Martian surface much more often than on Earth due to different exogenic conditions and slower weathering rates on Mars [5]. They might contribute to the optical properties of Mars' surface both globally and locally [5, 6]. Basilevsky et al. [7] simulated glass formation due to small-scale impacts into Martian regolith. The glasses were produced from the Martian bright soil simulant JSC Mars-1 [8]) by quick melting using various techniques. The details of the experiment, sample preparation, compositional and color variations are described in [7]. Here we present and discuss the reflectance spectra of the samples.   Experimental procedure:  Bidirectional reflectance spectra in the range of 0.3-2.5 µm were recorded at i=30°, e=0° with the RELAB bidirectional spectrometer (Brown University). Biconical reflectance spectra were acquired in a CO2- and H20- purged environment using FTIR-spectrometers Bruker IFS88 (DLR; 0.5-17 µm; i=e=20°) and Nicolet 740 (RELAB; 2.5-25 µm i=e=30°). The use of different instruments in two laboratories allows us to distinguish the compositionally significant spectral variations from the instrumental effects. Five size fractions ranging from silt to medium sand (<40, 40-80, 80-125, 125-200, and 200-380 µm) were spectrally studied. The samples (see [7] for details) included: unaltered palagonitic soil (marked as „P"), two glasses produced by quick melting the soil in the resistance furnace at relevant PO2 followed by the fast („F") and slower („S") cooling, and two samples produced by laser shots into the soil at slightly different PO2  („L2" and „L4"). Results:  The Hawaiian palagonitic soil JSC Mars1 is a reasonably good though not perfect spectral analog of Martian bright regions [8]. Its spectra (Fig. 1-2) show a relatively featureless Fe3+ absorption edge in the visible, a weak (1-5%) broad absorption centered near 1 µm, the features due to OH- and H20 at 1.42, 1.92, 3, and 6 µm, as well as a weak band  near 2.2 µm due to Al-OH in aluminous clays (Fig. 1-2). The spectral slope in the NIR region is relatively neutral varying from slightly negative (blue) to somewhat positive (red) depending on the grain size and the packing density. The spectral mismatch between Martian bright regions and the JSC Mars-1 implies higher contents of well-crystalline Fe-oxides and lower contents of water in Martian soils, as was noted in [8] as well.  Brightness of the simulant at 0.8 µm varies from 0.36 for the finest fraction to 0.17 for the coarsest one. The glasses (S, F, L2, and L4) produced from this soil show significant spectral variability depending on the method of production, but are characterized by several common features. All the glasses are darker and less red in the visible than the starting material (Fig. 1). As expected, their brightness at 0.8-µm reflectance peak and the visible spectral slope (e.g., red/blue color ratios) decrease with increasing grain size. Along with the visible absorption edge, all the glasses show two moderate (band depth is 0.15-0.30) broad NIR absorptions   near 1 and 1.9 µm corresponding to crystal-field transitions in octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated Fe2+ ions, respectively [9]. These two bands are superimposed with the much broader absorption which is probably centered in the UV and extends through the whole NIR region being responsible for the low albedo and the positive (red) continuum slope of the glasses in the NIR. In addition, the spectra of the pure glasses show the lack of the features due to H20, OH -, and Al-OH, indicating the loss of hydrated phases. In the mid-IR the glasses exhibit a Christiansen feature near 8-8.2 µm and a very broad round Reststrahlen band centered near 10 µm whose intensity is higher for the coarser fractions.  The glass F is darker than the glass S mostly due to Fe-Ti-oxides finely dispersed in the melt [7]. Furthermore, the glass F shows more intense and broader Fe2+ features suggesting higher Fe2+ contents at least at some areas of this heterogeneous melt. Further studies of the samples (e.g., Mössbauer spectroscopy) is needed to see whether this is the case. The glasses produced by pulsed laser (L2 and L4) are the brightest and have the weakest Fe-absorptions. This appears to be a particle size effect, since these glasses contain abundant tiny vesicles (see Fig. 2 in [7]) which significantly increase multiple scattering. An absorption band near 4.27 µm is found in the spectra of laser treatment products (Fig. 3). This band appears to be due to CO2 trapped in the small bubbles mentioned REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY OF MARTIAN IMPACT GLASS SIMULANTS:  L. V. Moroz  et al.  above. A similar feature was found in the spectra of the famous Martian meteorite ALH 84001 [10]. In the spectra of Mars' surface this feature would be masked by the strong atmospheric CO2 absorption. However, this finding may have other interesting implications discussed in [7].    Discussion and conclusions:  Most spectra of Martian surface are consistent with mixing of bright red hematite-bearing dust with dark gray mafic pyroxene-containing sand [11]. Bright regions on Mars are relatively spectrally homogeneous  due to high mobility of the fine bright dust particles during dust storms, but show some spatial spectral variations [12]. Although impact glass fragments may contribute to these mobile fines, their spectral signatures do not seem to dominate the spectral properties of the soils. Nevertheless, some influence can not be ruled out. E.g., the impact melt fragments may mask the weak metal-OH feature near 2.2 µm observed in many spectra of bright areas [13, 12] and may contribute to the decrease in depth of the bound water feature at 3 µm which also shows spatial variations [12, 14, 15]. Dark regions on Mars show a more considerable spectral variability than the bright areas [16]. Many spectra of dark areas show two broad Fe2+ absorptions near 0.90.95 and 2.1-2.2 µm being consistent with low-Ca and high-Ca pyroxenes present in various proportions [17]. Although broad Fe2+ absorptions are present in the spectra of Fe-bearing glasses as well, their wavelength positions are different (Fig. 1). In addition, the spectra of the dark areas on Mars are characterized by a distinctive negative NIR continuum, while the spectra of the glasses are red-sloped in this spectral region.  Thus, at first glance it seems that the impact glasses would not show significant contribution to the spectral properties of the Martian surface. However, this does not mean that their content is insignificant. The Fe2+ absorptions in the glass are much weaker than those in the mafic minerals and thus can be masked. The oxide coatings on the surface of glass [18] or the influence of atmospheric aerosols [19] may change the positive NIR continuum slope of the glass to the negative slope. In addition, the spectral variability of Mars surface is known to increase with increasing spatial resolution of observations. Therefore, even though the impact glasses are not easily detectable on the Martian surface at global scale by telescopic observations, they might be detected in the future by spacecraft at some locations, for example, within the low-albedo splotches seen on the floors of many impact craters [20]. In addition, our spectral data is consistent with the idea that the rocks at the Mars Pathfinder landing site may be the pieces of the impact melt [6]. References: [1] Clifford S. M.
