Introduction: This abstract reports on the far-field rock size frequency distribution at the Mars Pathfinder landing site and compares it with the near field distribution. Previous work has reported on counts of all rocks within a 3-6 m annulus around the Pathfinder lander [1] and a crude estimate of the distribution of large rocks outside of this annulus [2]. This abstract combines detailed measurements of rocks in the far field with those measured in the 3-6 m annulus and discusses these distributions in terms of those at the Viking landing and rocky sites on Earth. The reason for measuring rocks in the far field is to provide a more statistically representative number of large rocks than might be present in the relatively small area of the near field. Ongoing work will include a more complete count of all rocks in the near field out to a distance of 10 m. This data set, when combined with the far field data set described herein will represent the final rock data set that we will submit for archival to the Planetary Data System. Understanding the size-frequency distribution of rocks on Mars is important for two reasons. (1) Rocks on the surface of a planet and a landing site in particular result from the geological processes that have formed that surface, so that characterizing the sizefrequency distribution of rocks may lead to a better understanding of the geomorphologic and geologic history of the site [e.g., 3]. (2) Rocks on the surface of a planet represent an obvious and real hazard to landing spacecraft. The better the rock size-frequency distribution of Mars can be understood, the better the potential hazards to landers can be described and quantified [e.g., 4]. Prior to the Mars Pathfinder landing, Golombek and Rapp [4] found that the size-frequency distribution of rocks at the Viking landing sites and a number of rocky locations on Earth all could be fit with simple exponential curves, which are compatible with fracture and fragmentation theory [see discussion and references in 4]. Fits of data at the Viking landing sites suggested a general exponential function could be used to describe the size-frequency distribution of rocks at any location where the total rock abundance was estimated from remote infrared thermal measurements [5]. This general function was used to correctly predict the sizefrequency distribution of large, potentially hazardous boulders at the Mars Pathfinder landing site [4, 6]. Near- and Far-Field Data Sets: The near-field rock count was produced using the MarsMap virtual reality software [7] during Pathfinder operations. The analysis was carried out on the Monster pan set of Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) images [1]. For each rock, various parameters were measured: the position of the left tangent point where the rock touches the soil, the rock apparent width, and the rock maximum height (2035 rocks were measured). A 3 m to 6 m annulus was thoroughly surveyed for rock sizes above 3 cm and was used to assemble rock statistics (1472 rocks). Far-field rocks were measured using the stereo baseline afforded by the IMP camera mast. The difference in pixel distance of far-field rocks to the horizon between pre- and post-mast deploy images determines the rock range. The range then determines the true apparent width of the rock, which can be related to the diameter (average of the length and width) [e.g., 4]. Some 961 far-field rocks were tagged, and 465 of these could be observed in the pre-deploy images. A minimum rock width of 5 pixels was used. This selection factor determines the maximum range at which rocks of a given size can be identified. Calculations of cumulative fractional area and cumulative number use the rangeappropriate area, and also account for near-field obscurations. Cumulative Number Versus Diameter Results: The distribution of rocks at the Mars Pathfinder site is generally similar to the Viking 2 landing site and similar in shape to the Viking 1 landing site, with more rocks at all diameters (Figure 1). When plotted as the cumulative number of rocks per meter squared versus diameter on a log-log plot, the shape of the distribution is generally convex up and similar to many rocky sites on Earth [4]. At diameters between 0.2 and 0.8 m, the distribution can be approximated reasonably well by a straight line, which is similar to power law behavior [8, 9], with 0.03 to 1.0 cumulative number of rocks/m 2. Below 0.2 m diameter, the cumulative number of rocks/m 2 at the Mars Pathfinder landing site exceeds that at the Viking 2 landing site by a factor of 2 to 4, with a total of just under 20 rocks/m 2 (Figure 1). In all three cases, the distribution of rocks above 0.8 m diameter and below 0.2 m diameter is not approximated by a power law distribution. At small diameters, the distribution flattens out and reaches a maximum (the total number of rocks/m 2); at large diameters the distribution drops off more rapidly than the power law defined for the distribution in the 0.2-0.8 m diameter range. In the far field measurements, the cumulative number of rocks at large diameters is even lower than shown in the near field (Figure 1). Yogi, the largest rock in the near field data set (1.5 m diameter) yields a minimum of 0.01 rocks/m 2. The far field data, which encompasses a much larger area (and so is less subject to the problem of having one large rock, such as Yogi, in a small counting area) shows that the cumulative number of MARS PATHFINDER ROCKS:  M. P. Golombek et al. rocks/m 2 greater than 2 m diameter is actually 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller or roughly 0.00004/m 2. Although the shape of the curve defined by the far field rocks is different than the near field, the number of rocks at large diameter is clearly much lower than described by a power-law fit to the 0.2-0.8 m diameter rocks and is generally consistent with an exponential fit to the near field data (Figure 1). A reasonable explanation for the lower slope in the far field data may be a resolution effect (similar to counting craters near the limit of resolution of an image), where fewer rocks of a given size are counted than are actually there. This would produce fewer rocks at progressively smaller sizes than are actually there (a similar effect can be seen in the far field measurements of the Viking 1 landing site [4]). An alternative to this is that there may be multiple segments to the rock distribution curves [e.g., 10]. In either case, the number of rocks at large diameters is far lower than predicted by power law fits to 0.20.8 m diameter rocks in the near field, but fall in the range described by a simple exponential fit to the near field data. Cumulative Area Versus Diameter Results: The cumulative area covered by rocks within the 3-6 m annulus is 16%, with variations ranging from 11% coverage in the eastern half of the annulus, to 25% coverage within the southwest quadrant. The distribution of cumulative area covered by rocks versus diameter is similar to the Viking 2 landing site and similar in shape to the Viking 1 landing site (without the outcrops), with greater area covered at all diameters (Figure 2). A log-log plot of the data shows a clear convex up shape that is not linear (as required by a power-law distribution), but can be fit very well by a simple exponential function. This curve is very similar to the model rock distributions proposed for Mars by Golombek and Rapp [4]. The maximum reached at small diameters is the total rock coverage (16%). The area covered by 1-2 m diameter boulders is 1-2% and is dominated by Yogi (a large rock in a small counting area), which covers 1.7% of the area and produces a flattening of the curve at this size. In the far field measurements, the area covered by rocks larger that 1 m is substantially lower (0.04%) and decreases below 0.01% at diameters above 3 m. These values are 5-10 times smaller those derived from a crude count of large rocks in the far field [2]. Although the shape of the far field curve deviates from the near field distribution (probably the resolution effect described earlier), the area covered by rocks greater than 2 m in diameter fits very well with that predicted at these large diameters by the exponential fit to the near field data [see also 2]. Even if the area of the far-field estimate is off by an order of magnitude or the difference in the shape of the distribution at the large diameters is real, the area covered by large rocks is orders of magnitude smaller than suggested by power law fits to the smaller diameter near-field rocks. This result further supports the use of exponential functions for estimating rock size-frequency distributions for engineering studies of potentially hazardous blocks on the surface of Mars.
