Introduction:  Photometric observations by the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) have been used to characterize the rocks and soils at the Ares Valles landing site [1,2]. Such observations, taken at several visible and near-infrared wavelengths, can constrain the composition and morphology of the target materials. However, under Martian conditions, the observations are also significantly influenced by the ambient illumination [3]. Preliminary conclusions regarding the scattering properties of rocks and soil have been drawn from interpretation of IMP images in the absence of a sky model [2]. This work will demonstrate necessary revisions to those conclusions by including an explicit treatment of the illumination geometry.   Sky and Scene Model:  A campaign of sky observations with the Sun low in the sky (so that the widest variety of scattering geometries was available) was carried out throughout the IMP mission. This data set has been used to characterize the properties of atmospheric dust and to derive a model of the diffuse illumination [4]. Similar conclusions were drawn based on vertical scans of the sky near noon [5]. We use a refinement of the Tomasko et al. radiative transfer model by Wegryn et al. (in preparation) that has a revised treatment of the surface and has been extended to multiple wavelengths using the spectral spot of the sky [also discussed in [3]). We adapt the Tomasko et al. model [4] to predict the illumination for any time during the IMP mission by holding most of the dust properties constant, changing only the dust opacity and the solar elevation. We use the measured dust opacity as a function of time [6]. The radiative transfer model predicts the radiance field that is illuminating objects in the scene. We have created a simulation tool that integrates over the diffuse illumination field and adds direct sunlight to model the radiance for a simulated scene (specified by surface normals). The tool can simulate Lambert surfaces, Hapke [7] scattering surfaces, and the measured bi-directional reflectance of the IMP radiometric calibration targets. For the geologic scene, indirect shadowing is neglected (that is, an object sees only the hemisphere toward which it is facing, but shadows caused by nearby rocks, for example, are ignored). For the calibration targets, the shadow caused by the stamen is explicitly modeled (Fig. 1).  Figure 1. IMP radiometric calibration targets. The lower target is shown above, as seen by the left and right eyes.  A simulated view is shown below.  Calibration Targets:  A study of the calibration targets is important for several reasons. First, they are important for validating the model. We have simulated calibration target images at a variety of times of day and wavelengths. The model is able to reproduce the images geometrically and photometrically under most conditions. The major exception is that the model fails when the shadow is pointing toward the camera for longer wavelength filters. We have found that the laboratory measurements show a significant, broad specular-reflection peak at longer wavelengths. This effect is not seen in the target images on Mars. Treating the target as a Lambert reflector produces better results than using the laboratory measurements in this case. Second, the images are important because they are frequently used for image calibration [2, 7]. The target is used to measure the radiance scene by a level surface. The target is typically treated as a level, Lambert surface [2]. We have simulated the target for different times of day, taking into account both the target's known tilt and the measured bi-directional reflectance function. We focus on red and blue wavelengths (wavelengths shorter than 900 nm are not affected by the specular reflection error discussed above). We find that the ratio of the brightest part of the target to a true Lambert surface with unit reflectivity varies with both filter and illumination angle. The variations are of order 10%, with times near noon closest to ideal. The color change of the target with time of day is only of order 2% (with the target slightly redder than a Illumination and Photometry at the Pathfinder Landing Site. M. T. Lemmon, et al.  true, white Lambert surface several hours before and after noon). Scene photometry:  Taking a brightness ratio of objects in the scene to the calibration target brightness gives an estimate of R*, which is the ratio of the scene brightness to the brightness a unit reflectance Lambert surface would have [2, 7]. This takes out much of the known reddening caused by the diffuse, skylight. There are two important deficiencies of this simplification. First, object faces that are not parallel to the target see a different illumination, and are colored differently [3]. We model this by placing a sphere with a Lambert surface of unit reflectance in the simulation (Fig. 2). In this example, the top and sun-facing side of the sphere are relatively blue-looking, while the bottom, side, and shaded parts of the sphere are reddened (with the red/blue ratio increased to ~2 near the shadow). We will use range maps giving surface normals for rocks in order to correct for this effect.   Figure 2. Simulated sphere, at early-morning illumination, normalized to a perfect Lambert surface (gray background).  This effect is not important for measurements of most soils and some rocks faces, as they are roughly parallel to the calibration target (that is, roughly level). The second important effect we are investigating is the effect of the diffuse light on the phase function of soils and rocks. The back- and specular- scattering lobes can be used to constrain the surface properties of the material [2]. We will present results showing the effect of the broad sky illumination and revising estimates of surface photometric properties. References: [1] Smith P.H., et al., (1997) Science 278, 1758.
