Justin.Filiberto@sunysb.edu  Introduction:  The SNC meteorites and the Pathfinder and MER Rover data represent our only information on individual rocks on the Martian surface, and therefore our only glimpse into Martian igneous processes.  Because of this limitation, terrestrial analogues would provide a wealth of additional information.  Analogies to terrestrial rocks have been made for the meteorites and Pathfinder rock but the differences have suggested that numerous chemical disparities exist between terrestrial and Martian magmas.  However, these comparisons have been primarily based on terrestrial basalts and terrestrial peridotite nodules.  The potential for better analogues was shown by Lentz et al. who compared the nakhlite meteorites with Theo's flow, a pyroxenite flow in Ontario, Canada [1].  We have looked for alternative terrestrial analogues, in order to better understand martian magmatic processes. Terrestrial ferropicrites.  Terrestrial ferropicrites are volcanic rocks, commonly associated with tholeiitic flood volcanics, alkalic extrusives, and more evolved rhyolites and dacites [2-4].  They consist of a sequence of igneous rocks: a basal olivine cumulate layer, a mid-layer clinopyroxenite, and an olivine or clinopyroxene spinefex-textured top [2, 5].  The mineralogic sequence is comparable to the chassignites,  nahklites, and olivine-phyric shergottites, respectively.  Although detailed petrologic studies have been done on the ferropicrites, their formation history is still debated.  Some workers suggest that the ferropicrites represent primitive liquid formed in pockets of Fe-rich streaks in the terrestrial mantle [7].  Others have suggested that the ferropicrites are partial cumulates containing evolved liquids [2].    Questions regarding the origin as "liquids" or partial cumulates are analogous to the questions raised about the origin of the olivinephyric shergotties.    Table 1. Major element chemistry of ferropicrites from Pechenga, Russia [2, 6] The earliest formed mineral assemblage of the ferropicrites is dominanted by olivine and chromite phenocrysts with later clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene [2].  The olivine hosts magmatic melt inclusions  containing augite, kaersutite, plagioclase, ilmenite, and magnetite [2].  Notably this is the same mineral assemblage as many of the SNC meteorites [e.g. 8, 9].  Geochemistry: The geochemical signatures of ferropicrites from [2-5] have been compared with those of martian rocks.  Table 1 shows the bulk rock chemistry of 2 typical ferropicrites [2, 6]. The ferropicrites share the low-Al, high-Fe compositional characteristics of many of the SNC meteorites. Mg/Si vs. Al/Si ratios: The terrestrial ferropicrites lie off of the terrestrial fractionation line and clearly in the "Martian" field (Fig. 1).  They span the same range in this compositional space as the Martian rocks, from the most cumulate portions with strong similarities to the cumulate SNC meteorites to the most liquid end (e.g. Yamato 980459, QUE 94201, Gusev basalts) members.  The former similarity can be attributed to the dominant effect of the mineralogy.  The latter similarity is due to the low Al, high Fe compositions of the "liquid" portion of the ferropicrites.   Figure 1.  Mg/Si vs. Al/Si variation in SNC meteorites [10, 11], Gusev basalts [12] and Pathfinder dust free rock [13] compared with terrestrial ferropicrites from [2, 5] Fe/Si ratio: The Martian rocks all have relatively high iron contents compared with typical terrestrial basalts. The ferropicrites have higher Fe content than most other terrestrial igneous rocks, with some units having Fe contents indistinguishable from those of the Martian rocks (Fig. 2) contents.  The ferropicrites and the SNC meteorites range over similar Fe/Si compositional space.

Fe vs. Si variation (atomic wt%) in Martian rocks [9-12] compared to ferropicrites [2, 5]. Volatile elements: Mars has been proposed as a volatile-rich planet based on the SNC meteorites, oribital data, and whole rock data [14].  However, comparing the SNC meteorites with ferropicrites the volatile element ratios (ie. Na/Al, K/La) are not consistently different.  For example, the K/La of the SNC meteorites has been proposed to be ~560-670 [15-17] which is indistinguishable from that of some of the ferropicrites (Fig. 3).    Figure 3. K vs. La variation (ppm) in SNC meteorites [10, 11] compared to ferropicrites [2, 5]. Heat Producing Elements: Martian rocks have been characterized by high K/U, Th/U, and K/Th ratios relative to MORB basalts [16, 18].  This has led some workers to suggest that the Martian mantle differs in these elements from the terrestrial mantle.  However, some ferropicrites have "enriched" ratios similar to those of the SNC meteorites (Fig. 4).   Figure 4.  K vs. Th variation (ppm) in SNC meteorites [10, 11] compared to ferropicrites [2, 5]. Conclusion: The ferropicrites may represent close terrestrial analogues to the SNC meteorites.  Their crystallization history, associated lithologies, and tectonic environment may provide invaluable information about Martian magmatic history. References:  [1]  Lentz R.C.F. et al. 1999.
