Introduction:  In the search for evidence of an ancient Martian biosphere, the possible presence of relict hydrothermal spring systems is of great interest.  A Mössbauer spectrometer is part of NASA's 2001 and 2003 missions to Mars, and we report in this context on Mössbauer investigations, aided by XRD and field emission SEM/EDX, of samples from an iron-rich hydrothermal vent mound in Yellowstone National Park.  Primary precipitates (those near the vent and on the surface) were identified by Mössbauer spectroscopy as ferrihydrite, an amorphous ferric mineraloid. Subsurface samples include the smectite clay nontronite, hematite, small-particle/nanophase goethite, and siderite.  Our research demonstrates that in-situ Mössbauer spectroscopy can help determine whether hydrothermal mineral deposits exist on Mars and assist in identifying samples for later transport to Earth. Measurements:  Samples investigated were taken as cores at four locations along the main outflow channel of a large vent mound at Chocolate Pots (YNP), with each divided into four depths increments, except at the vent.  They are listed below, along with physical data of the water in the outflow channel immediately above each collection site.

An electron micrograph (FESEM) of sample 3C1 (A, next column) shows webs and strings of dried mucilage with attached mineral grains and aggregates.  In the vicinity of the vent, the deposit resembles a laminated glass that fractures readily on handling.  A FESEM image of sample 5C1 (B) shows cross-sectional views of several encrusted bacterial filaments preserved as molds - note the partial to complete infilling. For initial characterization, room temperature (300 K) Mössbauer spectra were obtained for all 13 samples; the 2C series is exhibited below.  Spectral variability is greatest for those samples collected farthest from the vent, suggesting greater biological diversity. A strong ferrous contribution is seen for 2C3, which lies between primarily ferric deposits, above and below.  Samples were also measured at temperatures down to ~14 K.  The results are illustrated with a partial temperature sequence for sample 2C3.  In addition to the widely spaced central doublet, two magnetically split sextets are evident at 200 K, which spread apart as temperature is lowered, and a magnetic transition A  1.00 µµm  5.00 µµm BVelocity (mm/s) -10 -5 0 5 10 2C1 2C2 2C3 2C4 MÖSSBAUER STUDY OF AN IRON-RICH VENT MOUND:  D. G. Agresti et al. occurs between 40 K and 50 K at the expense of the central doublet. Primary Precipitates:  All surface deposits and samples collected near the vent exhibit a closely spaced doublet at 300 K similar to that of 2C1.  A magnetic sextet appears below about 45 K, with broadened peaks to the lowest temperatures [1], suggesting an amorphous nature.  This behavior is consistent with that of the poorly crystalline mineraloid ferrihydrite (~5Fe2O3·9H2O).  X-ray powder diffraction measurements [1] exhibit broad maxima corresponding to interplanar ("d") spacings of ~0.25 nm and ~0.15 nm, confirming this assignment. Subsurface Samples:  Mössbauer parameters [1] of the six remaining "subsurface" samples (2C2-4, 3C2-4) are consistent with assignment of their mineral components to the smectite clay mineral nontronite [(Ca,Na)0.66Fe4Si7.34Al0.66O20(OH)4·nH2O], the ferrous mineral siderite (FeCO3), nanophase goethite (αFeOOH),  and   hematite   (α-Fe2O3).

The broadened XRD peaks for goethite and nontronite allow estimates of mean particle sizes, from the Scherrer formula, of ~14 nm and ~5 nm, respectively, confirming the nanophase nature of Chocolate Pots deposit.  Nanophase material can be a fossilizing medium for past microbial life.

Useful data [4] could likewise be derived for nanophase goethite, if observed in the Martian soil.
