Introduction and abstract: The spectrum of Mars at 2.4-45 µm has been obtained on July, 31, 1997 (Ls = 157¡) by the Short Wavelength Spectrometer of the Infrared Space Observatory. In the solar reflected part of the spectrum (λ  ≤ 4.2 µm) the surface reflectance clearly shows the hydration band with maximum absorption at 2.9 µm, from which a 2.0-2.7 wt% water content in the Martian uppermost layer is estimated. A decrease of reflectance from 3.8 µm to 5 µm is also seen. This behaviour is consistent with basalts and palagonite, but not with hematite. In the thermal range, mineralogical signatures at 5-12 µm are globally consistent with a basaltic composition, and suggest labradorite and diopside as major components. Specific minima are detected at 5.7, 7.2 and 11.1Êµm. Reexamination of earlier data sets indicates that the latter two have been observed before, although generally not discussed. The presence of additional features at 26.5, 31 and 43.5 µm is also indirectly suggested. Carbonate minerals are tentatively detected from this ensemble of features, though no single carbonate species can be unambiguously identified. Observations: The Short Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) of ISO acquired spectra of Mars in July, 1997 in the range 2.3-45 µm (see [1]). This period corresponds to the end of summer in the northern hemisphere (Ls = 157¡), and is synchronous with Mars Pathfinder observations. The phase of Mars ranged from 38¡ to 40.5¡. The data consist of three complete spectra in grating mode (resolving power R~15002500, or 2 cm-1) and portions of the 20-45 µm spectrum observed in Fabry-Perot mode (R~31000, or 0.1 cm-1), with signal to noise ratio of a few hundred. All measurements are disk-integrated. This report focuses on the SWS spectrum acquired on revolution 624 (July 31). Other observations were performed by the Long Wavelength Spectrometer in the 45-200Êµm range. Reduction and modeling: Calibration was performed using the standard SWS scheme, plus a special processing to account for spectral fringing and nonlinearity at high flux. This problem is specially important at longer wavelength due to the very large brightness of Mars, and is not completely solved yet. The Martian spectrum was then divided by a model accounting for reflected solar light and thermal emission of the planet, and for atmospheric absorption by CO2, H2O, CO, and HDO [2]. In this procedure, the thermal component is not a simple black body, but the integral of contributions from unit surface areas with temperatures ranging from 150 to 280 K (retrieved from the European Martian Climate Database). This model correctly reproduces the overall shape of the spectrum, and most atmospheric absorptions. Between 17.5Êµm and 45Êµm were non-linearity occurs, the surface/dust spectrum is retrieved from the depth of the water vapor bands [2]. The resulting spectral sampling is ~1Êµm, and the relative uncertainty increases from 2 to 5% with decreasing wavelength. NIR range: The spectral range below 4.2 µm is dominated by solar reflected light, the main contribution is therefore provided by bright regions near the sub-solar point (Tharsis and Lunae Planum). The main features in the low-resolution spectrum of Fig. 1 are the deep band of hydrated minerals at 2.7-3.7Êµm, and an inflexion at 4.2Êµm. The global shape is in very good agreement with composite reflectance spectra derived from ISM and IRS observations by [3]. Using the relationship given by [4], we infer an average water content of 2.0-2.7 wt% in the Martian uppermost layer, versus 1.9% and 2.3% computed from IRS reflectance spectra for dark and bright regions respectively. The band profile is best matched by spectra of basalts or palagonite. The inflexion at 4.1 µm is similar to that observed in smectite or montmorillonite, but is not reproduced by crystalline iron oxides (notice that the sharp 2.75Êµm band always present in phyllosilicates cannot be measured on Mars, because it is superimposed on a saturated CO2 band). Aerosols backscattering is evident on the spectrum, and opacity has been estimated to τ~0.2 by [2]. This value is consistent with the value measured by Mars Pathfinder in the visible (0.5-0.7). Scattering contributes to the spectral slope shortward of 2.65Êµm. 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 Wavelength (µm) 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 Est im ate r efle ct an ce ISO Margaritifer Ophir Pl.

Martian surface mineralogy from ISO: S. Erard et al. Thermal IR range: Above 4 µm, the main contribution to the spectrum is the thermal emission of the surface, which is dominated by dark regions and is considerably weighted towards the sub-solar point. The main contributions are therefore expected to originate from Lunae Planum, Solis Planum, Ophir Planum and Valles Marineris. In this domain surface materials are observed in emission, so that strong absorptions show up as troughs in the spectra; however, band profiles depend very much on oscillator strength, and are deeply affected by particle size. The colder aerosols are seen in transmission, and have typically much narrower bands. The strongest feature is a broad absorption at 8-12Êµm, which corresponds to a fundamental mode of silicates. Minima are present at 5.6, 6.3 (marginally), 7.0-7.4, 8.3-9.0, 9.7 and 12.3 µm. Other, remarkably narrow features are present at 6.65, 9.37 (marginal), 10.1 and 11.1 µm (see [1]). 6 8 10 12 Wavelength (µm) 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 Su rf ace a nd a ero so ls ISO surface model calcite hydromagnesite Fig. 2: example of modeling in the thermal range. The surface model is 50% dark basalt, 30% labradorite and 20% fayalite in emission. Transmission spectra of carbonates are given for comparison. Surface. Two maxima at 7.85 and 8.2Êµm are interpreted as the Christiansen peaks of surface minerals. The first peak is best matched by plagioclases, particularly labradorite, which also fits most of the structures observed. Clinopyroxenes, in particular diopside, fit the second Christiansen peak and the region from 11 to 12Êµm. Forsterite-poor olivines, which have a Christiansen frequency at 9.3Êµm, also match this domain correctly. Crystalline oxides do not fit at all. The best fit to the 5-7Êµm domain is provided by montmorillonite in very fine grains; the weight of bright areas in the spectrum is indeed expected to increase towards the shorter wavelengths. Among rocks, the best fits are provided by dark vesicular basalts with low Al content (7%), similar to the composition observed in SNC and at the Viking landing sites. This is consistent with analysis of pristine dark regions in the NIR range from ISM [5], with re-analysis of IRIS data [6] and with recent observations by TES [7]. The second reststrahlen band of silicates in the 16-25Êµm region is not observed. Although olivine and feldspar bands could be undetectable with our uncertainty at longer wavelength, pyroxenes should produce a prominent absorption in this range. This feature is not detected either in IRIS or TES spectra. Possible aerosols features. Narrow bands at 7.2 and 11.1Êµm were ascribed by [1] to carbonates in the aerosols seen in transmission. The general band location, relative band depths and width correspond closely to fundamentals of carbonates, the best match being magnesite. However, the two bands observed are slightly more distant than carbonatesÕ, making the identification tentative. The longer wavelength range also supports the carbonates strongly however, with three deep absorptions at 26.5, 31 and 43.5Êµm. These bands are best matched by spectra of calcite and siderite, with relative intensities consistent with the 612Êµm domain. 20 25 30 35 40 45 Wavelength (µm) 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 ISO calcite siderite Fig. 3: the long-wavelength range compared with common carbonates in transmission. Error-bars represent the uncertainty on the current data reduction. Comparison with other data sets: Features similar to those attributed to carbonates are actually present in previous data sets, although little attention has been paid to them [8]. The 7-7.3Êµm band is present in IRIS spectra [6], some newly calibrated IRS spectra [9], KAO spectra [10] and TES observations [11]. Subtle absorptions in the 11.0-11.5Êµm domain are also present in IRIS and IRS spectra, and in telescopic spectra [12]. References:  [1] Morris, P. et al. (2000) Nature submitted.
