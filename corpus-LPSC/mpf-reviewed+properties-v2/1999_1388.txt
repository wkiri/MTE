CORRELATIONS BETWEEN MULTISPECTRAL AND COMPOSITIONAL PROPERTIES OF SOILS AND ROCKS AT THE MARS PATHFINDER LANDING SITE.  J.F. Bell III 1 and D. Bustani 1,   1 Cornell University, Department of Astronomy (jfb8@cornell.edu). Summary: We are performing an exhaustive search for correlations between soil and rock elemental chemistry measurements from Pathfinder APXS and IMP observations, in an attempt to extend the APXS measurements to regions that were not directly measured. We find red/blue color ratio positively correlated with Mg, S (as noted previously [1,2]), and Cl, and negatively correlated with Si and Al. Weaker positive correlations with Fe and Ti are noted. Some of the elements correlate weakly (within current IMP and APXS uncertainties) with red/near-IR spectral ratio; none correlate with curvature or 530 or 965 nm band depth. Introduction: Mars Pathfinder utilized several complementary sets of observations in order to constrain the chemistry, mineralogy, and soil and rock formation processes at the Sagan Memorial Station [3]. Two of the potentially most complementary sets of observations are the multispectral images obtained by the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) experiment [4] and the elemental chemistry measurements obtained from the Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) experiment on the Sojourner rover [5]. Attempts to correlate these observations could provide unique new information on the origin and nature of rocks and soils. Indeed, McSween et al. [2] have described detailed work on the observed correlation between red/blue IMP spectral ratio and the APXS-derived sulfur abundances, and have related this correlation to a model of soil coverings/coatings on the rocks at the landing site. Knowledge of this IMP-APXS correlation has helped those authors to deduce the nature and possible magmatic origin of a putative "sulfur-free rock" at the Pathfinder site. Here, we are attempting to expand upon this initial work by exploring all possible correlations between IMP multispectral imaging parameters [4,6,7] and APXS chemical abundances [5]. Our goal is to be able to use observed correlations between IMP and APXS observations, as well as models to explain the observed correlations, to extend the chemical analyses to regions of the landing site not directly measured by the APXS instrument. This method would have many similarities to the technique of relating spectroscopic parameters to measured elemental compositions used successfully in lunar remote sensing [e.g., 8]. Methods: We examined two of the IMP multispectral datasets: the SuperPan and Multi-Spectral Spots (MSS) [4]. The MSS data are 64Ã—64 pixel uncompressed images through 13 narrowband "geology" filters (12 unique wavelengths and one overlap wavelength between the two eyes of IMP). We spatially coregistered MSS images in each eye and converted them into two small image cubes per spot. The SuperPan images cover nearly 85% of the landing site in all 12 wavelengths and at worst-case compression of 2:1 [4] SuperPan calibration and registration was performed by the U.S.G.S. Flagstaff [9]. Both sets of data were calibrated to radiance factor using version 1 of the IMP calibration pipeline [10], which does not account for varying percentages of diffuse vs. direct illumination. The locations of the APXS spots within the IMP imaging data were obtained from observing the imprint left in the soil by the APXS deployment process, or by pointing reconstructions performed previously by N. Bridges and others [1,2]. IMP spectra were extracted from averages within regions inside each APXS measurement area, and error bars on the extracted IMP spectra represent the variance of all the spectra folded into the average, not the actual calibration uncertainty. IMP spectral parameters [2,6,7] were then calculated for spectra from each APXS spot. Correlations between these parameters and the chemical abundances from the 12 reported APXS measurements [5] were then calculated using a linear least-squares algorithm and calculation of the r 2 value defined in [11]. We recognize that this metric for determining correlation among the IMP parameters and the APXS data is crude, and efforts are underway to employ more rigorous statistical correlation tests. However, our results can be discussed qualitatively at this point, in order to assess where to focus our efforts on additional statistical testing. Results: The strongest positive correlations that we observed were between red/blue ratio (670/440 nm, or 750/440 nm ratios) and  Mg, S, and Cl. The strongest negative correlations were between red/blue and Si and Al. Weaker but positive correlations between red/blue and Fe and Ti were also observed. We found very weak positive correlation between red/nearIR spectral ratios (670/965 nm) and Si and K, and very weak negative correlation between red/near-IR and Mg, S, Cl, Ti, and Fe. The statistical significance of these very weak correlations remains to be accurately demonstrated. We did not find any other even apparentlyweak correlations between the APXS chemical abundances and other IMP spectral parameters. References: [1] Bridges, N. et al. (1997) Eos, 78, F402.
