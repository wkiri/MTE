Reflectivity spectra of Martian bright regions are similar to those for certain palagonitic tephras [e.g., 1]. Because palagonite is the hydrated and oxidized alteration product of basaltic glass, the correspondence in reflectivity spectra implies that glass formation, which can proceed by both volcanic and impact processes, is an important Martian surface process. Formation of impact glass from melting of Martian soil likely will occur. On the basis of Viking and Pathfinder analyses, the major-element composition of Martian soil can be represented by a locally perturbed global average composition [1], so that a synthetic glass made from the composition of Mars global average soil (MGAS) will approximate the composition of impact melt made from soil anywhere on the planet. Crystallization products of that melt are potentially important mineralogical components in Martian surface material.  We report here the results of crystallization experiments conducted in a CO2 gas atmosphere which is appropriate for the current Martian atmosphere using the volatile-free (i.e., SO3-free) composition of MGAS published by [1]. A volatile-free composition is appropriate for silicate liquids derived by melting of Martian soil because of the low solubility of sulfur in silicate liquids [e.g., 2].  The crystallization products were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), reflectance spectroscopy  (350-2100 nm), magnetic methods. Synthesis and Methods. Crystallization experiments were done in one atmosphere, gas-mixing furnaces by equilibrating samples of MGAS1 (a glass with the composition of volatile-free mars global average soil [3]) at 1300°C for 16 hr in a gas atmosphere of pure CO2.  In separate experiments, the silicate liquids were then cooled by quenching to room temperature and by cooling at rates of 1000, 100, and 10°C/hr to 1000°C and then quenching to room temperature. XRD, magnetic, and VIS-NIR measurements were done on fine powders (<150 µm) using procedures described by [1]. Results and Discussion. XRD spectra of the four samples are shown in Figure 1.  The quenched sample (MGAS1-CO2A) is glass with a trace of magnetite. The XRD patterns for the other three samples are nearly the same.  The broad hump near 20-25 °2θ indicates the presence of residual glass.  The most intense peaks are at positions corresponding to Fe-spinel, and shown by the magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) XRD spectra in Figure 1.  The positions of the spinel lines in our samples are intermediate to those for magnetite and maghemite, indicating that the spinel in our samples is very cation-deficient magnetite.  Diffraction lines corresponding to pyroxene and minor feldspar are also present. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Degrees 2-Theta (Cu Ka Radiation) Magnetite MTISH1 MGAS1-CO2A (Quenched) MGAS1-CO2B (Cooled 1000C/hr) MGAS1-CO2C (Cooled 100C/hr) MGAS1-CO2D (Cooled 10C/hr) Powder X-Ray Diffraction Spectra Feldspar Pyroxene Maghemite MHS3 [Morris et al., 2000] Fig.1 Except for the quenched sample (MGAS1-CO2A), the visible and near-IR spectra (Figure 2) are relatively flat, featureless, and have albedos <0.2.  This behavior  CRYSTALLIZATION FROM IMPACT MELTS OF MARTIAN SOIL:  R. V. Morris et al. can be attributed to the magnetite, a black mineral with a nearly flat spectral slope at these wavelengths.  The only significant indication of an iron crystal-field transition is the weak absorption feature centered near 430 nm which can be attributed to Fe3+, perhaps associated with the pyroxene detected in the XRD spectra. Except for the quenched sample, which is predominantly glass, the samples are strongly magnetic (~4, 21, 68, and 83 x10-6 m3/kg for MGAS1-CO2A, CO2B, - CO2C, and CO2D, respectively) because of the presence of magnetite.  Using (400±100) x10-6 m3/kg as the susceptibility for pure magnetite [e.g., 1], these measurements correspond to 1.0±0.3, 5.0±1.3, 17±4 and 21±5 equivalent wt. % magnetite. Application to Mars.  Our experiments show that the crystallization of melts formed from impact into Martian soil in a CO2 atmosphere might contribute magnetite, pyroxene, and minor feldspar to the Martian surface.  The strongly magnetic nature of Martian soil [e.g., 4] might be a manifestation of this process. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 Wavelength  (x1000 nm) Ref le ct iv ity MGAS1-CO2A (Quench) (0.3) (0.5) (0.7) MGAS1-CO2B (Cooled 1000C/hr) MGAS1-CO2C (Cooled 100C/hr) MGAS1-CO2D (Cooled 10C/hr) (0.0) Offs et Fig. 2 References: [1] Morris et al., JGR, 105, 1757, 2000; [2] Danckwerth et al., PLPSC10, 517, 1979; [3] Morris et al.
