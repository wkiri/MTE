A variety of surficial processes have been proposed to explain the presently observed surface material on Mars.  Such models include palagonitization, hydrothermal models, acid-fog models and others [e.g. 2,3,4,5].  The validity of some of these models can be tested by low temperature flow through experiments investigating the interaction of various fluids with synthetic Martian analog material. Although the details of Martian water/rock interactions are unconstrained, these flow-through experiments can systematically explore a broad spectrum of Martian water/rock interaction characteristics. This is achieved by exploring several important factors such as fluid and rock composition, temperature and flow rate. In-situ monitoring of the chemistry and mineralogy of the system permits comprehensive modeling under various conditions. The results obtained from these experiments provide useful comparisons to presently observed Martian compositional and spectral data and serve to test results obtained by other workers.  Some spectral analyses such as Mossbauer and FT-IR may serve as predictions for data obtained by future missions (e.g. Mars 2003). Analog Materials: Most experimental studies aimed at simulating Martian conditions have used terrestrial samples as analogs [5,6]. During aqueous alteration, the development of secondary phases is highly dependent upon the parent material composition. There are significant compositional differences between Martian basalts and terrestrial analogs in several critical elements. For example, Baker et al. [6] used Columbia River Basalt as an analog to investigate hydrothermal alteration of basaltic shergottites. The Columbia River basalt composition used in that study differs significantly in Na, Mg, Ti and K compared to typical Martian basaltic rocks. Therefore, although terrestrial analogs have proven useful, they are not truly representative of likely Martian basalts.  There are several starting compositions that are of interest and most representative of Martian basalts. For example, basaltic shergottites are representative of specific Martian magmas and were among the first that we have synthesized.  The basaltic shergottites are separated into two compositions by high and low Al content. The high-Al basaltic shergottite composition is an average of the Los Angeles, EETA79001 (Lithology B) and QUE94201 meteorites. The low-Al basaltic shergottite composition is an average of the Shergotty, Zagami and EETA79001 (Lithology A) meteorites. Other compositions of interest include averaged Martian soil (recalculated on a S- and Cl-free basis) and low-S Pathfinder rock.  These compositions represent typical upper crust and Pathfinder surface rock compositions, respectively.  In some cases, these major element compositions also differ significantly when compared to terrestrial analogs, as shown on Table 1. Synthesis of Analog Material: Desired compositions of synthetic analogs were made by combination of oxide and gel components.  After homogenizing, the resulting mixtures are loaded into a sample container composed of gold-palladium (Au80Pd20) alloy. Experiments have shown gold-palladium far less likely to react with the sample. An average of three syntheses of the same desired composition using Au80Pd20 produced synthetic compositions that varied by only 1 to 9% in each major element when compared to the target composition. The alloy containers are then sealed in an evacuated glass chamber and lowered into an openended platinum wound furnace. During the melting process, redox conditions can be controlled and target oxygen fugacities such as those close to the FMQ buffer (for basaltic shergottites) can be achieved by controlling Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios present in the mixture. Once the mixtures are melted and depending on the amount of crystallinity desired, they can be dropped into a container of cold water to simulate quenching to obtain pure glass, or slowly lowered and cooled to control the crystallization of the sample. This procedure permits a wide range of textures that can be altered in the flow through apparatus.  Flow-Through Experiments: The characteristics of Martian water/rock interactions are poorly constrained and because of this, the experiments are conducted in an apparatus specifically designed to allow for variations in fluid and rock compositions, temperature, flow rate and fluid/rock ratios. A wide range of conditions appropriate to test the alteration models described above may therefore be evaluated.  Three sets of flow-through experiments are currently underway. The first set of experiments uses the Los Angeles meteorite composition to represent high-K Martian basalt. These basalts are being synthesized at a wide range of crystallinity to systematically investigate water/rock interactions. The second and third set of experiments use the averaged high-Al and low-Al basaltic shergottite compositions, respectively. In con SURFICIAL PROCESSES ON MARS:  N. J. Tosca et al.  strast to the first set of experiments, these compositions are being synthesized as pure basaltic glass to test palagonitization models. The flow-through experiments are being conducted at 25-75oC, but in the future, may be performed at higher or lower temperatures. Flow rates can be as low as ÂµL/hour or as high as several mL/min. using a multisyringe pump. Experiment lengths vary from several days to several weeks or even months and are run to a suitable completion suggested by XRD analyses and pH monitoring. Due to the relatively small amounts of sample (50100mg) that can be synthesized by the process explained above, the new apparatus has been designed accomodate these small samples. This design allows for larger fluid/rock ratios to be obtained as well as allowing for the smaller sample to be readily analyzed periodically by XRD. The apparatus allows for in-situ XRD analyses to be performed on the solid sample by removing the sample tubing at any point during the experiment and replacing it after the analysis. The section of tubing containing the solid sample is composed of Kapton X-ray amorphous tubing. This method of insitu XRD analysis permit the development of the primary mineralogy into a secondary mineralogy to be monitored which provides information on reaction progress. Several analyses in addition to XRD are performed to characterize the starting material as well as the residual solid left upon completion. These analyses include Electron microprobe, SEM, Mossbauer and FT-IR. The starting composition of the fluid is equilibrated with CO2 and N2 at varying pressures to simulate fluid interaction with a Martian atmosphere.  Dilute acid mixtures of H2SO4 and HCl are added to the fluid to reflect high S and Cl contents present in Martian soil. The effluent is collected in sequential aliquots and analyzed by DCP-AES and Ion Chromatography to permit geochemical modeling of fluid evolution as well as constrain a wide variety of the hydrological models proposed to explain the origin of Martian surface material. Applications to Mars: The chemistry and mineralogy of the Martian surface have been characterized by several spectroscopic and multispectral techniques including ground based telescopes, Hubble Space Telescope, Orbiters and Landers. In addition, alteration assemblages present in the SNC meteorites have provided insight for surficial processes on Mars [7]. Several alteration minerals have been suggested to exist on the surface of Mars, including magnesium sulfate minerals, based on the correlation of MgO and SO3 in rocks and soils at the Pathfinder site. Other secondary minerals have been suggested based on spectral evidence. Iron oxides are among the best constrained minerals based on Martian spectra and include phases such as hematite, maghemite and nanophase Fe-oxides. Palagonite, smectites, Fe-sulfates and other clay minerals are among several other minerals suggested based on spectral observations [2,3,8,9,10]. There still remains much to be done to arrive at a complete mineralogical characterization of Martian soils.  By duplicating proposed Martian groundwater systems, the nature of the surficial processes that may have operated on Mars to form these minerals can be better understood.  TABLE 1   Avg. High-Al Bas.
