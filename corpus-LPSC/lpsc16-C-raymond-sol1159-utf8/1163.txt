Introduction:  The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity encountered potassium-rich clastic sedimentary rocks along its traverse to Mount Sharp. Their chemical composition was analyzed using the ChemCam instrument that combines a LaserInduced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument [1, 2] and a Remote Micro-Imager (RMI) [3]. The first potassic sedimentary rocks were encountered in the uppermost member of the Yellowknife Bay (YKB) formation at three outcrops, namely Shaler, Rocknest, and Bathurst Inlet.  Their K2O abundance ranges between 0.7 and 1.1 wt% [4], which is significantly greater than that of the average Martian crust (0.45 wt%) [5]. The sedimentary rocks most enriched in potassium were encountered at two sites, the waypoints Cooperstown (sols 438 to 453) and Kimberley (sols 576 to 632) [6]. Here, we report a synthesis of the chemical composition of these rocks as seen by ChemCam according to their stratigraphic unit and facies at Cooperstown and Kimberley.  Stratigraphy and rocks facies:  The potassic rocks are primarily associated with two geomorphological units defined from orbit: a light-toned topographically variable, or "Rugged" map unit; and overlying light-toned striated rocks forming a "Striated" map unit [7] (Fig. 1).  Cooperstown (-4.62°N, 137.42°E) is associated with the Rugged unit and is topographically above the YKB formation [7-9]. Two units of the Cooperstown outcrop were investigated by ChemCam and correspond to massive fine and coarse sandstones (Fig. 1A). Kimberley (-4.64°N, 137.4°E) is a waypoint located at ~1 km to the southwest of Cooperstown, and is ~10 m higher in elevation. The Kimberley formation may also be stratigraphically above the Cooperstown outcrop [8,9]. The Kimberley formation is associated with both the Rugged unit and the Striated unit, and is divided into six members corresponding to massive and cross-bedded fine to very coarse sandstones, and conglomerates (Fig. 1B-1C). These rocks are interpreted to record fluvial or fluvio-deltaic depositional environments [7-10]. Chemical composition:  The composition in major elements of the potassic sedimentary rocks was determined using a revised calibration model of the ChemCam data (MOC data) [11] (Fig. 2A).  Fig. 1: Stratigraphy and facies of the potassic sedimentary rocks at Cooperstown and Kimberley. Elevations were estimated by K. Stack [9]. The number of points indicated refers to the number of ChemCam LIBS points collected for each unit/member and located in Fig. 1B for the Kimberley formation.  The sedimentary rocks at Cooperstown and Kimberley have a basaltic-like composition that primarily differs from the previously encountered sedimentary rocks in YKB or the conglomerates in Darwin [12] by their significantly higher content in K2O (Fig. 2A). Their overall mean K2O abundance is ~2.5 wt%, which is more than five times higher than that of the average Martian crust. Overall, abundances of major elements suggest the presence of a mixture of mafic minerals and K-bearing materials in each unit/member (Fig. 2).  Among the K-bearing materials, contents of SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O, and K2O, as well as K2O/Na2O ratios suggest a strong contribution of alkali feldspars including both anorthoclase and sanidine (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, these rocks have a mean K2O abundance and K2O/Na2O ratios that increase upward through the stratigraphic section (Fig. 1, 2A, and 2B). It suggests that the abundance of alkali feldspars and/or nearly pure K-feldspars also increases upward. An exception concerns the uppermost member of the Kimberley formation, the Beagle member that has the same chemical composition as the Cooperstown outcrop, possibly suggesting that they share common origins. The presence of sanidine in the Dillinger member is confirmed by the CheMin analyses at the Windjana drill site, reporting a content of 20 wt% of sanidine [13]. For the upper Dillinger and Mt. Remarkable members of the Kimberley formation, a weak correlation among abundances of K2O and MgO suggests that the K-bearing phases may include clay minerals or micas such as illite, or biotite (Fig. 2C). Lack of K in the amorphous material inferred from CheMin results [13] suggests that concentrations of K-rich phases in the amorphous material are likely limited.  The lower members of the Kimberley formation, which include Liga (northern Kimberley), Square Top, and the Point Coulomb members (4 of the 5 LIBS points) have high abundances of FeOT (Figs 2A and 2D). This is partly due to the presence of mafic silicate minerals, but likely also corresponds to the presence of Fe-oxides, Fe-oxyhydroxides, and/or Fephyllosilicates. Origins of the enrichment in K:  The potassium enrichment was likely not from diagenesis, but represents variable proportions of sediment from a rock source rich in potassium like a trachyte, originating from Gale crater's rim [6, 13]. Physical sorting may have also played a role in the enrichment in K of the Kimberley formation [6]. The potassic sedimentary rocks examined by the Curiosity rover provide yet additional records of the diversity of the past Martian magmatic activity. References:  [1] Wiens et al. (2012) Space Sci.
