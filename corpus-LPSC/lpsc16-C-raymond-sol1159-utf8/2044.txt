Introduction: The ChemCam instrument has the capability to study the chemical composition of soils at a sub-millimeter scale, thus providing an unpreceedented spatial resolution for their study. More than 300 soils have been sampled so far with ChemCam [1,2] and these targets are analyzed frequently in order to monitor any change in composition along the traverse. Detailed chemical analysis as a function of grain size is of great importance in order to better constrain soils formation. Curiosity is approaching the Bagnold Dunes, the first active dune field accessible for in-situ analyses. One of the main goal is to determine or constrain the dune material chemistry as well as its provenance [3]. This study is focusing on recent soils analyzed when approaching the dunes, for a comparison with previous soil targets, and with dunes specifically.   Methodology:  This study is using data from [4] as a reference for fine-grained soils (<500 microns, which is the laser spot size). Soil analyses acquired after sol 1150, getting closer to the Bagnold dunes, are considered in this study as new soils. In order to qualify a soil as fine-grained soil, we use a combination of three different techniques. These techniques combine the total intensity of the spectrum shot to shot, a multivariate ICA (Independent Component Analysis) Na vs H shot-to-shot, and a shot-to-shot H signal-to-background analysis. These three techniques have been described in previous studies and have shown to be useful to detect coarse grains in depth [5,6]. Here we are reporting on both fine-grained soils (<500 µm) and coarser grains in a separate comparison with previous studies.  Results:  Ten new soil targets have been analyzed between sol 1155 and 1184. Eight of them correspond to soils with ripples (Pinckney, Arris_Drift, Fish_River, Abbabis, Sinclair, Karibib, Barby_ccam3 and Kibnas_ccam3) whereas two are disturbed soils (Hoanib and Awasib). MAHLI images on Barby show grains that are mostly <500 µm in size [7]. Most of them are dark, with a few bright components. A list of points considered in this study is presented in Table 1.  Comparison between fine-grained soils We have compared the chemical compositions of these finegrained soils with the previous ones observed along the traverse. For these comparisons, the sums of oxides are not normalized, because ChemCam does not quantify yet the content of volatiles such as S, H, Cl, which are known to be at a few % level in soils. Comparing the sum of oxides of previous fine-grained soils and the recent ones, the first striking observation is that some of the lately analyzed soils present a higher sum of oxides, which mean they contain less volatiles. Figure 1 shows the sum of oxides for previous fine-grained soils, with an average at 87.5 wt % +/- 3 %. Sinclair, Abbabis, Fish_River, and Barby_ccam3 have an average total of oxides similar to the previous soils. But concerning Pinckney, Arris_Drift, Sinclair, Hoanib, Awasib and Kibnas, they have an average sum of oxides that is significantly higher than what has been previously analyzed. This would suggest that these soils are less hydrated and probably less altered than previous ones.  Figure 1 : Sum of oxides for previous soil analyses and new soils close to the Bagnold dunes.  The ratio between the chemical composition of the recent fine-grained soils and the previous ones shows that the largest difference between them concerns the K2O content (Figure 2). This oxide is at least 20 % larger in the recent soils, except for Abbabis and Fish_River that have a similar content than usual previous soils. Soils with highest K2O content are Awasib and Sinclair, 200 % higher than the average of previous soils, with an average content ranging from 0.52 to 0.62 % (average of K2O in previous soils being 0.27 %). Soils with unusually high K2O content present also enrichment in Na2O as well as Al2O3. New soils show overall a slight enrichment in SiO2 as well as FeO. Most of the recent soils present also an enrichment in Li, which seems to be correlated with the alkali content.  All these new soils correspond to targets within ripples, as already encountered earlier along the traverse, such as at Rocknest, Hidden Valley, Pahrump. Dingo Gap, a ripple, can also be taken into account as an aeo lian deposit. When comparing the new fine-grained soils with previous aeolian deposits (Figure 3), the enrichment in alkali is still observed, even if a larger dispersion is observed at the Rocknest site, due to the higher presence of coarse grains that may have contaminated the local fine soils [6].  Figure 2 : Chemical composition of new fine-grained soils ratioed to the average of previous soil analyses taken as reference. Red dashed line is the ratio to 1.  Figure 3 : K2O content compared for different aeolian deposits along the traverse. Previous ones are in blue and recent ones (close to Bagnold Dunes) are in pink.  Comparison between the coarse grains Even if the recent soils are overall fine-grained, MAHLI images have  shown the presence of some coarser grains, which are actually 1 mm maximum in size. In the ChemCam analyses, some coarse grains have been analyzed, but their detection has been more difficult than in previous soils, and therefore they seem to be pretty small. The composition of these coarser grains has been compared with the composition of former coarse grains studied in [6] using the latest calibration [8]. From figure 4, it seems that no felsic coarse grains have been detected lately. One coarse grain, point #4 of the Abbabis soil, corresponds to a CaSO4 grain. Coarse grains analyzed between sol 1155 and 1169 seem to correspond to the "mafic group" (blue dashed line), showing a lower content in SiO2, FeO but higher MgO content than the "intermediate group" (green dashed line). This could suggest the presence of an olivine component, as detected by the passive observations [9]. Coarse grains analyzed more recently (from sol 1174) seem to correspond better to the "intermediate group", showing a basaltic composition enriched in alkali. This is a first order comparison, because overall these coarse grains show a higher FeO and K2O contents than the previous ones. Table 1: List of new soils considered in this study, with sol number as well as points that have sampled fine-grained soils.  Figure 4 : Comparison of compositions of coarse grains from this study with previous ones observed along the traverse. Coarse grains on X axis (from 0 to 14) are Pinckney #2, #3, #7, #8, #9, #10, Arris_Drift #3, Abbabis #4, #5, Sinclair #1, #3, Hoanib #9, Awasib #4, Barby_ccam3 # 4, Kibnas #4.   Discussion:  We have observed in recent finegrained soils an enrichment in SiO2, FeO and alkali compared to previous soils. Local rocks are actually enriched in FeO as well as alkali. The composition of these soils seems therefore to be related to a contamination by local rocks due to erosion. Some coarser grains could correspond to an olivine component. This analysis is on-going and will be detailed as the dedicated Bagnold Dunes campaign starts [10]. We will also report in the hydratation level of the dunes. References: [1] Wiens et al.
