Recorded in soils is information about parent material, the effect of impacts, aeolian and fluvial transport, chemical weathering from both ancient and modern Mars, and addition and loss of material.  Analysis of soils can therefore provide important information about the history of Mars.    Soil-forming processes in desert soils on Earth are preserved in the chemistry and morphology of those soils.  Desert soils often contain desert pavement, an interlocking layer of rocks on the surface of the soil, and a dust-rich layer termed the Av horizon beneath the desert pavement [1].  Desert pavement can indicate age, with a more interlocking pavement indicating greater age [2].  Increasing age also results in a thicker dust-rich layer (Av horizon) beneath the desert pavement [2].  This dust-rich layer preserves not only the composition of the deposited aeolian dust, but also evidence of any interactions with liquid water.  The dust-rich layer also strongly affects how liquid water interacts with soils.     Soils on Earth, including desert soils, can be studied by analyzing depth profiles such as in soil pits or augered samples.  Changes with depth on Earth have been used to interpret profiles dominated by immobility of elements, depletion of elements, depletion followed by enrichment of elements, addition of elements and biogenic impacts [3].  Depth profiles can also indicate information about soils such as the age of the soils, characteristics of interaction with liquid water, and composition of deposited dust.   ChemCam measurements at Gale Crater, Mars form depth profiles over different scales, including fine scale profiles formed by repeated shots in one location, as well as across transects of vertically exposed material, such as the example shown in Figures 1 and 2.  Previous work on depth profiles resulting from repeated ChemCam shots in the same location has shown the presence of Mn-rich weathering rinds interpreted to indicate oxidation conditions [4], as well as, in one case, weathering indicated by mobility of Li [5].   Here, in order to examine potential soil-forming processes at Gale Crater, we examine transects at the millimeter scale measured by ChemCam through vertical soil exposures.       Methods:  First, NavCam images of ChemCam targets were examined through sol 1062.  From these images, steep to nearly vertical soils were identified visually, such as the example shown in Figures 1 and 2.    Figure 1.

For these ten targets, elemental concentrations across the soil face were examined from ChemCam measurements available on the Planetary Data System (PDS) (https://pds.nasa.gov/).   Results and discussion: Multiple profiles show evidence of slight Fe enrichment closer to the surface of the depth profile than deeper in the depth profile.  Although slight, the multiple occurrences suggest the presence of a process that should be investigated further.    Iron concentration versus depth for the target Soda, which is one of the targets that shows this feature, is shown in Figure 3.  We propose that this Fe enrichment closer to the top of the profile may result from Fe-rich material at the surface such as nanophase Fe-oxides found in martian dust [6], transported downward.    Dust deposition could also result in finer material observed beneath pebble surfaces at Rocknest [7, 8] and other locations at Gale Crater.      150 148 146 144 142 140 138 136 134 132 130 128 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  FeO T E sti ma te d d ep th ( mm )Figure 3.  Plot of Fe concentration versus estimated depth for the Soda target.  Error bars indicate one standard deviation as reported in the PDS, and depth was estimated from image analysis.    These data correspond to the images in Figures 1 and 2, with the deepest depth corresponding to ChemCam point 1, and the shallowest depth corresponding to point 5.   The slightly higher concentration of Fe nearer the surface is characteristic of multiple profiles examined, and may reflect transport of Fe-rich material from the surface downward.      This possible process could be similar to that which, in desert soils on Earth, causes a dust-rich soil layer (the Av horizon) beneath desert pavement [1].   In these terrestrial desert soils, dust is trapped beneath pebbles on the surface, causing the gradual inflation of the landscape.  Importantly, on Earth such dust-rich horizons record not just the accumulated dust and age of the soil, but also show chemical alteration of the dust, with changes such as translocated salts deeper in the profiles indicating the rates and amount of water movement and chemical weathering [9].  Further examination of soils on Mars therefore has potential to similarly help interpret the past history of that planet.   Many of the soil profiles show concentrations that are relatively consistent from top to bottom, indicative of relatively homogeneous soil compositions at that scale.  In addition, as previously shown [10, 11], multiple measurements also indicate grains of different compositions, indicating the importance of original parent material on soil formation on Mars.   Conclusions and future work: In this review of variation in chemistry with depth at ten sites, similar trends were observed at multiple sites, suggesting that this approach may be a valuable application of ChemCam data in interpreting soils at Gale Crater. Slight enrichment in Fe nearer the soil surface is observed in multiple profiles, suggesting it may result from a process that should be investigated further.  It is potentially consistent with Fe-rich material at the surface such as nanophase Fe-oxides found in martian dust [6], transported downward.  On Earth, deposition of dust in desert soils forms dust-rich horizons that record the age of the soil, the composition of the deposited dust, and potential water: rock interactions and chemical weathering [9].  Examination of soils on Mars therefore has potential to similarly help interpret its history.   More work is needed to further interpret soilforming processes on Mars.  Future work will include analysis of additional measurements from the MSL ChemCam instrument and comparison of analyzed soil surfaces and measured dust with soil profiles, as well as an investigation of soil variability.  Examination of possible Fe enrichment may also help better understand secondary materials previously observed in soils at Gale Crater [12, 7, 10, 13-16], thereby helping further interpret the past history of Mars.
