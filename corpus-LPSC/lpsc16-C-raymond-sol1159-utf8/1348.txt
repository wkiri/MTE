Introduction: ChemCam consists of two instruments on the Curiosity rover: a Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) and a very high resolution Remote Micro-Imager (RMI) for context imaging. LIBS is able to analyze elemental compositions of rocks and soils at distances from 1.5 to 7 meters by acquiring their light emission, and to detect most of major elements [1] and many minor elements such as Li, Sr, Ba, and Rb [2]. 30 shots are usually performed to investigate a given point. Ollila et al., quantified the abundances of these trace elements using a partial least squares algorithm which is a linear multivariate regression method, and univariate calibration using an earlier laboratory calibration data set to infer element ratios by ratioing peak areas. Here, these calibrations are reviewed using an improved lab database and various univariate calibrations. Relatively high abundances of Li, Sr, Ba and Rb are reported at several locations at Gale Crater, mostly linked to high K2O concentrations.  Laboratory databases: The original LIBS calibration data (66 standards [2]) was obtained with the ChemCam flight model. After Curiosity's landing data was taken on 429 geological standards with a replica of ChemCam at Los Alamos National Laboratory under a simulated Martian atmosphere (PCO2 ~ 6.9mbar). The compositions of the standards have been analyzed using electron microprobe and ICP-MS  and are considered homogeneous. This new database has a larger diversity of standards than those used in Ollila et al [2]. They are representative of several kinds of sediments, sulfates, ores, metamorphic and igneous rocks. Their compositional range overlaps the Mars data more, to better constrain the calibrations. Trace element quantification: The ChemCam instrument acquires LIBS emission spectra with three spectrometers; each element or molecule is specific to at least one and usually many emission lines. The most stable emission line(s) of trace elements are selected for peak area calculation [3]. The LIBS lines of 671, 421.7, 780.2 and 455.3 nm, representative of Li, Sr, Rb and Ba respectively, were selected as they present the least interferences with other element lines and their intensities are proportional to their abundances. For each standard, which are usually pressed powder disks, five different locations are analyzed for LIBS analyses. An Earth-to-Mars correction has been first performed. After pre-processing and normalization to the total emission by spectral range [4,5], these peaks were fitted using a Voigt function. The calculated areas that are lower than 3 times the standard deviation of the background noise level are not included for the calibration. The five spectra are then averaged for each sample, and standard deviations (σ) are obtained. Except for barium, all data points have an average signal > 4σ. Composition and peak area for each element are then available and calibration curves are obtained for Li (a linear function passing through the origin), Sr, Rb and Ba (all quadratic functions passing through the origin) (see Fig. 1).         Figure 1: Univariate calibration curves of (a) Li using the 671 nm emission line, (b) Sr using the 421.7nm emission line and (c) Rb using the 780.2nm emission line. Each data point is the average ± standard deviation of five measurements per standard.   The accuracy, the Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSE) are 6.4 ppm for Li, 131 ppm for Sr, 46 ppm for Rb and 212 ppm for Ba while RMSE for Ollila et al [2] univariate calibrations are respectively 40, 170, 50 and 640 ppm. Thus, the new lab database is more accurate than the old one. The precision is however better to consider than the accuracy [1]. Trace element detection on Mars : Applying these calibrations to actual CheCam data, the range of predicted values is mostly overlapping with the distribution of standard composition. Using these new univariate calibrations, the average content in these minor elements observed along Curiosity traverse is close to the Earth crustal average, except for Rb and Ba respectively lower and higher on Earth (equal to the 1st quara b c  tile and to the 3rd quartile on Mars respectively) as shown on  Figure 2 [6].      Figure 2. Box plots of Li, Sr, Rb and Ba content (ppm) along Curiosity traverse in log scale. On each box, the Gale average is the red line, the lower edge is the first quartile and the upper the third quartile. The black lines on each side of the boxes extends to the most extreme values except the outliers which are shown by the red crosses. The blue diamonds are the mean terrestrial crust abundances [6].  Using the calibration curves described above, most of the Li data at Gale are  < 30 ppm, which corresponds to the range observed in mafic rocks on Earth [7]. A maximum Li content of 91 ppm was detected in Marquette (point 3), a dark-toned rock with a moderate abundances of Al2O3, at 13wt. %, and FeO (18.8 wt.%).  Most of Gale Sr data are between 100 and 500 ppm which corresponds to the range in shales, mafic and granitic rocks on Earth [7].  The maximum value is 18,880ppm in a white vein Soledad_Pass (point 9). This value is poorly constrained since the laboratory database does not contain any standard with such a high Sr content (highest value is 1370). Carrara displays one point with 2640 ppm of Sr located in a white crystal enriched in potassium (K2O = 3.1wt. %).  Most of Gale Rb data are lower than 100ppm which corresponds to the range observed in mafic rocks, intermediate to felsic sandstones and carbonates on Earth [7]. The maximum Rb of 1386ppm was analyzed in Frome_Rock (point 5), a pebble in a soil containing 5.7wt. % of K2O.  The majority of Ba data are between 100 and 500 ppm which corresponds to the range in mafic rocks and K-bearing sediments on Earth [7]. The maximum Ba is 1640 ppm in Sledgers, a whitish rock identified as a trachyte in [8], with typically high K2O (3 wt. %), SiO2 (~66 wt. %) and Al2O3 (21 wt. %) content.  Enriched targets on Mars : Most of the enriched Sr-Rb-Ba targets are located in the Kimberley area where many sedimentary rocks are enriched in K2O [8]. For these specific points, no decrease with depth is observed in the shot by shot analyses, attesting that these enrichments are not due to a coating effect. Rubidium and barium are lithophile elements that can subsitute for potassium while strontium can preferentially replace calcium. There is a positive correlation between these elements: Rb and/or Ba-rich rocks are mostly K-rich rocks (K2O>2wt. %). Many of these targets are also enriched in aluminium and silicon. Rocks enriched in Sr are usually high in Na, K and Al. This suggests a mixing of plagioclases albite-like and K-felspars. RMI images show that targets enriched in these elements are mostly light-toned grains or clasts. Thus, these high Rb, Ba and Sr targets appear to be Kfeldspars and plagioclases. The exception is an ironrich vein (Soledad Pass point 9), which has a high Sr content while CaO and K2O are low. The poorest Sr, Rb or Ba contents are present in K-depleted targets (<0.5 wt. %). The distribution of Sr, Rb, and Ba on Mars seems to be related to K-bearing minerals.  The lithium is lithophile as well but more upiquitous: it may substitute K and also Fe, Na, Mg, or Al. The Li-rich targets are mostly iron and manganese rich. Shot to shot analyses usually rule out coatings. However, a positive correlation with depth between Li and Fe-Mn is often observed. Moreover, Frome_Rock point 5 is particularly rich in K2O content with 5.6 wt.% and in Rb with 1386ppm. This suggests that lithium is associated with a K and Fe-rich phase that contains relatively high Rb content: that illustrates well Li-K and Li-Fe substitutions.  Conclusion: These new univariate calibrations give strontium, rubidium, barium and lithium contents in Gale crater with higher accuracy: RMSEs are lower than Ollila's [2] and the new database covers better the distribution of Martian composition.  Rb, Ba and Sr-rich Martian targets are almost always associated with elevated K2O content. Mostly, these contain K-felspars. The highest abundances in these trace elements are even higher than terrestrial continental crust enriched in felsic and grantic rocks. This supports the presence of felsic materials as described in Sautter et al. [8]. However, the average of Rb, Ba, Li and Sr contents on Mars are closer to a mafic and sediments moderalty alkali on Earth. The samplings along Curiosity traverse would be mostly felsic sediments and rocks - soils with mafic origin. References: [1] Wiens R.C. et al. (2013) Spectrochim.
