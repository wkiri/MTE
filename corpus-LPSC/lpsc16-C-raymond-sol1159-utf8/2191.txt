Introduction: Obtaining quantitative chemical information from LIBS spectra is challenging due to variability in the bulk compositions of geological materials and sampling conditions, especially on Mars [1,2]. In particular, chemical matrix effects [3] may result in emission peak areas that are not directly proportional to element concentrations. This complicates univariate analyses of individual element peaks in LIBS spectra. Multivariate analyses (MVA) can alleviate some of the problems introduced by matrix effects by incorporating a broad spectral range rather than a single peak, thereby utilizing all the possible predictive information in each spectrum. In this study, we assess the potential for improvements in accuracy of univariate and multivariate elemental predictions by testing models that use only spectral regions known to contain peaks arising from the element of interest. By limiting the calibration data to element-specific "masked" regions, element peaks are more prominently represented in the models, which might improve prediction accuracy. We test four permutations of elemental prediction accuracy for both major and minor elements. 1) Univariate analyses of individual peaks specific to each element, as is typically done in many LIBS applications where only a single matrix is employed;  2) MVA of the same peaks (from #1 above) for each element, as used successfully by Olilla [5] in predicting Li, Ba, Sr, and Rb;  3) Univariate and multivariate analyses of a wavelength range selected for each element by an automated algorithm; and  4) MVA predictions using unmasked spectra - i.e., the entire spectral region.  Samples and Data: Samples for this study included a suite of 175 samples doped with varying amounts of trace elements [3] as well as additional samples from a wide range of rock types [4]. LIBS spectra were acquired from 50 shots on each of 6 locations on pressed powder pellets using a Mars-analog LIBS instrument under a 7-Torr CO2 atmosphere and 1.6, 2.5, and 3.5 mJ/pulse. Data were processed using software with steps analogous to those used for ChemCam data [4], including normalization to each of three wavelength regions of the three spectrometers. We also used an algorithm that customizes baseline removal to each individual element as described in [6].  Univariate (linear least squares) or multivariate (partial least-squares, PLS) analyses of LIBS spectra were used to predict major (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Si, Ti) and trace (Ni, Co, Cr, Zn, Mn) element concentrations with and without wavelength masks. Major element masks were chosen using a subset of samples that represents a wide range in major element concentrations. For trace elements, we used spectra of samples doped with varying amounts of trace elements [3]. For all of these samples, concentrations of major and trace elements were measured independently by XRF. Masking: We tested three different schemes for selecting channels to use in our predictions: channels highly-correlated to the element being predicted, channels selected by a sweep routing, and all channels. For Scheme 1, correlation coefficients (r 2) between concentration and the spectral intensity at each wavelength were used to choose the regions used in subsequent analyses. When available, the top 10-11 peaks with the highest r 2 values were used as the wavelength masks. Each wavelength region was chosen to include the entire peak and its shoulders to maximize the information used in predictions. Spectra of some elements (K, Mg, Na, and Si) did not contain many identifiable peaks. In those cases, we selected as many peaks as possible that were identified by the r 2 calculation and were relevant regions of the spectra for the element of interest (Table 1). For Scheme 2, we designed an algorithm to sweep through all 5465 channels of data and select the single region that produced the optimal RMSE for each element using univariate analysis. For Scheme 3 models, we used all 5465 channels. Results: Table 1 shows that for any given element, the strongest emission lines selected by Scheme 1 are not necessarily the best to use for univariate predictions. For example, the neutral Si line at 288.2 nm is one of the strongest Si lines over the UV-NIR region studied here. It produces a prediction error of Â±14.11 wt%SiO2, while much smaller Si III and Si IV lines ca. 456.8 and 408.9 nm, respectively, produce better accuracy. Vagaries of line selection are likely due to overlapping lines from the many other elements present in geological samples. Considerable and time-consuming experimentation is clearly necessary to obtain optimal results in such complicated matrices.  Scheme 2 (Table 2) produced considerably better (more accurate) results than Scheme 1, showing that  human intervention in selecting appropriate peaks for univariate analysis is not necessarily optimal.  Comparisons of root mean square errors (RMSE) for PLS MVA analyses of each element with and with out masking are shown in Table 3. For all major elements except Fe, PLS produces improved accuracy with unmasked data. In contrast, for all minor elements except Zn, masking gives the best results.   Table 2.

This result is expected given the wide range of matrix compositions in our geologically-relevant calibration suite. Univariate analyses based on an optimized wavelength range for each element (the sweep algorithm) show improved accuracy over univariate predictions based on individual peaks (Scheme 1). However, in all cases except Zn, optimal PLS predictions are more accurate than univariate. Finally, there is generally little difference in PLS prediction accuracy between masked and unmasked data for most elements. This suggests that there is actually no extra information in the rest of the spectrum, or more likely, that the information is redundant to that contained in the masked peak regions. Table 3.
