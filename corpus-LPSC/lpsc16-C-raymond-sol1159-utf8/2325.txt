Introduction: ChemCam, the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument on the Martian rover Curiosity, samples a 350-500 µm spot on the surface of its target at a distance of 1.5-7 m using a laser to ablate material and ignite a plasma [1,2]. Atomic, ionic, and molecular emission from the plasma is collected and used to determine the elemental composition of the sampled material [3]. Calcium sulfates have been identified with this technique in light-toned veins [e.g., 4,5] as well as elevated Cl in some rocks, possibly in chlorides [6,7]. Salts are left behind as evidence of the aqueous chemistry of past waters, providing indications of past environmental conditions. Our objective is to improve techniques for detecting dispersed salts at lower concentrations in the bulk rock, in addition to salt-bearing veins.  Detection of salts in the presence of additional components from the bulk rock using LIBS can be complicated by physical and chemical matrix effects that may alter the resulting spectra. This is a concern particularly for salt anion identification because elements such as C, S, and Cl have high ionization energies, 2-3× greater than the major cation elements, and therefore produce weaker emission lines. To assess the potential for detecting and quantifying carbonates, sulfates, and chlorides in the presence of a basaltic background, we perform LIBS analysis on a set of prepared salt+basalt mixtures at various concentrations.   Methods:  Powdered K1919, a moderate-alkali basalt, was physically mixed with the following salts at concentrations of 0.5 (included in the underlined mixtures only), 5, 10, 30, 50 and 70 wt. % salt:  CaCO3, MgCO3, CaSO4·2H2O, Fe2(SO4)3, MgSO4, Na2SO4, CaCl2, and NaCl. To test the effects of an alternative matrix, CaSO4·2H2O and NaCl were also mixed with GBW07105, a high-alkali basalt. Pressed pellets of the samples were analyzed with the ChemCam-analog instrument at Los Alamos National Laboratory under Mars conditions [as described further in 8]. Two different versions of data processing were applied: (1) "minimal processing," excluding a global continuum removal and normalization, and (2) standard ChemCam processing [9], which includes a global continuum removal and normalization to the total integrated intensity of the VNIR spectral window (490-850 nm). Both methods also included a final, local continuum fit specific to lines of interest. Analysis was performed on the median spectra of 45 shots from 5 sample locations, excluding the initial 5 shots from each spot to exclude potential surface effects.  C, S, and Cl lines from the ChemCam Quick Element Search Tool (C-QuEST) [10] and lines in their surrounding wavelength regions were fit using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to a model composed of Lorentzian functions for all visible peaks and an underlying linear continuum. This peak shape and a linear continuum were chosen as the simplest case to limit the number of free parameters. Emission lines were deemed useful for univariate analysis of salt+basalt mixtures if they met the following criteria: (1) anion line strength increased monotonically with salt concentration above some low-concentration threshold, (2) the line of interest appeared sufficiently free from interference that it could be fit with our model, and (3) comparisons between mixtures, including those not containing the element in question, supported the line identity as being that of the anion.

In a few cases, including for Cl lines at 507.9 and 510.1 nm, fitting lines in the absence of the global continuum removal improved the detectability of lines relative to our previous results [8]. Also, several anion lines previously identified as useful based on controlled lab samples [e.g., 11-12] did not meet the criteria here, mainly due to interference from additional elements in the geologic matrix. Lines observed in multiple mixture compositions (bold in Table 1) and in additional samples from the literature (indicated with check marks) are robust to sample composition and are likely to be the most effective in detecting carbonates, sulfates, and chlorides in targets of unknown composition on the Martian surface.   Figure 1 highlights some of the best lines selected for their spectral isolation, appearance in all relevant mixtures in this work, and previous observations in the literature.  Spectra and calibration curves in Fig. 1 show an increase in the emission line strength with salt concentration. The detection threshold of dispersed salts in basaltic targets varies from ~5-10 to 30 wt. % salt for most Cl lines selected and from 30 to 50 wt. % salt for most C and S lines selected. The particular C line in Fig. 1 is enhanced at 5 wt. % salt relative to pure basalt but insensitive to changes in concentration until >30 wt. %. Work is ongoing to further understand these thresholds. All three elements may be detectable in sandstone with pore spaces (14-49 % [14]) completely filled with salt. For Cl, lower salt content due to fluids passing through and coating grains or only partially filling pore spaces may also be detectable. The sensitivity of the selected lines to changes in salt concentration allows for quantitative analysis. Calibration curves are shown for two different versions of data processing. The minimally processed data produced curves that vary for different sample materials in our laboratory study. However, standard ChemCam processing techniques, in particular normalization to the total intensity of the spectral window, reduce these differences. The distinct behavior of the 545.5 nm line in Fe2(SO4)3 at high concentrations may be due to interference from the Fe line at 545.7 nm. We continue to investigate calibration curve dependence on cation and matrix composition, effects of data processing techniques, and how our results relate to previous work. Conclusions:  Multiple emission lines of C, S, and Cl were identified in the LIBS spectra and found to be sensitive to salt concentration irrespective of cation or basaltic matrix. Above detection thresholds, lines increase monotonically, creating the potential for at least semi-quantitative analysis. Absolute quantification may prove more challenging as our results suggest that  Figure 1: Examples of "best" Cl, C, and S lines that met criteria for salt+basalt samples in our set (see 'Methods').

Calibration curves based on data with (center column) "minimal processing," no global continuum removal or normalization applied, and (right column) "standard ChemCam processing," global continuum removal and normalization to the total integrated intensity of the VNIR spectral window (norm=1). For the mixture compositions, 'KB' refers to K1919 and 'GB' refers to GBW07105.    calibration curves may depend on the composition of the sample material in ways that are not yet fully understood. Nevertheless, as a survey tool, ChemCam should be able to track relative changes in dispersed salt content using select Cl, C, and S emission lines to distinguish between evaporite and siliciclastic layers for detailed follow-up in collaboration with Curiosity's suite of in-situ compositional analysis instruments.
