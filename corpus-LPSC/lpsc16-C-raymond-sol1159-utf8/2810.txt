Introduction: The Mars 2020 mission builds upon the discoveries from the Curiosity Mars rover and the two Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, to enhance our understanding of Mars' potential as a habitat for past or present life. The rover will use its own instruments on Mars for visual, mineralogical, and chemical analysis down to a microscopic scale to identify candidate features that may have been formed by past life, as well as other features of geological interest. It will also collect and package a carefully selected set of samples for possible return to Earth by a future mission. The NASA Mars 2020 rover will carry a Panoramic Camera System ("Mastcam-Z" [1]) to obtain multispectral stereoscopic panoramic images. Mastcam-Z will be based directly on the successful Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mast Camera (Mastcam). MastcamZ will have all of the capabilities of the MSL/Mastcam instruments, but augmented by a 3.6:1 zoom capability that will significantly enhance its stereoscopic imaging performance for both science and rover navigation support. Mastcam-Z is a matched pair of zoom CCD cameras that each provide road-band red/green/blue (RGB), narrow-band visible/near-infrared (VNIR) color, and direct solar images with fields of view from 5° to 15°, with the ability to resolve (across 4-5 pixels) features about 1 mm in size in the near field and about 3-4 cm in size at 100 m distance [1]. Within the framework of the Mastcam-Z project, the contribution by our team to the mission consists of three main components. . 3D Vision: instrument design and calibration support and ongoing 3D reconstructions of stereo data during the mission  . Visualization: develop and provide a 3D visualization tool for scientific data analysis. . Scientific Exploitation: characterization of the overall landscape geomorphology, processes, and the nature of the geologic record using the reconstructed 3D models. Challenges for 3D Vision Processing: Unlike earlier flown camera solutions, such as the Mars Exploration Rover Mission (MER) Pancam or the MSL Mastcam, Mastcam-Z will contain a zoom facility, which - besides the focusing mechanism - inserts a second degree of freedom in the physical selection of the optical set-up. This may lead to stereo constellations with different focal length in both images. Another immensely challenging processing scenario are wide baseline panoramas where more distant outcrops are imaged multiple times from different points of the rover traverse while preserving the same object size in the images using the zoom. (This leads to much higher geometric accuracy in 3D in larger distances compared to fixed stereo configurations). The mentioned issues require an optimal calibration of the cameras, the stereo set-up and the zoom however this cannot be assumed to be static after launch and especially landing. Therefore one of the greatest challenges is a constant check and re-calibration of these parameters without physical access or available ground truth.  3D Vision Processing Solution: Planetary Robotics Vision Processing (PRoVIP) as Heritage from ExoMars PanCam and European Research Projects: The processing framework PRoViP was initially developed within the EU FP7-SPACE Project PRoVisG with the intention to establish an extensible framework for vision processing in planetary robotic missions performing image processing on selected sets of input data, at the request of a client. The client allows the user to select the data to be processed, choose and configure the desired workflow, start the actual processing, and collect the results. Examples of processing products and capabilities are: a) Digital Elevation Models, b) Ortho images, c) 3D meshes, d) Derived thematic maps of the surrounding describing reconstruction accuracy, occlusions, solar illumination, slopes, roughness, hazards etc. e) Fusion rover and orbiter based images, f) Support of multiple missions and sensors, g) MSL Mastcam stereo products (Fig. 1).   Figure 1: 3D rendered MSL Mastcam stereo processing results at subcentimeter resolution.  Visualization Tool for Planetary Robotics 3D viewing (PRo3D): This interactive 3D viewer allows to virtually explore reconstructed Martian terrain and to perform geologic analysis. For that various measurement and annotation tools are provided to:  a) Delineate geological boundaries b) Get the true dimension of geological features c) Obtain linear and projected distances between surface points d) Calculate dip & strike values of stratigraphic layers. An example of a full geologic interpretation using these tools is shown in Fig. 2.   Figure 2: Detailed interpretation of the stratigraphy at the Shaler outcrop, showing the main stratigraphic boundaries as red and blue lines, bedset boundaries as thick white lines, and laminations within those bedsets as the thin white lines. The dip and strike values are color-coded by dip value, and generally dip 15° - 20° to the southeast, however, this requires validation. The findings are consistent with those in [3] [4] in that the outcrop represents a fluvial environment, with recessive, fine-grained units interlayered with coarse, pebbly units.

Geology use cases drive software design: PRoViP and PRo3D targeted development for Mastcam-Z has started early in 2016. To specify new features of 3D vision processing and visualization, a set of geologic use cases are being compiled and will be refined with further knowledge about the Mars 2020 landing sites. From the point of view of the present team, the new capabilities of the Mastcam-Z instrument and software will be of great interest in the study of centimeter- and millimeter- to submillimeter-sized features of impact craters on Mars, possibly allowing the identification and study of impact breccias and their clast population, as well as the possible detection (for the first time) of shatter cones, with implications for shock metamorphic studies on Mars. This will also have implications for comparison with Martian meteorite studies.
