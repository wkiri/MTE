  IS CRUSTAL SULFATE ASSIMILATION A POTENTIAL KEY TO UNDERSTANDING REDOX DIVERSITY AMONG THE SHERGOTTITES? A.S. Bell1 (asbell@unm.edu) and  C.K. Shearer1,1Institute of Meteoritics, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque New Mexico 87131  Introduction: The inferred oxidation state of shergottite magmas span a substantial range of values. These values range from approximately ΔIW+0 for the primitive olivine phyric Yamato 980459 to the highly oxidized values of ΔIW+7 that have been suggested for the "augite basalt" North West Africa 8159. Although the extremes values of this range are quite disparate, the majority of the estimated fO2 values for the basaltic and olivine phyric shergottites fall within a narrower window of ΔIW+0 to ΔIW+3. The origin of the redox diversity displayed by the shergottites is still a matter of some debate. Much of this debate centers on the extent to which the shergottites have inherited their redox signatures from their mantle source, and subsequently, to what extent these "primitive" mantle redox signatures have been be overprinted by post-melting petrologic processes.  The inferred redox history of the LREE enriched, olivine phyric shergottite LAR 06319 illustrates how the redox conditions under which the shergottites crystallize are not necessarily static. A detailed study of LAR 06319 revealed that earliest phases crystallized from melt record a reduced fO2 redox signature, whereas, the late crystallizing phase assemblages record substantially more oxidized fO2 values [1].   Common magmatic processes such as compositional differentiation, volatile degassing, and assimilation of oxidized crustal materials have all been proposed as possible oxidation mechanism in shergottite magmas, however, details concerning the viability and efficiency of the  hypothesized oxidation mechanisms are still poorly quantified. Of the proposed mechanisms, crustal assimilation is perhaps the least explored and understood. We hypothesize that assimilation of crustal materials contain sulfates may be an important and powerful oxidant of the shergottite magmas. This mechanism may be important for several reasons. First, occurrences of Ca-Fe-Mg sulfate minerals have been observed by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) ChemCam instrument [2]. These sulfates are interpreted to be diagenetic in origin and have been speculated to be a ubiquitous component of the Martian crust. Secondly, sulfur isotopic data from a suite of shergottites suggest the S-isotopic signature of many of the enriched shergottites reflects an atmospheric component that is related to surficial chemical weathering processes. The Δ 33 S values measured for some of the enriched shergottites are believed to represent the geochemical signature of the assimilation of crustal materials into the shergottite magmas. Based on a combination of the fact that that sulfate appears to be abundant constituent of the martian crust, as well as established sulfur isotopic arguments for crustal contamination, we suggest that the reaction of crustal sulfate minerals some shergottite magmas may be in important factor in contributing their redox evolution. In this abstract we explore the assimilation of oxidized crustal sulfur as a potential mechanism producing        Exploring Assimilation of Crustal Sulfate as a Redox Mechanism:  The chemical potential of oxygen in Fe bearing silicate melts is controlled the homogenous redox reaction:  FeO melt + 0.25O2 system = FeO1.5 melt   As Fe is the dominant heterovalent cation in the basaltic melts, this reaction clearly shows that fO2 of the melt is defined by the ratio of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ present in the melt. Therefore any changes in this ratio will be manifested as changes in the numerical fO2 value for the melt.  Crystalline sulfates are well known to react with silicate liquids; these reactions are important for industrial glass manufacturing and been studied extensively in the glass science literature [3].    Sulfates dissolve into silicate melts according following equilibria:   2FeO melt + CaSO4  = CaO melt + 2FeO1.5 melt +SO2 fluid  if the oxygen fugacity of the system lies out of the SO2 stability field, then this component is consumed via:  FeO melt + SO2 fluid = FeS melt + 2FeO1.5 melt   Dissolution of sulfate into the melt as described by the reactions above causes a net increase in the molar ratio of ferric to ferrous iron in the melt, which in turn increases fO2. Although the reactions above do not explicitly show it, the increase in the ferric-ferrous ratio is related to the following homogenous speciation reaction in the melt:    (SO4 2) melt + 8Fe 2+ Omelt = (S 2) melt +8FeO1.5 melt  In this reaction dissolved sulfate is converted to dissolved sulfide and ferric iron which is an effective way to increase the oxidation state of the melt. The reaction responsible for the conversion of sulfate to sulfide and ferric iron will proceed to the right hand side, provided that the fO2 of the system is sufficiently  reduced, so that S 2 is the dominant sulfur species present in the melt. To illustrate this point, the relative stability of dissolved sulfide and dissolved sulfate    Figure 2 shows how the dissolution of sulfate changes the ferric iron content and fO2 of the melt. The initial fO2 of the melt was assumed to be ΔIW+0. Each of the red points on the curve represents the effects of the incremental addition of 250mg CaSO4 to 1 kg of melt.  The label above each of the points shows the total quantity CaSO4 added and the concomitant increase in bulk S content of the melt.   Figure 1 shows the speciation of dissolved sulfur in a basaltic melt as a function of fO2, as well as the redox space in which t sulfate assimilation should result in the net oxidation of the melt. have been calculated with the model of Wallace and Carmichael [4] and plotted in Figure 1. In other words, the addition of sulfate to the melt will result in the net oxidation of FeO in the melt to FeO1.5 as long as the fO2 of the system lies outside of the stability field of dissolved sulfate.    How Much Sulfate Assimilation Is Required to Move the "Redox Needle": Although the reactions that control the dissolution of crystalline sulfate with basaltic melts indicate that sulfate assimilation should increase the fO2 of the melt, the efficiency of the mechanism still needs to be tested. In order for sulfate assimilation to be a viable means for increasing the oxidation state of martian, the mass of sulfate required to oxidize the melt several log units should not be unrealistically large. We have calculated the effects of the dissolution variable masses of sulfate on the FeO1.5/FeO ratio and fO2 of a hypothetical martian basalt. For the sake of simplicity we have assumed in the modeling that the sulfate reacting with the melt is pure anhydrite. The Fe 3+ /ΣFe ratios of the melt have been calculated as a function of fO2 at 1200˚C using the model of Righter et al. [5]  The results of these calculations are presented in Figure 2. There are several important points that are highlighted by our calculations: 1) the assimilation of 1500 mg of CaSO4 per kg of magma is accompanied by an increase in the fO2 of the melt by nearly three orders of magnitude, 2) the increase in dissolved S content of the melt that accompanies the a ~3 log unit increase in fO2 is only 350ppm.  The effectiveness of sulfate assimilation as an oxidant is partially rooted in the behavior of Fe 3+ /ΣFe as for Fe enriched melts at low fO2 values.  The work of Righter et al. [5] demonstrated that the redox behavior of Fe-rich martian basalts is substantially different from that of low Fe terrestrial basalts. In particular the slope of the Fe 3+ /ΣFe curve is much less steep for martian basalts than it is for terrestrial basalts. The consequence of this behavior is that relatively small changes in the Fe 3+ /ΣFe cause a pronounced changes in the numerical fO2 value for the of the magma. For example, our modeling suggests that an increase fO2 from ΔIW+1 to ΔIW+2 is precipitated by a by increasing the Fe 3+ /ΣFe by a mere 0.01 (or 1%). Conclusions: Sulfate assimilation may exert an important influence on the oxidation state of martian magmas. The addition of small quantities (<1500ppm) of sulfate can substantially increase the oxidation state of the melt. We suggest that some of the in addition to other processes, sulfate assimilation may be responsible for some of the redox observed diversity in the intermediate and enriched shergottites. It is possible that the redox signatures of some of the meteorites in these groups (e.g. Los Angeles and LAR 06319) are not necessarily inherited from their mantle sources, but rather have been reset interactions with sulfate bearing crustal materials.
