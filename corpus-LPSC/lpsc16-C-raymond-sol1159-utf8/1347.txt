Introduction: The Curiosity rover is equipped with a number of instruments, including ChemCam, a Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument and a high resolution Remote Micro Imager (RMI) for context imaging. ChemCam allows to determine the chemical compositions of rocks and soils from 1.5 to 7 meters away from the rover. Major and minor elements are quantifiable using several methods.  Copper content variations are noteworthy due to Cu strong mobility and its redistribution during low-grade metamorphism such as hydrothermal alteration, during which it is highly concentrated into sulphide minerals. Here, we present the first ChemCam detection and quantification of copper using a univariate method [3] applied to a new lab database.  Laboratory databases: The lab database used here is the same as Payré et al. [5] for trace elements. However, as Cu is not present in all samples at concentrations higher than ~50 ppm, only 56 standards are considered for this calibration: 21 sediments, 18 distinct igneous rocks and 4 Mn-oxides and sulfates from different geological locations. This database is already Earth-to-Mars corrected using a transfer matrix calculated using onboard calibration targets. Their copper contents, varying from 50 to 1230 ppm, are quite representative of observed concentrations on Mars [6].  Copper quantification: The selected emission line for Cu quantification is at 327.40 nm. Two Ti lines located at 327.21 nm and 327.31 nm and a Na peak at 327.422 nm may infer with this Cu line, thus, we have deconvolve carefully these interferences. For each standard, five different LIBS observation points are analyzed. After pre-processing and normalization to the total emission by spectral range [1, 7], the Cu peak was fitted using a Lorentz function. We only consider the calculated area three times higher than the standard deviation of the background noise level. The five areas are averaged and a relative standard deviation is deduced.  In order to keep the most homogeneous lab samples, only averaged areas higher than 4 sigma are used. Figure 1 presents the univariate Cu calibration curve, fitted by a quadratic polynome. The root mean square of the errors (RMSE) is 45 ppm. As gaps in the Cu abundance distributions are present between 450 to 700 ppm and 700 to 1200 ppm, another calibration in the future will be improved by adding more laboratory standards.       Figure 1: Univariate calibration curve of Cu using the 327 nm emission line. Each data point is the average ± relative standard deviation of five observation points per standard.   Possible interferences with other elements such as Ti and Na have been checked. Titanium LIBS peaks at 327.21nm and 327.31nm are positively correlated with TiO2 composition (linear function on Figure 2a), but these lines are not correlated with Cu (Figure 2b), demonstrating that titanium lines do not infer with the selected Cu peak at 327 nm. We have also tested a potential interference with Na line (at 327.422nm), but no trend is visible in the Figure 2b (light blue diamonds).       Figure 2: (a) Area of Ti line versus TiO2 content. (b) TiO2 (dark blue diamonds) and Na2O (light blue diamonds) composition versus Cu area. Each data point is the average ± standard deviation of five measurements per standard.   Copper detection in Gale crater (see also [8]): Applying this Cu calibration to ChemCam data, more than 95% of ChemCam targets in Gale have Cu < 200 a b  ppm (Figure 3). The Martian Cu distribution completely covers the range of lab standard values, and no extrapolation is needed. It is worth noting that the ChemCam results overlap quite well the APXS data in spite of the huge difference in observational footprints. For example, for Liga target, the mean value of Cu using ChemCam is 430 ppm with a standard deviation of 320 ppm (highest Cu with 1050 ppm in point 5) while APXS measured ~500 ppm [6]. For Stephen, ChemCam yields Cu ~170 ±40 ppm while APXS results are between 200 and 350 ppm. Regarding low Cu values, the average in Square_Top is ~15 ±10 ppm with ChemCam and ~20 ppm for APXS. Concerning Portage soil, ChemCam measured ~50 ±25 ppm against ~20 ppm from APXS [6].  The average Cu abundance in Gale crater so far is ~83 ppm using ChemCam, in the range of the Earth's crustal Cu abundance where copper content is between 20 and 90 ppm [9, 10, 11]. The ChemCam average may be artificially slightly high due to difficulty observing abundances near zero or to sampling bias.      Figure 3: Distribution of the Martian Cu estimates in Gale crater in %.(dark blue <100ppm ; lighter blue 100-200ppm ; lighter blue 200-400ppm ; light blue 400-1100ppm)  Cu enrichment: In Gale, the most enriched targets are located in the Cooperstown and Kimberley areas where many K- and Fe-rich rocks have been encountered [8,12]. Since Cu and Fe have a great affinity, this is consistent with a copper enhancement in this area [13]. This could also explain that high Cu targets are mostly Fe-rich (e.g., Greenwater point 4 with FeO ~28 wt.% and Lamboo point 5 with FeO ~21 wt.%). It is well known that mobility of copper is higher under oxidizing and slightly acidic conditions (pH = 56) [13]. Thus, Cu could have precipitated from such fluids. We note that some other elements favoring these fluids are enriched in the same area. For example, Caribou point 5 has ~170 ppm Cu and >40 wt.% of MnO [4].  Cu is a chalcophile element showing a greater affinity for mafic than felsic igneous rocks [13]. The Cu-rich targets are often mafic materials (ex: Liga point 5 with 1050 ppm). Moreover, these particular points are enriched in zinc (Zn ~1000 ppm [14]) and iron (FeO ~19 wt.%). This may illustrate the coprecipitation of Cu with Zn in Fe-hydrous oxides.  Moreover, Laurens point 5 contains 875 ppm of copper and is also iron-rich (FeO ~27.9 wt.%) and seems to be sulfur-rich (Figure 4, [15]), suggesting the possible presence of a minor amount of chalcopyrite  (CuFeS2) mixed within the matrix.        Figure 4: Spectra of Laurens point 5 in purple and a calcium sulfate for reference (Rapitan point 5) in (a) the copper zone and (b) in the sulfur zone.   Conclusion: The new lab database provides the first LIBS copper quantification for Mars, with a reasonable RMSE. Copper abundances in Gale crater appear to be in the same range as on the Earth's crust. The highest Cu abundances are mostly observed at Cooperstown and Kimberley areas and can be mainly explained by co-precipitation with Fe-oxides in rocks.  References: [1] Wiens R.C. et al.
