Wiens et al. [1],  Sharma et al. [2], and Clegg et al. [3] demonstrated that these complementary analytical techniques can be integrated into a single instrument suitable for primary science investigations as well as a reconnaissance tool for other contact instruments. Raman, TRF and VISIR are sensitive to the molecular structure of the sample from which mineralogy can be determined definitively.  LIBS is sensitive to the elemental composition from which geochemistry is accurately determined. An overview of the entire SuperCam architecture on the Mars 2020 rover will be presented by Wiens et al.[4] This paper will focus on the integrated science that is determined with Raman, TRF, and LIBS. These techniques involve focusing a laser onto the surface of the sample, probing several hundred microns to several millimeter spot sizes enabling remote micro-scale geological investigations. Integration of these techniques into the same instrument ensures that the same sample locations are probed as the lasers are co-boresighted. Finally, the SuperCam integrated instrument meets several important Mars 2020 mission goals including context mineralogy, fine scale imaging, fine scale elemental composition and organic detection, while the inclusion of a RMI similar to that on ChemCam satisfies the context imaging requirement [5].  Experimental: The data were collected with experimental hardware that simulates the SuperCam instrument performance. The LIBS experiments involve the Los Alamos National Laboratory ChemCam testbed, a functional replica of the ChemCam instrument on Curiosity.  ChemCam focuses a Nd:KGW laser (1067 nm, 3 Hz, 14 mJ/pulse) onto a sample surface. The laser ablates material from the surface, generating an expanding plasma containing electronically excited atoms, ions and small molecules.  The excited species emit light at wavelengths diagnostic of the species present in the sample as they relax to lower electronic states. Some of this emission was collected with a 110 mm telescope and directed into the spectrometer suite.  The Raman and TRF experiments involve a separate experimental setup that directs a 1 cm diameter pulsed, doubled Nd:YAG laser (532 nm, 10 Hz, 10 mJ/pulse) onto the sample surface. The laser stimulates the Raman-active vibrational modes in the sample, producing the Raman emission. The laser simultaneously produces fluorescence signatures that are recorded with different delays from the laser trigger. Both experiments used the same 150 ns integration time. Some of this emission is collected with an 89 mm telescope and directed into the custom prototype miniature transmission spectrometer and recorded with a customized miniaturized intensified charge couple device (ICCD) operating at room temperature used to define the SuperCam transmission spectrometer. This transmission spectrometer was specifically designed to collect both the Raman signals to 4400 cm-1 (694.6 nm) as well as record the LIBS signals out to 860 nm.  Samples: A broad suite of pure minerals were analyzed at 4 and 12 m by Raman and at 4 m by LIBS.  The samples were placed in a vacuum chamber filled with 7 Torr CO2 to simulate the Martian surface pressure.  The pure mineral samples included aragonite (CaCO3), barite (BaSO4), calcite (CaCO3), dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2), gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), jarosite (KFe3+3(SO4)2(OH)6), olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4), quartz (SiO2), and talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2).  Discussion: Figures 1 and 2 contain LIBS and Raman spectra for olivine and gypsum samples and Figure 2 contains the TRF spectra for gypsum. These spectra are representative of the spectra collected for the minerals listed above. Olivine: The LIBS spectrum of the olivine clearly demonstrates that the sample is not pure (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 as the sample also includes Al, Na, and K. A complete elemental analysis of this sample would produce a composition from which one can infer an olivine mineralogical composition. However, the Raman spectrum in Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that the sample primarily contains olivine based on the observed 824 and 855 cm−1 spectral signatures. Gypsum: The LIBS spectrum is a characteristically simple CaSO4 spectrum dominated by Ca emission  lines similar to those observed routinely by ChemCam.  A hydrogen emission line at 656 nm is observed in the VNIR spectrometer indicating that the sample is either bassanite (CaSO4·0.5H2O) or gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O). The presence of potassium emission lines in the 770 nm region also suggests the presence of a trace amount of K in the mineral.  The Raman spectra of calcium sulfates produce many diagnostic peaks that can be exploited to differentiate anhydrite, bassanite and gypsum. The Raman spectrum in Figure 2 is consistent with gypsum containing the 1008 cm-1 SO4 ion symmetric stretching modes. TRF: The time resolved spectra in the bottom plot of Figure 2 recorded broad fluorescence structures underneath the relatively sharp Raman features. These TRF spectra were recorded with a 150 ns gate and the round trip time for the 8 ns laser pulse is ~26.6 ns. Consequently, the Raman structure is observed through the 65 ns delay. The relative fluorescence intensity decreases with increasing delay between the laser and the ICCD gate. The TRF signature is nearly gone after ~100 ns suggesting a relatively short fluorescence lifetime that is consistent with an organic impurity in the sample. Inspection of the sample depicted in Figure 2 suggests there is some amount of imbedded soil that may be the source of the fluorescence. In contrast, inorganic impurities tend to produce relatively long-lived fluorescence as described by Sharma et al. [6]. References: [1] Wiens R. C., et al. (2005) Spectrochim. Acta A 61, 2324-2334.
