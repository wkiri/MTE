1. generate jsre examples:
	python generate_jsre_examples.py # this mainly replaces solr server with the function to identify if a word-word pair exists in annotation.
	
	ONE IMPORTANT THING:
		the old version of jsre model uses system ners to generate examples( generate_example() takes t['ner'] which is prediction result of the ner system. this is replaced by gold ner now )
