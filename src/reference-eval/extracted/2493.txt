[1].   In these terrestrial desert soils, dust is trapped beneath pebbles on the surface, causing the gradual inflation of the landscape.  Importantly, on Earth such dust-rich horizons record not just the accumulated dust and age of the soil, but also show chemical alteration of the dust, with changes such as translocated salts deeper in the profiles indicating the rates and amount of water movement and chemical weathering 
[2].  This dust-rich layer preserves not only the composition of the deposited aeolian dust, but also evidence of any interactions with liquid water.  The dust-rich layer also strongly affects how liquid water interacts with soils.     Soils on Earth, including desert soils, can be stud-ied by analyzing depth profiles such as in soil pits or augered samples.  Changes with depth on Earth have been used to interpret profiles dominated by immobili-ty of elements, depletion of elements, depletion fol-lowed by enrichment of elements, addition of elements and biogenic impacts 
[3].  Depth profiles can also indi-cate information about soils such as the age of the soils, characteristics of interaction with liquid water, and composition of deposited dust.   ChemCam measurements at Gale Crater, Mars form depth profiles over different scales, including fine scale profiles formed by repeated shots in one location, as well as across transects of vertically exposed material, such as the example shown in 
[4], as well as, in one case, weathering indicated by mobility of Li 
[5].   Here, in order to examine potential soil-forming processes at Gale Crater, we examine transects at the millimeter scale measured by ChemCam through verti-cal soil exposures.       Methods:  First, NavCam images of ChemCam tar-gets were examined through sol 1062.  From these im-ages, steep to nearly vertical soils were identified visu-ally, such as the example shown in 
[6], transported downward.  On Earth, deposition of dust in desert soils forms dust-rich horizons that record the age of the soil, the composition of the deposited dust, and potential water: rock interactions and chemical weath-ering 
[9].  Examination of soils on Mars therefore has potential to similarly help interpret its history.   More work is needed to further interpret soil-forming processes on Mars.  Future work will include analysis of additional measurements from the MSL ChemCam instrument and comparison of analyzed soil surfaces and measured dust with soil profiles, as well as an investigation of soil variability.  Examination of possible Fe enrichment may also help better understand secondary materials previously observed in soils at Gale Crater
