[87]. In addition, VISIR spectroscopy might provide a tool to identify complex organic compounds from absorptions at 1.7 and 2.3-2.5 µm due to various combinations of CH2 and CH3 asymmetric and symmetric stretch 
[88].  SuperCam records atmospheric CO2, CO, H2O, O2 (IR and 700-850 nm) and O3 (UV). The full spectral range is used to measure scattered light diagnostic of aerosol size distribution, composition, and opacity. These measurements will be made by fitting the observed sky radiance to multiple-scattering discrete-ordinates radiative transfer models with gas absorption handled by the correlated-k method, as has been done with ChemCam 
[89]; cf. 
[90].
