Introduction: The Martian crust has been studied 
extensively through measurements from orbit and the 
surface, indicating that most of the crust is composed 
of mafic igneous rock[1]. Much of the surface also 
shows some extent of low temperature alteration. 
While most of this alteration can be explained by 
aqueous processes[2,3], there has been abundant orbital evidence for local hydrothermal metamorphism 
operating in some areas [4,5]. It has also been demonstrated that impacts into Mars surface could release 
sufficient energy to produce long-lived hydrothermal 
systems in and around craters[6,7]. MER rover Spirit 
encountered likely hydrothermal terrain at Home 
Plate, in Gusev Crater, with elevated levels of halogens, sulfur, and other volatile elements [8,9]. 
While it seems apparent that some form of hydrothermal alteration has taken place on the Martian surface, constraining the specific process remains difficult[9]. Phyllosilicates, unequivocal products of alteration, are generally produced in water-rich environments; however, much of the chemical alteration that 
has taken place on Mars throughout its most recent 
history has likely occurred at very low water-rock ratios[10] and in local environments where magmatic gases may have played an important role, such as in fumarolic systems. Understanding the mineralogy and 
chemistry of such systems is crucial for identifying 
other similar locales on the Martian surface. Furthermore, being able to recognize signatures of potential 
fumaroles from orbital observations could prove valuable when searching for prospective landing sites for 
future survey or sample return missions. These areas 
of magmatic activity would also be prime areas to continue to search for evidence of past or present life on 
the Martian surface[11]. To understand this process on 
Mars, we have initiated the design and implementation 
of a simulated fumarole. 
Experimental design: There are many considerations that go into designing an experiment that can 
accurately mimic a fumarolic environment on the Martian surface. There must be a source material or 
 magma that generates a vapor phase. There also 
must be a country rock (the target rock ) representing 
the material that is being altered. The source rock 
must be at higher temperature than the target. An oxygen fugacity consistent with the Martian surface must 
be maintained, and all should be isolated as much as 
possible from the terrestrial environment. 
Ideally, the source magma for the vapor phase 
should have a composition that is similar to rock found 
on Mars. The MER rovers analyzed several finegrained igneous rocks that may well have risen close to 
the surface while mostly, if not entirely liquid[12]. 
The rock Irvine is an example of one such basalt and 
chosen here as a source rock. Using this composition 
as a starting point, we are able to produce vaporsaturated magmas capable of releasing volatile gases. 
A target rock with plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine and glass can be synthesized using the same Irvine 
composition, but allowing it to partially crystallize. 
This is an approximate representation of an average Martian crust. We sought varied target rocks in order 
to better understand the effect of protolith composition 
on alteration products, so we will use synthesized Irvine glass as target rock because it should be more 
readily altered. Natural minerals such as albite, augite, 
and olivine were also used in this preliminary study. 
Experimental details: We have synthesized two 
 source magma mixtures of Irvine composition using oxide and silicate powders. One anhydrous mix contained halogens, added as MgCl2 and MgF2. A second 
hydrous mixture, but free of halogens contained water, 
added in the form of brucite (Mg[OH]2). Powders 
were separately loaded into individual graphite-lined 
platinum capsules, each pressurized to 1 GPa in a piston cylinder press, melted at 1400 C, then quenched to 
a glass. Equal parts of each glass were weighed and 
crushed together with added Zinc and Rubidium (as 
ZnO and RbN2). Separate mixes were employed in 
order to maximize the dissolved volatiles in each melt; 
chemical analyses are in Table 1. Note the low totals 
for the hydrous liquid, this is likely due to an added 
4.65% water; however detailed FTIR to quantify dissolved water has not been completed yet. For the alteration experiments, this glass was loaded into a 
Au80Pd20 capsule that was lightly crimped at the top to 
allow gases to escape. This capsule is placed inside 
the silica glass tube, on top of a small spacer (Fig. 1).

quartz was prepared and loaded into a separate 
Au80Pd20 capsule that was lightly crimped closed, but 
otherwise open to the atmosphere; this was placed inside the tube next to the source material. This serves 
to buffer our experiments at or near FMQ. 
The target rock for vapors to interact with and alter, 
is synthesized in a similar manner to the source rock. 
After synthesis of rock, solid chunks of sample (approximately 4-8mm long) are wrapped in a nest of W95Re5 (type W) thermocouple wire, that is sitting in a 
constriction made in the silica tube (Fig. 1). This setup 
allowed for maximum vapor flow around the target, 
while preventing the target material from coming into 
contact with the silica glass walls of the tubes they are 
contained in. Thermocouple wire was used because it 
is resistant to the heat, and thought to be relatively 
unreactive. Other experiments will employ a finely 
crushed target rock contained in Au80Pd20 capsules that 
have been perforated with holes and left open to the 
vapors inside the silica glass. This will help to maximize surface area and therefore increase chances for 
formation of secondary minerals. 
 Figure 1- Diagram of the silica glass tube suspended inside of a vertical furnace for vapor-alteration experiments. Entire tube is approximately 25cm long. 
The silica tube assembly is evacuated and sealed 
shut, with a small hook at the top, as shown in Figure 
1. The tube is suspended inside of a vertical Pt-wound 
furnace; the temperature gradient of the furnace has 
been carefully calibrated with a dummy tube in 
place, so that the temperature of the source and target 
is well known. The sample and buffer are placed in the 
hottest part of the tube (~1200 C), thereby, permitting 
the sample to melt and boil off dissolved gasses. 
These gases then rise upwards towards the cooler sample (< 400 C), where they can interact with, and alter 
the minerals present. These temperatures were chosen 
as they are within the range for terrestrial fumarolic 
systems [14]. 
Results: Proof-of-concept experiments were conducted using olivine crystals as the target material. 
The preliminary results show that for experiments lasting for 8-12 hours, we are able to maintain the integrity 
of the silica tube. XRD analysis of the buffer following recovery of the sample demonstrated that the three 
minerals remain in the buffering assembly. This also 
appeared to be of sufficient time to cause alteration of 
the target sample, as well as deposition of sublimates 
inside of the silica tube. 
Reaction of the olivine was evident when comparing the reacted target with a control target that was 
exposed to these temperatures at vacuum. The reacted 
target olivine was visibly discolored, and coated in a 
fine yellow/orange powder that also appeared to coat 
the inside of the silica glass tube above (and at a lower 
temperature than) the sample. Condensed fluid was 
also apparent inside the tube. Preliminary analyses 
have demonstrated the transport of Cl, Fe, Zn, and Au 
(presumably from the capsule) from the source to the 
target and upper walls of the tube. Quantitative ICPMS analyses of the vapor deposits/sublimates on the 
inner walls of the silica glass will be forthcoming. The 
target samples will be analyzed by SEM, XRD, and 
Raman spectroscopy to identify any newly produced 
mineral species. Visible near infrared (VNIR) and 
thermal infrared (TIR) spectroscopy will also be conducted to try and identify an alteration fingerprint for hydrothermal systems at the surface.
