 Introduction:
Both Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), Spirit and Opportunity, as well as Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity have come across meteorites on Mars [1-4], and such finds had been predicted [5]. The majority of these finds so far are iron meteorites but this is probably because they are easier to spot than stony meteorites. Chunks of metallic iron glinting in the sun appear otherworldly, even on another world. MER Opportunity, however, also identified several candidate stony meteorites [1,2,6]. Meteorite finds on Mars are interesting not least because they can tell us much about the Red Planet itself. Metallic iron as present in most meteorites is a sensitive tracer for water exposure [7]. Common meteorite types can be thought of as standard calibration points that allow us to quantify chemical weathering: materials with essentially identical compositions that are being deposited continually onto all surfaces in a wide range of environments, with fall compositions that stay the same over geological timescales. Terrestrial ages can be obtained from cosmogenic radionuclides, and (given that iron in equilibrated OCs or achondrites exists as Fe
0
 or Fe
2+
) the abundance of ferric iron may be taken as a measure of terrestrial alteration [e.g. 8]. This combination of factors provides an empirical means of deriving quantitative weathering in any environment where meteorites are found. If an exposure age can be determined it also applies to Mars. Here we use the Martian stony meteorite finds
ferric iron content to determine what we believe is the first quantitative chemical weathering rate for Mars. Results and Discussion:
 Stony meteorites at Meridiani Planum.
Among the many loose rock fragments that Opportunity investigated in detail [9,10], four were identified as meteorites on the basis of their metallic iron content [1,2]. The chemical composition of all four is most consistent with the HED group of meteorites although they contain more metal and olivine than HEDs generally do. They thus resemble the silicate clasts of mesosiderites, which are a group of stony irons [1,2]. Because of their chemical and mineralogical similarity and because they appear to belong to a rare group of meteorites rather than ordinary chondrites they are most likely paired, despite their serendipitous discovery several kilometers apart from each other [2].
Martian
age of stony meteorites.
One of the stony meteorites, dubbed Santa Catarina, was found at the rim of 750 m diameter Victoria crater [11]. It was part of a wider boulder and cobble field, and remote sensing observations indicate that many of these rocks have the same composition as Santa Catarina [2,6,11]. The other three stony meteorites are located further away from the Victoria crater rim, but that distance is within the range of meteorite debris found around terrestrial impact craters such as Meteor Crater in Arizona [2]. All are located on the Victoria crater annulus, which has been interpreted as the Victoria ejecta blanket that has been eroded and smoothed ~1 m and covered by sand [12]. The paired stony meteorites may therefore be part of the impactor that formed Victoria [2,11] or formed after the Victoria annulus formed. The age of Victoria crater has been estimated at ~10-20 Ma based on the oldest crater on the annulus, with a possible range of 4-25 Ma based on uncertainties and the retention age of craters in this portion of Meridiani Planum [13]. Here we apply 10 Ma as the time of the fall of the stony meteorites. Chemical weathering rate.
Bland and co-workers used ordinary chondrite (H and L) finds from terrestrial hot and cold deserts to determine weathering rates, with ferric iron content measured by M ssbauer spectroscopy [14]. The iron mineralogy and ferric iron content of the Martian finds have been determined using Opportunity s M ssbauer spectrometer [15]. Although the Martian finds are not ordinary chondrites, their iron mineralogy is similar to L and LL chondrites (Fig. 1), and we can therefore compare weathering rates. Comparison of Martian and terrestrial weathering and erosion rates.
Figure 2 shows iron oxidation as a function of terrestrial or Martian age. It is clear that chemical weathering rates are much lower for cold deserts (Antarctica) than hot deserts (Sahara, Australia, SW USA) on Earth. The Martian weathering rate is significantly lower than even the terrestrial cold desert weathering rate. Average erosion rates on Mars since the Noachian are 2-3 orders of magnitude slower than typical erosion rates on Earth (minimum ~1 m/Ma) and are consistent with the present day dry and desiccating environment [13]. Erosion over the past 20 Ma at Meridiani Planum is dominated by eolian activity and abrasion with no 2354.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)
evidence for liquid water [13], consistent with the extremely slow weathering of iron.

Survival time of meteorites on Mars.
On Earth, the longest meteorite residence times, on the order of a few 10
6
 years, have been reported for Antarctic finds [5]. On the basis of chemical weathering rates derived for cold deserts, meteorites might survive under Antarctic conditions on the order of 10
8
 years, but that timescale by far exceeds climate stability and surface ages on the continent. On Mars, however, in the absence of largescale erosion and weathering due to the scarcity of water and cold average temperatures and without plate tectonics, meteorites may indeed survive for even billions of years, in line with predictions by Bland and Smith [5]. Implications on past climate.
These long survival times are significant with respect to changes in Martian climate conditions as derived from iron meteorite discoveries on Mars. Although there is some evidence for oxidized iron on their surface [1,3,17], they appear largely pristine. Many iron meteorite surfaces have regmaglypts that are produced by atmospheric ablation during descent through the atmosphere implying subsequent changes have not removed them. On the other hand, they show cavernous weathering suggesting aqueous alteration that has been enhanced by eolian abrasion [3]. Some have suggested that some of the iron meteorites fell during the wet Noachian or Hesperian periods [18] and others have argued that their mass requires a thicker atmosphere [19], except that observations of the weathering of the iron meteorites do not support a wet environment [3] and subsequent dynamical work shows that the iron meteorites at Meridiani could have landed in the present thin atmosphere [20]. The chemical weathering rate we have derived here on the basis of the stony meteorite finds are consistent with the possibility of meteorites suriving on the Martin surface for up to several billion years during the dry and desiccating environment throughout the Amazonian and into the Hesperian.
