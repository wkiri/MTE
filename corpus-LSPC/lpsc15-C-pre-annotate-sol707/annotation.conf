[relations]

# Definition of (binary) relations.

# Format in brief: one relation per line, with first space-separated
# field giving the relation type and the rest of the line the
# comma-separated arguments in ROLE:TYPE format. The roles are
# typically "Arg1" and "Arg2".
#Contains    Arg1:Target, Arg2:Component
# I don't see how to link the third argument using the GUI.
#Contains    Arg1:Target, Arg2:Component, Arg3:Attribute
#	Contains_high   Arg1:Target, Arg2:Component
#	Contains_low    Arg1:Target, Arg2:Component
#	May_contain     Arg1:Target, Arg2:Component
#Lacks       Arg1:Target, Arg2:Component

[events]

# Definition of events.

# Format in brief: one event per line, with first space-separated
# field giving the event type and the rest of the line the
# comma-separated arguments in ROLE:TYPE format. Arguments may be
# specified as either optional (by appending "?" to role) or repeated
# (by appending either "*" for "0 or more" or "+" for "1 or more").

[attributes]

# Definition of entity and event attributes.

# Format in brief: first tab-separated field is attribute name, second
# a set of key-value pairs. The latter must define "Arg:" which
# specifies what the attribute can attach to (typically "<EVENT>").
# If no other keys are defined, the attribute is binary (present or
# absent). If "Value:" with multiple alternatives is defined, the
# attribute can have one of the given values.

# Unused by the annotation GUI, sadly
